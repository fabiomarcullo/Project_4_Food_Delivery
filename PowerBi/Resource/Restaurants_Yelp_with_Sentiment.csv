Miku,Japanese,"200 Granville Street Suite 70 Vancouver, BC V6C 1S4 Canada",BC,49.2868259,-123.112583,5,"wow wow wow bite after bite was a sublime experience in what japanese fine dining can be  miku is a five star experience that deserves your visit

the modern restaurant is beautiful clean and perfectly maintained  we recommend sitting on the patio where you can either people watch or gaze over the harbour  inside tables offer window views or a view of the open kitchen  its all beautiful and adds to the experience

service is professional friendly and gracious  we followed our servers recommendations and that was the right choice  a team of people keeps the meal moving along and provides explanations of what you are eating

however the food is the star here and that is how it should be  the flavors are carefully paired here and you will want to give those flavors a chance to delight your palette  this is not sushi to be dunked in soya sauce  i think you will also be delighted by how their cocktails complement the food choices

put miku on your special meal out list and make an evening of it  this is one of vancouvers dining gems and certainly the best japanese cuisine i have eaten  i think you will agree",0.9956,Good

in addition to the fried chicken kosoo also offers a variety of other korean dishes that are equally delicious the bibimbap is a standout with a flavorful mix of rice vegetables and protein that is sure to satisfy the side dishes such as the kimchi and pickled radish are also great

the service at kosoo is friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is casual and cozy the restaurant is relatively small so it can get quite busy during peak hours but the wait is usually not too long

took 20 minutes for a waitsperson to approach our table another 30 minutes for the food no one checked up on us for the next 30 minutes eventhough we wanted to order more stuff
we were initially offered a plate with a bug on it which grossed me out and isnt acceptable as we were one of the only 2 tables of customers in the store  would have been ok if it was busy but it wasnt
took over 10 minutes for catch the attention of someone to get new plates they replaced the plates  offered no apology

overall the foods good but it isnt worth the waiting and the lack of service

weve previously ordered through online platforms but the food arrived bland and messy  however in inperson dining the food tasted good would probably recommend one of their other locations over this one",0.3653,Bad

while i dont have photos of everything we ordered the raw oysters were fresh and sweet prawns were plump and juicy and sashimi was fresh and paired with an in house soy sauce i ordered the beef tenderloin and asked for it to be cooked between medium rare and rare and it was cooked to perfection it was tender seared crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside i also ordered the truffle fries as a side and will say you have to try them

each course from their antipasti to their primi to their secondi boast not more than six options per heading so im guessing that they curated the best of the best i was intrigued because in my mind that meant they had really perfected these dishes and wanted to showcase their culinary prowress with the thoughtful handling of select dishes so i was expecting a stellar meal

i dont think ive ever had the pleasure of dining in a heritage house so there was already an air of charm surrounding the evening as we walked up the steps i was immediately struck by the eclectic decor an odd mix of wine bottles photographic prints abstract paintings unusual lighting and segmented ombre metallics im not sure it necessarily all worked together but it was definitely eyecatching

the food was simply fantastic we started with the popular focaccia bread a puffed vegetarian wonder which if you didnt know any better would think was a miniature pizza my girlfriend had the octopus mosaic which was a work of art and i had the wagyu beef carpaccio which had a lot of reggiano shavings both were delicious

mains consisted of the taglierini and fettucine where the portions were more than generous my only complaint about my fettuccine was that there were way too many peas otherwise both pastas were al dente and very flavorful

im happy to say that all the reviews about lupo were correct as it was one of the best italian restaurants ive been to in a while and i would definitely go back service was attentive and professional so you really couldnt ask for more

the vibe was upbeat and you are made to get into that personable mindset as the staff members seem to be  from the reception to the initial greeting at the table and the overall service i would have preferred the tables and seats to be a bit farther apart for more semiprivacy but packing in that many patrons also made business sense

it was my uncles treat and i think the servers already got the cue from that considering he was the more senior at our table and staff members were engaging him more but the servers also were not short of properly addressing us when it was our turn to say something acknowledgement of presence was never short and i loved it about their service theyre absolutely attentive and also steadfast if the water levels on glasses were low someone was on it and they had that openhands stance about their demeanor in engaging us someone would swing by every now and then to check in on us and the staff members were not snoots this is probably the best experience ive had in a while

the food doesnt feel fresh my friend ordered the unagi a week ago and said that it was very fishy to the point she pushed it away after the first bite

i ordered the beef bowl and the taste was great only problem was that the beef was rubbery hard hard to chew like rubber hard to swallow with my friends comment about this place and my current experience

i dont think the food is very fresh

i think this is for a persons personal experience perhaps the beef was meant to be like rubber because of its cooked methods

and i havent been to this place for all its food so its hard to comment but my first impression of it was not so good i would say that one can give this place a chance but that person might meet the same experience that my friend and i had

i get the fried chicken every time i come they sweetness balances off everything nicely and the pickles are just the cherry on top

88pp for 4 courses  menu said for an overall 11 dishes  fyi the appies were 4 hours derve sized bites which accounted for 4 dishes

appies  45 loved all of them but nothing over the top special

bison salad 05 it was soo salty it tasted bitter

halibut coconut sour soup  25
didnt quite give us the kick expected
it jusy tasted like a coconut broth

they offered us the shrimp salad after which we enjoyed the shrimp was definitely undercooked you can still see the raw center but i trust that its sashimi grade and ate nothing special  taste more like a viet dish 35

sablefish curry  55 fish was cooked perfectly more very flavourful and perfect with rice

pork belly pad cha  35 good but nothing special

desert hazelnut cake and coconut jelly 25
hazlenut cake got soggy from the sauce but i loved the brulee on top
coconut jelly was super dense i think they might have used too much agar agar but it wasnt too sweet and had a lot of  what felt like fresh coconut meat

overall a good dining experience but missed the mark for us on many things we probably wont be back
for comparison we really enjoy sawasdee for thai food taste is on point and authentic but obv theyre atmosphere and plating is not compatible

Linh Cafe,Vietnamese,"1428 Granville Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 1N2 Canada",BC,49.2746224,-123.129706,3,"food was great but service was poor

first of all the restaurant does not accept reservations for a party smaller than 6 or 8 cant remember exactly but we have 5 ppl therefore we purposely arrived earlier for dinner which was around 520pm we were immediately told by the host that we need to finish our dinner by 715pm in order to let the next reserved party sit down that sort of rubbed us in the wrong way to begin with but we accepted the challenge

then more issues with our waitress she was very polite but i think this is more of a training issue for her she was filling our glasses with a red sangria but it was dripping all over the table then it dripped on my friends light color dress she was apologetic and helped my friend to clean it then once again she reminded us we will need to finish dinner by 715pm during the whole dinner she was constantly interrupting our conversation by collecting empty dishes or even unfinished dishes at one point she collected all of our utensils and plates but there was still food left to eat we were already quite annoyed by that it feels like the kitchen was out of dishes and plates that they needed to collect them as soon as the customers are somewhat done with the food

finally we were paying the bill and our waitress brought over the credit card machine but basically walked right up to our friends back and leaned over against him thats the reason why we believe all of this is more of a training issue she needs to learn to give space and privacy to their customers and how to pour properly this is a higher end vietnamese restaurant and the service certainly did not feel that way",0.9625,Good

after perusing the extensive menu we decided to try a variety of dishes we started with the yellowfin tuna tartare which had a strong sesame oil flavor that overpowered the dish however the homemade potato chips served alongside it were exceptionally crispy with a bold potato flavor we wished we could have ordered the chips alone as a snack

next we had the nem  ch·∫£ gi√≤  spring roll which my friend loved while i found it to be a bit salty for my liking the filling was delicious and wellseasoned

the chicken liver was served with a creamy dijon mustard sauce that complemented the dish well however we felt it could have been even better if the liver had been marinated prior to cooking

the fried frog legs were a standout dish for us seasoned with garlic butter chili flakes and fresh herbs the frog legs were incredibly tender and perfectly complemented by the garlic butter i highly recommend trying it

the duck breast wasnt as impressive as we had hoped while it was served with glazed apples and grapes we found the fruits to be the highlight of the dish the duck breast itself seemed overcooked and lacked the desired tenderness

lastly we tried the ph·ªü b√≤ with braised beef brisket rice noodles and bone marrow we were blown away by the rich and flavorful beef bone soup base and the perfectly cooked rice noodles the bone marrow however wasnt to our liking

to end our meal on a high note we indulged in the restaurants delicious bread it was so good that we each finished an entire loaf

the fish cakes bebola ikan were phenomenal and worked as a great compliment to the meal extremely fresh home made and no fuss grub with solid ingredients and flavors

the calamari was really plain i wouldnt recommend my friend said her souvlaki was wellseasoned and enjoyable my lamb was cooked well but they didnt have any mint sauce or mint jelly to go with my lamb which i was surprised and heavily disappointed by

overall the food was mediocre

the food was a 35 but the experience was a 25
would maybe be willing to give this place another try for dinner or at its gastown location",0.8232,Good

1  made reservations online weeks ago and when we get there we get a high top table when there was a booth spot  hostess made the change after i made a request
2  server was pushing the special and adding lobster tails at every interaction  she was pretty aggressive with her recommendations as if she gets commission for every lobster tail that gets ordered when we wanted to share entrees and app thats when the level of service really decreased  she barely came by after taking our order and i think we waited over half an hr before the food came  the restaurant was not busy so not sure what took so long for the food and there was no reassurance from her food was coming
3  the food was okthe 22oz steak we shared was bland and the server said the chef recommends having it medium but there were parts of it that were rare  the lobster tails were bland and doesnt look appetizing

honestly i shouldnt have given her the 18 gratuity thats the 1st button on the keypad but i was there with girlfriends for a bachelorette party  it took so long to get our food we didnt even get a chance to order dessert bc we had reservations for drinks somewhere else

the ambiance of the place was lovely with dim lighting i really enjoyed the music jazz

everything was delicious the only complaint was that the entr√©e took an hour to get to our table after our appetizers

for starters we got the onion soup and the beef tartare the portions were quite large almost equivalent to our entr√©es we really enjoyed both of them

it was my first time having a coq au vin so i was excited although i didnt enjoy it very much i dont think it was a problem with the restaurant maybe just not a fan of the dish itself

the steak was cooked perfectly according to our preference and it was delicious

the space is clean and open and aromatic on sundays they have live piano music with a pianist named bruno

the low star ratings is due to the fact that i am a little disappointed in their food

we ordered a focaccia but it was more like pizza crust in that it was thin very hard and chewy instead of thick and soft usually focaccia is a dimpled soft bread with italian seasonings similar to pizza bread we also ordered the pizza and it had what seemed like the same bread base as the focaccia 

the tagliatelle ragu is a little bland

the eggplant and homemade sausage margarita pizza wasnt that good the eggplant didnt lend any interesting depth or flavor i wish the sausage was more spiced

youll want to make a reservation if you want a better chance at getting a seat walkins are possible but fill up quick paid street parking is available and relatively cheap couple of dollars for the 23h duration we were there

their great ratings do not lie  the food is comforting and delicious portions are good considering the cost the decor is light and minimal their staff are all excellent in friendliness attentiveness and speed

the potato pancakes had perfect crisp to it and were very flavourful on their own  no sauce really needed the vegetarian japchae was so satisfying that we didnt even miss the meat

i loved the grilled mackerel the most not overly cooked with a softly cooked interior while maintaining a crispy skin it even came with a small doenjang jjigae  super flavourful soup broth with bits of beef

all the appies kimchi beans potato salad were a perfect sample taste i wonder if i could have asked for more

Little Bird Dim Sum,Dim Sum,"2958 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6K 1R4 Canada",BC,49.2683086,-123.1715733,5,"i grew up in hk and shanghai so i hold most dim sum to a pretty high regard some dishes have a fusion take to them but for the most part the taste of each dish is pretty authentic id rate it an 8510 for authenticity with the best places in richmond ranking 9 on my scale the accompanying sauces were a mix of old classics and new interesting takes wasabi mustard but i didnt really use them much in my opinion the taste aligns more with the younger demographic its definitely more flavorful and stronger i find other dim sum places to be on the bland side sometimes to cater to the elderly and constantly find myself drowning my food in sauces i really liked the shrimp corn dumplings and the fried wontons not my usual go to at dim sum and i was pleasantly surprised i wouldve taken better photos but the food was too good

yes theres better dim sum to be had in van for cheaper but those places have bad service most top tier dim sum restaurants also turn into fancy chinese dining at night so little bird is a solid alternative option this place is a little more elegant and date friendly great spot to go to after a day hanging around in the area

lots of the reviews point to the price which is understandable our table was 50 a head 42 food 8 alcohol so really not that bad in comparison to a dim sum bill in richmond we had a lot of leftovers too",0.9956,Good

Robba da Matti,Italian,"1127 Mainland Street Vancouver, BC V6B 5P2 Canada",BC,49.2754667,-123.1213319,1,"unfair mandatory tip policy imposing on a group of five 

i am deeply disappointed with my recent visit not only did they enforce a mandatory 20 tip but they also insisted on applying it to my group of five even though the policy clearly states it is for groups of six or more

first the server nor anything on the reservation page informed us about the mandatory 20 tip and i was shocked when she insisted that we had to pay the 20 tip despite having only five people in our group according to their own policy this tip should not have been applied to us

what made matters worse was the servers complete lack of concern or understanding she made it clear that she had no intention of rectifying the situation or offering any sort of compromise her dismissive and rude attitude only added to the frustration we felt as paying customers

she stated that since we made a reservation of 6 people this mandatory tip policy applied to us because she spent her time reserving the table for us however i mentioned that they were going to seat us a 6people table regardless and she can inform us beforehand

springing it on us at the end of the meal especially when it doesnt even apply to our group size is both unfair and deceptive

i believe that a restaurants success lies not only in the quality of its food but also in the way it treats its customers unfortunately this restaurant failed to deliver on both fronts the mandatory tip policy and the servers poor attitude have left me with a negative impression that i cannot ignore

in conclusion i would caution others considering dining here to be wary of their unfair mandatory tip policy if you value transparency and fair treatment as a customer i recommend seeking alternatives where your dining experience is valued and respected",-0.9597,Bad

peanut soup tasted amazing platter portion had a little bit of everything for both veg and non veg they even offered choices of curries for the non veg platter where we could choose some of the dishes we liked as we do not consume beef

Harambe Restaurant,Ethiopian,"2149 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5N 4B3 Canada",BC,49.26556679999999,-123.0699715,1,"my friends and i recently had the opportunity to dine at harambe ethiopian restaurant and i must say it was a disappointing experience we had high hopes for this place but unfortunately we encountered a few issues that left me with a bad taste in my mouth quite literally

first and foremost the injera a traditional ethiopian flatbread was not up to par it had a rather unpleasant sour taste which took away from the overall enjoyment of the meal one of the spinach side dishes too was sour and i stayed away from a second helping of that dish

to make matters worse one of my friends found a fly in their drink attached is the picture of it this was not only unappetizing but also a major hygiene concern its unacceptable for a restaurant to serve beverages with insects in them and it definitely affected our dining experience worst part the waitress initially argued that it wasnt a fly until she saw it herself

but the most disturbing incident occurred when our waitress dipped her finger tip into our drink to scoop something out this was a complete breach of basic food handling practices and left us feeling extremely uncomfortable its essential for the staff to maintain proper hygiene standards and this incident was a glaring violation

given these experiences i regret to say that i would not consider returning to harambe ethiopian restaurant the issues we encountered were too significant to overlook and they greatly impacted our overall impression of the place i value cleanliness quality and attentive service when dining out and unfortunately this restaurant failed to meet these expectations

i hope the management of harambe ethiopian restaurant takes these concerns seriously and works towards improving their food quality and hygiene practices until then i would advise potential diners to exercise caution when considering this establishment for a meal",-0.9754,Bad

after we finished eating and paid the bill we told the manager whose name starts with p about the mice but guess what he acted like it was no big deal he said its totally normal to see mice in downtown restaurants and that were just not used to it because were from outside the downtown area like seriously

we expressed our concerns about the hygiene and how it could put peoples health at risk not to mention all the utensils food and table settings would be exposed to potential contamination but he just brushed us off and said its none of our business to ask about what theyre doing to address the issue can you believe the nerve

honestly we felt so grossed out and upset by the whole thing with his indifferent attitude we decided to get out of there as fast as we could its so disappointing to experience this in a supposedly fancy restaurant we wont be going back thats for sure this whole ordeal left us seriously questioning their quality and safety standards

i had a tandoori jackfruit feast platter the feast platters are very customizable you can choose your protein sauces type of rice basmati or cauliflower the veggies you want in your salad and if you want to add any hummus andor tzatziki dip i was super happy with the platter i built the tandoori sauce was as flavourful as i hoped for and pretty spicy but that mightve just been the jalape√±os i added and the cooling tzatziki went really well with it it was also very filling
for dessert i tried the keto new york cheesecake mixed experience with this the cheesecake had a very light texture similar to some nobake cheesecakes but with the fullbodied tangy flavour of a baked cheesecake and i really liked how unique it was but i think it was frozen in the middle and the biscuit crust was a little dry in a freezerburnt way there was a dollop of what looked like whipped cream on top but tasted like and had the thickness of butter which i had to discard because it was too rich for me and didnt have any flavour to contribute
i asked about decaf coffeeespresso when i ordered and they dont carry it but tea was suggested as an alternative so i ordered a green tea the bag wasnt labelled but it tasted like a sencha which is one of my favourites

one area of improvement would be the selection of nonalcoholic drinks which was somewhat limited it would be nice to see a wider variety of options in that regard on the other hand i must commend the kitchen on the fantastic calamari it was cooked to perfection and had a delicious flavor that left me wanting more
however i found the ravioli with shrimp to be a bit too sweet for my taste while it may appeal to those who enjoy sweeter flavors i personally would have preferred a more balanced taste

J & J Wonton Noodle House,Chinese,"1012 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8V 3K4 Canada",BC,48.4238736,-123.3561296,5,"i dont give a five star very often but this place blew me away first off for anyone else thats gluten free or celiac the absolute peace of mind that you can order something made in a gf kitchen and not be stressed out about problems is phenomenal

secondly their gf menu is a second standalone which was nicely flushed out with a mixture of dishes ive read other reviewers talking about the cost and yes it is a bit over average but i guess the dishes i ordered were just on the mark all three were very large servings and good ingredients plus you know when you are used to glutenfree lifestyle you unfortunately get used to very high prices so this seemed reasonable for me

go to be honest it was my first sit down since the pandemic so i was pretty excited but the whole experience was great didnt wait long for a table had excellent and attentive service very open to answer questions and make suggestions no awkward having to explain being glutenfree or asking about ingredients in substitutions it was just easy i had a nice seat facing the street in the window for some people watching

the food did not take long and filled my entire table i guess because its been a long time since ive eaten out  but i was shocked at how much food there was on my plate my three dishes lasted me 3 12 meals and if you havent read my reviews before i eat big

ok lets talk about the food
i did shoot a great video of it but unfortunately you cant upload it so check out my pictures

i had a combination of standard chinese dishes and one fun dish being the tofu eggplant hot pot which came so hot it was bubbling for a good five minutes
so you get entertainment and a meal  nice balance of hot sweet and sour a little bit too much thin sauce for my liking and i wouldve liked some shiitake mushroom in there  but thats a personal choice

the other dishes were your standard chinese fare the first was mixed greens with prawn which had the standard chinese take away flavor one which i hadnt had since before glueing glutenfree so that was pretty fantastic msg enhanced highly likely however i didnt have the response to it so maybe not

and the last was the recommendation by my server for the garlic ginger beef with snow peas im still shocked at how much beef was on that plate  seriously look at the pictures very well seasoned the beef was surprisingly tender considering its not a highquality cut which means they braised it properly veggies were perfect colour and crunchy texture   couldve done with a bit less oil but otherwise nice

obviously had a lot leftover to take away and they were great with the whole experience no awkwardness no fuss  they brought really decent quality eco take away containers    then gave me the time and space to put my food the way that i wanted

the crab cakes eggs benny is a must try
very flavorful crab cakes topped with sliced avocado and a perfectly poached egg tasty potatoes on the side and a creamy and zesty hollandaise sauce to pour over top

buffalo chicken wings were thickly breaded and really delicious

the seafood chowder was filled with yummy bites

the french toast was amazing it had so much flavour on its own but then it was paired with fruits and a cinnamon whip on the side you hardly have a need for any syrup

the reuben was juicy and not overly salty as others can be

the calamari was a bit odd and the least flavorful thing i tried

the steak was my absolute favourite dish perfectly cooked with a delicious flavoured butter and nice crust on the outside and rich sauteed mushrooms

the fish and chips were exactly what youd expect and they do have good fries

the cappuccino chocolate terrine dessert was nice and rich without being overly sweet despite it missing the raspberry sauce as advertised the chocolate was smooth and the almond bark on top was crunchy im not actually sure where the cappuccino flavour is meant to be but im an espresso addict so i tend to not be able to taste coffee flavours unless they are overly pronounced",0.9922,Good

beer selection solid nothing fancy you gonna find something you like for sure are you going to find that special beer youve been looking for most likely not

food solid whenever we are in a big group with multiple dietary restrictions we come here as we can always find something for everyone yet none of the menu items alone stand out as the best in town for their category

service solid this of course changes depending on the server how busy the place is andor if theres an event going on but overall i had 95 positive experiences yet none of them truly memorable

additional comment with all due respect but we also ordered hot meals and ate it on the outdoor table of your restaurant so are you saying that even if we order hot meals we cannot have the additional grab and go food reheated in your microwave how is that helping your customer half the order is hot and half the order isnt allowed to be reheated because its to go if we knew about this in the first place we wouldnt have ordered any to go with the hot meals

i was a fan of your restaurant since we ate here multiple times it wasnt the first time but to tell your customer to go eat somewhere else because reheating is a big deal shows the value you place on your once loyal customers  again we wont mind if theres a sign saying this

ps

it might help to place a sign on the cold section that the food here cannot be reheated even if customer orders hot meals in that way it avoids confusion",0.9373,Good

their great ratings do not lie  the food is comforting and delicious portions are good considering the cost the decor is light and minimal their staff are all excellent in friendliness attentiveness and speed

the potato pancakes had perfect crisp to it and were very flavourful on their own  no sauce really needed the vegetarian japchae was so satisfying that we didnt even miss the meat

i loved the grilled mackerel the most not overly cooked with a softly cooked interior while maintaining a crispy skin it even came with a small doenjang jjigae  super flavourful soup broth with bits of beef

all the appies kimchi beans potato salad were a perfect sample taste i wonder if i could have asked for more

Picnic Too,Coffee & Tea,"1019 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8V 3K5 Canada",BC,48.4234258,-123.3560499,4,"ordered the congee

as a biased person being asian it was not the congee i expected especially visually this one was outstanding with colors and textures the bold ingredients were sitting atop a bed of thick brown rice the rice was not too viscous and also not as fluid as asian congee would be generally  it might be close to the viscosity of oats where it will still fall out of your spoon if you tip it over but not immediately

the temperature also is quite different  im guessing this was about 50c  122f

so eating the congee the ingredients were grouped together and arranged quite thoughtfully i thought of mixing everything together just like you generally would in an asian congee but my senses at this point whispered otherwise

so i went about my dish picking the ingredients often combining 23 at a time as i was scouring away from the bed of viscous rice underneath i found that eating it this way gives an easier time to distinguish and appreciate the flavors and textures as compared to having everything mixed together  this made the dish quite engaging as you try different combinations of the ingredients it was light yet felt

for the entrees my husband ordered the halibut burger  but somehow ended up with the twopiece halibut fish and chips he went with it and didnt have any regrets the batter wasnt overly thick and the fish was thankfully not dry my own order was spicy prawn tacos and they were lovely nice light refreshing it comes with a side but thankfully i chose this because the appetizers were filling enough the fries were nothing remarkable but i did enjoy them

we arrived around 530pm to which dinner was just getting started the tables were about 90 full and our food still arrived at a reasonable time we were in and out in an hour without rushing our order and dinner  the atmosphere was overall good didnt feel rushed didnt feel like we were inconveniencing anyone when we asked for refills of our drinks i will of course come back again even for a somewhat priceconscious person im very satisfied with my visit

highlights for me
accessible washroom
twoforone appetizer saturdays excluding a few items
easy parking
good service and food

take note

description says they specialize in bubble tea but there was no bubble tea on the lunch menu i looked we ordered the ginger beef combo one wonton soup and the daily special which is the same every day by the way i believe that was pork fried noodles and fried shrimp on bean sprouts

wonton soup broth tasted exactly like chicken broth with more salt frozen wontons so so disappointing there might have been beef in the ginger beef or maybe it was just skinny strips of fried batter dunked in sweet sauce with ginger chunks the fried shrimp had bland batter bean sprouts no flavor at all saving grace is sweet and sour pork as well as fried rice were were fine

the staff came over to ask us if everything was ok well yeah it was ok so thats  what we said i didnt think asking for home made broth simmered for hours or more meat would be very feasible for the staff

about the decor the ceiling is literally spray painted black with extra holes punched in the ceiling for lights to look like stars maybe but it looks bad in the daylight the art is ok on its own honestly it just makes the whole thing look like an attempt at an avantgarde nightclub seats on the wall have tiny thin cushions to sit on and its kind of dirty there was a napkin and crumbs on the floor left by a customer who ate there and left no one cleaned it up just started moving the tables for the next guests snapping the fan on this one",0.9751,Good

highlights
great service
atmosphere
location
saw a number of group tables which looked happy
wheelchair accessible looked like it to me which is nice

extra things to consider
parking

my experiences wont really stop me from coming back we have family dinners for peoples birthdays and we manage to rotate as best as we could around restaurants in victoria so im sure someone will choose this place as a venue again

overall family members party of 9 mostly were pleased with their meal all of us was happy with the service we didnt feel forgotten or felt like we were inconveniencing them  atmosphere is always consistent and warm when you walk in the outdoor patio looks comfortable

my only complaint is the food never seems to be enough in fries ok sorry i guess potatoes are going up in price my husband ordered the strips and fries strips are always good with the honey mustard but the fries portion keeps seemingly getting smaller every year we come back my pizza was good but just good seemed more like a fancy flat bread it felt like it was alright but felt like something was missing the artichoke dip was flavourful no complaints there nicely cheesy had good consistency didnt feel like we were really saving on portions so much

since the place does get busy its good to maybe note that parking could get tricky we had to park a little further down at the residential street

again maybe im just nitpicking but ill probably be back i will just say the service is always good",0.9923,Good

service was there but quite slow we were given the bill but took a very very long time for them to come back for the pos i mean why bring the bill if youre not ready to accept payment right then and there and made to wait

we decided to go all in and opted for the church main  a whole lobster preceded by a chowder and a bowl of clams and followed by a dessert
the chowder was very smooth and creamy with teragon being the secret ingredient the clams were great with their souse

i went in blind without prior knowledge of the place despite living quite nearby and passing it frequently i entered the piatto and was almost immediately welcomed and seated  there was a friendly ambiance and familiar vibe from the moment i set foot inside the restaurant

my server marlow introduced himself and offered me the menu i looked at the various options but eventually decided to ask him for recommendations  he gladly obliged and suggested some favourites as well as something based on my preferences for something with many toppings marlow spoke passionately about each dish and eventually i settled for a simple delicious classic  the siciliana

the siciliana was served surprisingly quickly and looked beautiful at first i thought that i might not be able to finish a 10 pizza by myself but the pizza was light and refreshing with a balance of fresh veggies and evenly spread proteins every bite introduced my taste buds to fresh peppers tomatoes and basil all complemented by some light cheese if you go in expecting your typical heavy fat american pizza you might want to reconsider but if you are looking for a more authentic fresh handcrafted pizza look no further than the piatto",0.9854,Good

i ordered from door dash was hoping for a good chinese meal as a treat after a long week what i got was nothing near what i expected
i ordered the shrimp and mushroom dish kung po chicken an order of chicken chow mein and an egg roll
90 of what i ordered will not be eaten

the kung po chicken was by far the worst ive ever had it was more of a spicy raw onion soup than it was anything even resembling kung po chicken

the mushroom shrimp was alright again very watery and soupey i was able to eat some of it but it very much lacked any flavor

the chicken chow mein was basically steamed bean sprouts with very little chicken to be seen and absolutely no flavor

if not for the egg roll which was delicious this rating would have been 1 star

alas the oysters served were extremely dirty and badly presented the oysters were laid on top of one another causing the oysters below to be contaminated with the shell remnants of the oysters above them mignonette was promised alongside the lemons and cocktail sauce but unfortunately none was served
many of the oysters werent even properly removed from their base the adductor muscle the oysters had so much debris inside it was very obvious that they didnt even bother purging them soaking them for 10 mins in ice cold water so they can spit out the dirt from within
it was a filthy and grainy experience that truly took away from our love for oysters

but that is not all

the chowder oh my god we ordered the chowder right after the oysters and i was in complete shock at the state that it arrived in ill insert a video below the consistency was horrid it was far from creamy i am very very rarely offended and i felt personally insulted that the chef actually looked at these bowls and thought this was good enough to send out where are the standards it was bland the seafood inside were severely overcooked and it was the consistency of broth after voicing our dislike for the chowders they still charged us for them even though we didnt even have a second bite im absolutely mind blown 

we tipped the servers and didnt take away from anyones hard work but we didnt feel equally appreciated as customers

cashier takes my order asking me dinein or takeout no mention of the dining room closing soon a few minutes later my food comes out still no mention of the dining room closing soon  at 1105 one of the staff comes to my table and tells me the dining room closes at 11pm and i have 5 minutes i was alone so i doubt it was an excuse for something like being noisy maybe the cleaning staff just wanted to leave early and went rogue without managements knowledge

the staff is awesome theyre so warm and friendly and make you feel welcomed from the minute you open the door it was takeout service only this evening which suited us just fine but china garden would definitely be a really great place to enjoy a dinein meal

the service is polite courteous and lightening fast after placing my order i went for a short twenty minute walk around the block and by the time i returned to china garden to pick up the order it was all packaged up and waiting for me

the food is super fresh and the portions are generous there was plenty for the two of us and enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow there was plenty of plumb sweet and sour and soy sauces included if you require napkins and utensils and things of the sort just ask the staff and theyll be more than happy to try their best to accommodate you the prices are very reasonable and you get great value for your money

i believe someone said in their own review that china garden is a great endofthenight spot and thats definitely true china garden reminds me of some of the best hot spots back home in toronto that were considered a mandatory stop at the end of the night

we ordered the braised beef noodle soup dan dan noodles pan fried bao and xiao long bao

the pan fried bao and braised beef noodles though were amoung the best ive ever tried the noodles were of perfect texture chewy and complimented the rich complex beef broth perfectly

the chicken tasted like it was made from carnival food batter and the onion balls tasted like a mini donut recipe  not close at all to asian food overall i found the food overly salty covered in too much mayonnaise and lack nuances of asian cooking the food here is basically pub food

i would have rated this at 2 stars but our bartender was fantastic we were in the private room with our own bar so he didnt have all the ingredients to make the menu drinks which is odd btw he did however made me an old fashioned to suit my palate  notsosweet cinnamon syrup with mango and makers mark it was super fantasticly delicious the scotch he suggested was also on point we had it with ice on the side the bartender was super accommodating friendly and knowledgeable and if we had to the only reason we would come back to baijiu would be because of him",0.9836,Good

food was not balanced and was either completely bland or lacking salt which was not expected
and the food had repeated ingredients and taste was exactly similar between different dishes because of thatwe ordered parmigiano soup which was good but than we ordered their famous ravioli and it had exact same soup as the sauce on ravioli with very little modifications
food was tasting very fresh which was good sign but again not enough for their 5 star price point
cocktails different taste but were not balancedthe two drinks that we ordered one was over spicy and the other one overpowering peach soju
their bar has potential but dirnks were very average for 21 price tag

a significant issue was the restaurants lack of cheese a staple ingredient that resulted in a surprising number of unavailable menu items including their pizzas and nachos their dessert doughnuts as well as their cauliflower dish were also unavailable for order amoungst who knows what other dishes may have been subject to this fate this was a considerable inconvenience and quite frankly a bit absurd for a restaurant of this caliber

however the fishermans feast was a redeeming factor offering a delightful taste of the sea the mussels on the other hand were let down by a sauce that leaned towards the bitter and sour side

the staffs attitude improved over the course of the evening and the bartenders offer of a 20 gift certificate to compensate for the food issues was a commendable gesture however the explanation for the shortages  a bicycle race  seemed a poor excuse for a restaurant that should anticipate and prepare for such events

we visited this taqueria for lunch and my initial excitement was wellfounded the restaurant itself has a pleasant ambiance and is kept clean the staff members were friendly although slightly busy during our visit it seemed like they were in the midst of preparing their lunch special or something similar

while enjoying our meal we also decided to try their churros unfortunately the inside of the churros seemed slightly undercooked as the batter was still chewy

i live in toronto and unless youre willing to stand in line for hours on a weekend or manage to go on a weekday you cannot get into the oeb in liberty village so believe me when i tell you i was thrilled to discover an oeb in edmonton during a recent visit

my experience was so good on visit number one we visited again the very next day

first of all the restaurant styling and theme is impeccable truly a gorgeous space with a clearly defined brand identity

second the service is amazing on both occasions we were greeted and seated promptly and our servers on each visit were bubbly friendly knowledgable about the menu and attentive without being overbearing

im normally a sweets for breakfast kind of person but i couldnt resist the idea of a breakfast carbonara i was not disappointed with my choice the gnocchi was perfectly plush surrounded by hearty chunks of bacon and topped with a gorgeously orange fresh egg yolk every bite was perfection and i could have eaten three more servings

on visit two i reverted back to my old habits and ordered the french toast trifle another delicious choice featuring two slices of thick brioche topped with a tart lemon curd fresh strawberries and toasted meringues no need to add syrup

the only downside of my visit to oeb is that we didnt have time in our trips schedule to visit a third time

visiting edmonton and spotted the reviews for this location so took a chance

party of two we were greeted well as a walk in and promptly seated the location was busy for a saturday morning as to be expected and was well lit with refreshing colours and seating staff was very kind and friendly

the food however was mediocre to gross my partner ordered the ham with eggs sourdough bread and potatoe wedges which came as ordered and was a typical ham and egg breakfast though at an elevated price so it goes

for myself i ordered the gold digga breakfast poutine which is made up of poached eggs herb potatoes saint cyrille curds berkshire roast pork black truffles and brown butter hollandaise to the staffs credit i asked for my eggs soft and they confirmed that they would be runny what i was not expecting once the meal arrived was firstly the smaller portion size and secondly that the mix of the egg yolks whites hollandaise sauce oils and cheese would leave the bottom half of the bowl a symphonic mess of a soggy herb potatoe soup this was contrasted with the overcooked berkshire roast pork which more closely resembled last nights overcooked leftover steak cubed and refried for the nextday patrons the seasoning was present but immediately overwhelmed by the soggy potatoe soup to be rendered pointless and the truffles were simply absent all together the dish is worthy of a spot on gordan ramsays kitchen nightmares and were it not for having spent time in the army eating whatever we were told to eat im sure i would have rejected this out of hand

regardless the location was clean and the staff were great maybe well return in the future but i simply cannot recommend these breakfast poutines which appear to be constructed without care or attention to detail

the food here is fabulous and priced very very fairly the vibe is casual and unpretentious and the staff are friendly even when they are run off their feet when its busy

we wanted to try lots of dishes so as usual we ordered far more food than we could eat at one sitting

we ordered two appetizers batata mbuttana spiced minced meat between two layers of fluffy mashed potato breaded then fried and buraik think vegetarian deep fried spring roll while the buraik was very good the batata mbuttana was outrageously delicious especially when dipped in the creamy garlic sauce that accompanied the dish

we were going to order the mashweeya dip essentially a roasted veggie tapenade and the bedouin lamb soup but our server informed us that small orders of each were included with our mains so we didnt have to order separately very cool

as for the mains we ordered chicken tajeen and lamb haneeth both were outstanding

the tajeen was a halfchicken and not a small bird either that had clearly been marinated in a medley of spices then baked to perfection it was served on a generous bed of perfectly cooked yellow rice delicious

the lamb haneeth is advertised as roasted lamb in a mix of herbs creating a dish you have never seen or tasted before  and theyre right we love lamb and order it whenever the opportunity presents itself so were picky this was some of the best lamb dishes weve ever had complex rich and layered flavours accent a generous portion of meltinyourmouth tender lamb seriously if you like lamb this is a mustorder dish

as for the accompanying small plates the lamb and pasta soup was a revelation and the lentil soup was almost as good and the small plate of mashweeya dip  hummus served with a scrumptious warm bread was a creamy taste delight heck even the simple green salads were served up with a very tasty herbed olive oil dressing  so good

oh and if you like a nice strong black tea infused with fresh mint leaves order up a pot  its so delicious

all this for 95 tax and generous gratuity included great value considering the quality and the fact that our boxed leftovers provided breakfast and a light lunch the next day

aside from the service issue we started with the pigs feet which was delicious personally this is not a dish i enjoy due to the many bones but it was very authentic to the real stuff in china and the sichuan pepper flavour was spot on definitely a great choice if looking for the real deal

for the noodles i had the tomato crossing the bridge which was delicious its not spicy at all but the flavour of the booth is amazing all of the crossing the bridge noodles come with a side tray of vegetables and if you get the beef slices or other meats they come on the tray like in a hot pot i get the meatballs though instead which are really nice and they come directly in the soup the other soup we had was the fish one which again the soup was amazing

the noodles are technically all you can eat but the bowls are so large you dont really need a second bowl of noodles and they dont actually taste like anything for us its all about the broths their bubble teas are also very good but take quite a while to be made so overall its worth it just dont go if in a rush",0.9935,Good

i live in toronto and unless youre willing to stand in line for hours on a weekend or manage to go on a weekday you cannot get into the oeb in liberty village so believe me when i tell you i was thrilled to discover an oeb in edmonton during a recent visit

my experience was so good on visit number one we visited again the very next day

first of all the restaurant styling and theme is impeccable truly a gorgeous space with a clearly defined brand identity

second the service is amazing on both occasions we were greeted and seated promptly and our servers on each visit were bubbly friendly knowledgable about the menu and attentive without being overbearing

im normally a sweets for breakfast kind of person but i couldnt resist the idea of a breakfast carbonara i was not disappointed with my choice the gnocchi was perfectly plush surrounded by hearty chunks of bacon and topped with a gorgeously orange fresh egg yolk every bite was perfection and i could have eaten three more servings

on visit two i reverted back to my old habits and ordered the french toast trifle another delicious choice featuring two slices of thick brioche topped with a tart lemon curd fresh strawberries and toasted meringues no need to add syrup

the only downside of my visit to oeb is that we didnt have time in our trips schedule to visit a third time

visiting edmonton and spotted the reviews for this location so took a chance

party of two we were greeted well as a walk in and promptly seated the location was busy for a saturday morning as to be expected and was well lit with refreshing colours and seating staff was very kind and friendly

the food however was mediocre to gross my partner ordered the ham with eggs sourdough bread and potatoe wedges which came as ordered and was a typical ham and egg breakfast though at an elevated price so it goes

for myself i ordered the gold digga breakfast poutine which is made up of poached eggs herb potatoes saint cyrille curds berkshire roast pork black truffles and brown butter hollandaise to the staffs credit i asked for my eggs soft and they confirmed that they would be runny what i was not expecting once the meal arrived was firstly the smaller portion size and secondly that the mix of the egg yolks whites hollandaise sauce oils and cheese would leave the bottom half of the bowl a symphonic mess of a soggy herb potatoe soup this was contrasted with the overcooked berkshire roast pork which more closely resembled last nights overcooked leftover steak cubed and refried for the nextday patrons the seasoning was present but immediately overwhelmed by the soggy potatoe soup to be rendered pointless and the truffles were simply absent all together the dish is worthy of a spot on gordan ramsays kitchen nightmares and were it not for having spent time in the army eating whatever we were told to eat im sure i would have rejected this out of hand

regardless the location was clean and the staff were great maybe well return in the future but i simply cannot recommend these breakfast poutines which appear to be constructed without care or attention to detail

for our mains we each ordered a schnitzel i had the cordon bleu schnitzel which came out piping hot with a side of potato salad the schnitzel was super thin and had a lot of melted cheese oozing out of it when i cut into it the schnitzel was fried perfectly and came out as a nice even golden brown and also came out pretty light with very little oil sticking to the breading overall a pretty good schnitzel 810

for dessert i had an apple strudel with whipped cream and vanilla ice cream the strudel came out hot and flaky the strudel itself was not too sweet and was really good when paired with the   light and airy whipped cream you cant go wrong with ice cream on the side either

i would definitely come back for sure",0.9973,Good

my son had the chicken  sausage gumbo which was nice and hot temperaturewise and reasonable spicy i tried it and we both enjoyed it

for the main meal my son had the filet mignon yaya which is described as broiled twin medallions of beef tenderloin which is served on a red current port demiglace sauce my son said it was ok  but also above average quality it is probably just not the type of steak we are used to having for supper

i had the breaded veal panne which was veal escalopes served with pasta tossed with basil cream sauce to me the sauce needed to be a bit more of it since the pasta soaked up most of it the veal had little taste and when i asked my son it surprised him since he thought it tasted like chicken not veal it was nice but not a lot of taste

all in all it was a good meal  the gumbo was the best part of the meal the service was great she was attentive and answered all our questions we found it cold we mentioned it to her and she was able to increase the heat to make it palatable yes we would go back",0.9909,Good

upon a recent visit not much has changed the same family pictures adorn the walls the giant buddha still sits where he always has and the food is pretty much of the same standard

the thought i share is that vegetarian and vegan food has moved forward in creativity rapidly over the last decade  one visit to vancouver on the west coast will demonstrate vegetarian food of wild and passionate creativity i feel padmanadi has a lot of room for growth there

Bar Bricco,Italian,"10347 Jasper Avenue Edmonton, AB T5J 1Y7 Canada",AB,53.5407484,-113.4987221,3,"i have mixed feelings about bar bricco after dining there last night i had decided to celebrate my birthday with my boyfriend there because i enjoyed the food the last two times i came

the quality of the food was excellent  the same as i had remembered it  and our dishes arrived very quickly if you are a pasta butter and cheese lover i would highly suggest ordering the fonduta agnolotti and the egg yolk raviolo

the service was okay our server asked if we had any questions about the menu and refilled our water without being asked however she did not seem warm or personable

the atmosphere was uncomfortable for me honestly i felt like i was eating in the dark  i even had to use the flashlight from my phone to read the menu my boyfriends voice was drowned out by the music and by the laughter of the 4 girls sitting next to us by the time we finished our meal my ears were ringing i had zero desire to stay and enjoy my cocktail we were in and out of the restaurant within an hour",0.9714,Good

they were understaff with only one server but she and the owner were able to service our large group plus two other large tables with a smile grace and pride you would find in any south east asian home

shared a lot of food between 3 of us
 kimchi fried rice is pretty standard good flavour not a ton of meat but price wise its pretty decent
 bulgogi fries are amazing fries are very fresh the sauce has good depth and pairs well with the meat highly recommend this as a appetizer
 grilled pork belly was good as well when it comes to pork belly this is one of the better places ive had it the pieces are marinated and grilled well theres a good amount there as well for the price got the full size order
 they provide sides as well which include kimchi bean sprouts pickled radish and a mashed potato these pair well with some of the dishes
 bulgogi udon is pretty standard too like the kimchi fried rice nothing too special here but the noodles are cooked well and are flavourful with hints of beef
 army stew budae jjigae i love army stew and this one is pretty good as well they include instant noodles which is a nice touch good amount of meat in the mix too but wish there was more tofu
 cheese corn was alright for some reason i tasted a bit of mexican spicesflavours in there which threw me off a little
 tequila shots patron was surprisingly well priced in restsurantbar standards at 4 a shot was smooth going down too

visited el mariachi and it was great i got the enchiladas which was pretty filling it tasted pretty good as well though the chicken was a bit dry

i did also have some of the birria tacos only available on weekends and those were superb extremely hot fresh and crispy the dipping sauce was also very flavourful so id highly recommend it

i also had the carne asada tortas which i bought home and ate the next day and wow was the carne asada meat amazing extremely tasty and works well with the creaminess of the avocado

when dining in they gave some free chips with sauce the service was a bit slow but they made everything fresh

the atmosphere is also great theres so much decorations and everything just felt really unique and authentic theres also a mini store inside where you xna purchase mexican goods

i am glad we tried this place and it is now on my list of excellent places to eat and chat

ambiance
im not a fan of the big fans above each table  but i understand why they are needed as it keeps the humidity down  that much boiling liquid is bound to create humidity but the air wasnt humid  we could speak at a decent volume

the sesame sauce was pretty good  it is a good indicator if the the food is going to good

soup base
no one at the table complained  i like spicy food and the spicy base was perfect  flavorful with the right amount of heat

ordered a the three piece meal with fries and soy garlic dipping sauce

service gets five stars
hot fresh fries get five stars
coleslaw creamy with a touch of sweet gets 5 stars
fried chicken gets three stars

two of my three pieces of chicken were hot and juicy and had good crispiness drumstick and wing but the centre breast piece was a bit dry overall my main criticism is that the chicken didnt have much flavour i expected to taste the herbs and spices but it was a bit bland without the very tasty dipping sauce the chicken was underwhelming

how does the chicken stack up against other places ive tried in the edmonton area

1  mary browns chicken and taters are fabulous
2  swiss chalet when they have fried chicken available
3 coco deef fried chicken its good with quality sides but a bit bland without the dipping sauce
4jolibee salty but crispy and juicy its ok

there is a huge selection on the menu which may take several visits to try price is fair and food quality is alright cant compare to hk though

the only drawback to this place was the service they were a bit disorganized the servers seemed confused at times and we had to ask two different servers before our food finally came

bottom line dont expect the servers to be extra friendly or personal it might be a bit of a cultural shock to some but the edgy serving style is actually quite normal among most hong kong style restaurants around the world",0.3818,Bad

the service was not what it has been known for needing to order and pay for your meal prior to the service being rendered am i at a fast food restaurant now i like to be seated take my time while seated to order the food at my own pace without a lineup waiting at the door i always give a second chance but after being served the cheapest coffee having to order and pay like a fast food restaurant and the food being okay i unfortunately will not return if the coffee can become delicious again and the service can be rendered at the table only then may i consider returning",0.8946,Good

the food was very lacklustre for the price calamari was over cooked and rubbery lemon potatoes tasted like they had been cooked in vegetable stock and nothing else greek salad was fine but its hard to screw up a greek salad pork skewer was very bland and under seasoned aside from the greek salad this was the most tasteless and unappealing greek food either my sister and i have ever experienced i had to go up and ask for the bill as no one checked in on us after we received our meals staff were just standing around

Palladium Family Restaurant,Greek,"942 Cole Harbour Road Dartmouth, NS B2V 1E6 Canada",NS,44.6709796,-63.4963541,2,"hard pass on the breakfast next time for me

walked into the restaurant to be immediately greeted with the door closer hanging off the frame was seated fairly promptly and ordered a bacon  feta omelet with a poutine hollandaise home fries with toast and wife ordered a mediterranean benny daughter ordered a waffle with bacon while the restaurant was practically empty the food took forever and the server never really came back to see if we wanted our beverages topped off the other server looked over in what appeared to be concern but didnt really assist the matter

we finally get our food and the wifes benny looked quite paltry compared to similar restaurants benny meals perhaps it was the small eggs and the micro hash browns but our portions in general were on the verge of being below average

my meal had to be sent back as the poutine did not appear on my plate 7 minutes later my food reappeared as everyone else finished their food i found it extremely odd that it took that long just to put cheese on the home fries the hollandaise itself was tasty the omelet was more of a mixed western with bacon and feta but it didnt quite taste like the feta im used to at his point i didnt really care too much over the entire experience as i was starving sorry forgot to take a photo as i was ravenous by that point

daughter received a decent waffle with a side plate of bacon again kind of odd not to be on the same plate but not the end of the world we were packing up waiting for the bill when the waitress recalled she had to bring jello for the daughter but decided it was a to go thing instead of giving it to her with her meal then forgot the spoon kind of unfortunate

so sadly the entire first time experience pulled my mood down and is reflected in my review perhaps i may try the seafood lunchdinner but right not im disappointed enough that i may not just bother we had tried to get into this place one other time and the waitress tried to shove us into a tight corner where neither my wife or i could even get between the table and the chair so we walked out",-0.9615,Bad

when i arrived the restaurant was pretty empty except for one customer

i ordered a chicken souvlaki plate which on the website says that its supposed to be 1199tax for 1 skewer they charged me 1449tax the chicken skewers were barely edible since they had been mostly charred see photo and were extremely dry the fatoush salad was lackluster and the pickled turnips were also dry af my friend remarked that the pita bread looked like it had been picked up from the streets of aqraba hummus was also pretty bland in flavour  it needed more garlic for sure

Station1 Lebanese Kitchen,Syrian,"50 Tacoma Drive Dartmouth, NS B2W 3E6 Canada",NS,44.6796256,-63.5396031,5,"i dont know how anyone can give the food and service at station 1 less then 5 stars i really enjoy lebanese cuisine and have made a point to try as many places in hrm as i could back when i was on the road everyday for work that being said i have had recommendations from my middle eastern colleagues on other places in hrm to try which i have and they were good as well but cant hold a flame to station 1 we live in lower sackville and when ever we get the urge for good shawarma we always end up at station 1 and have never been disappointed in fact we used to go there before they moved to tacoma and started to get known their previous location did not get as much traffic because they were tucked at the end of a small strip mall on the corner of forest hills parkway and main street now with their improved location people are starting to notice and try them so they can get busy at times but it is worth the wait if you arrive and there is a line up

the portions are always more than fair for the price you pay comparing to other competitors the service has always been great their hummus is made from scratch and not that prepackaged grocery grade wanna be hummus the owners care about their customers and you will often find them behind the counter working to ensure a good consistent quality of food is produced they make their food with love and it shows in the flavour

if you have not tried station 1 yet you need to take a trip to tacoma plaza in dartmouth and so yourself a favour you will thank me later i have said this before to everyone i know who enjoys lebanese food and i will continue to say it that this is the best you will find in halifax hands down keep up the great work guys as always i will be back 

i confess as many times as i have eaten there i have not even thought about taking pictures all i think about is eating and enjoying their food but i will update the next time we go

update so i have been back a few more times since and still forgot to get pictures but this time my daughter reminded me 

still 5 stars as expected i would give them a higher rating if i could we also have their grape leaves and cheese rolls a try in addition to our usual chicken shawarma and they were both amazing as expected ",0.9977,Good

now i could drone on about the details far more than youd care to read but a picture is worth 1000 words i will take a moment though to advise you against ordering the wedge salad unless you think a wedge salad is bibb lettuce a boiled egg and some kind of dressing i couldnt identify if you do then definitely order the wedge salad the wise guy waiter was certain it was correct it was at that moment i realized things were not going to get better and i should enjoy the wine how this steakhouse classic could go so off the rails at a posh place like barringtons i can only guess in hindsight i should have taken a picture but wait i did promise you a picture check out whatever it was that arrived when we ordered another steakhouse classic creme brulee the over blackened top was hiding a blue surprise i have no idea what it was but it was disgusting i think what bothered me the most was that they didnt think there was anything wrong they were completely unaware of their incompetence the last time i had an experience even close to this bad was in the height of covid when you were lucky to even find a place open",0.949,Good

Aladdin,Mediterranean,"746 Bedford Highway Halifax, NS B3M 2L9 Canada",NS,44.7067907,-63.66492390000001,1,"i visited 902 restaurant earlier today and unfortunately had an extremely disappointing experience my party and i ordered meals worth around 250 and we were left with a bad taste in our mouths both figuratively and literally

first of all the ambiance was terrible it was unpleasant to look at we didnt feel comfortable or relaxed in the environment which is a key part of any dining experience there was no heating in peak winters and we were provided with a small portable heater which didnt help

the quality of the food was equally terrible it was apparent that some of the dishes were frozen and then reheated leading to a loss of flavor and texture the meat especially the beef was extremely dry and shrunk the outside was burnt while the inside was hard and rubbery the mandi rice dish was also a major disappointment not tasting or looking like real mandi rice

there were a few positives however the garlic and spicy sauce were decent but not enough to save the meal the broasted chicken looked healthy and crispy but it was unfortunately the only dish that met any standards the french fries chicken and fish all seemed to have been cooked in the same oil resulting in a strong fishy smell this was not good for members of our group who dont like the smell of fish as it interfered with the enjoyment of their meal

overall i regret visiting this restaurant and would not go there again i will be attaching photos of the dishes we received and i will leave it up to the readers to judge the quality for themselves",-0.6785,Bad

service was good

the decor is nice and the seating is pretty unique with regular tables as well as lounge style areas

parking was kind of annoying as there isnt much

the only main downside is there was a bit of a strong smell of smoke at least in the lounge area where we were sitting",0.99,Good

we started with calamari and beef bacon and blue both appetizers were cooked and seasoned to perfection

for mains we had the seafood risotto and the halibut both meals were cooked beautifully but unfortunately lacked almost any seasoning our guess is that a more junior cook had taken over the cooking and was tentative about using salt and pepper we asked and they brought us two grinders which helped tremendously

we would have liked to enjoy a dessert and some he finish of our meal but our new server came with the billwithout an offer of even a coffee when we asked about dessert she said i can see if i can find a cook to come back and do something for you

we passed on the offer disappointing way to end a wonderful time so the tale of two servers one great and one that didnt really care

it is a fairly small restaurant and seemed very popular as it was packed but after a wait we were able to get a table the menu was fairly large so it was hard for me to choose what to have a good problem i eventually opted for the lamb shank biryani with chilly garlic naan i thought the food tasted excellent and it was extremely filling i could barely finish the meal despite finding it to be delicious the price was very reasonable for what you got

the staff were very helpful in helping us out as one of us had a food allergy so they took particular care in helping him find a dish that he could eat safely

we chose bar seats right in front of the open tiny kitchen and enjoyed chatting with the cooks during service everyone  the bartender the hosts and the cooks were personable fun and attentive

the drinks were inventive and well balanced exactly what id expect from an eclectic bar on queen west in toronto but much closer to home food came out at a reasonable pace which considering the size of the kitchen three cooks in something smaller than apartment kitchens ive had before a single 30 induction range is impressive id say we made a mistake doing 6 of the larger plates between two people but we managed to down it all everything was well balanced and approachable with a huge focus put on texture  incredibly well thought out from that standpoint

food we started with the bread and mussels best mussels weve ever had as they were cooked perfectly and fresh and the broth was heaven the bread pairing was perfect to soak up all the buttery broth goodness next was the shrimp bao the bread was fluffy and light and shrimp was at chilled room temperature perfect for a summer day a good flavour of celery in case you dislike that but id still suggest you try it finally we had the zucchini and beef tartare zucchini didnt wow though still fresh and summer minty vibes beef tartarehands down best weve ever had the asian fusion incorporated was perfect closed it out with a strawberry  cream which albeit simpler was well done

drinks go for them all very creative and they can walk you through tasting notes perfectly milk punch method not actually milk recommend strawberry basil negroni strongly recommend not traditional negroni alcohol forward eucalyptus sour subtle calm and collected recommend corn star be adventurous as the chipotle is super subtle worth the risk recommend vesper again not alcohol forward recommend

toppings there are multiple options of toppings and you can change your toppings with the other available toppings just in case of you dont like any toppings like we replaced the top oh my veggies pizza from olives  jalape√±o and mushrooms pine apples

Heng Fung Restaurant,Chinese,"179 Wyse Road Dartmouth, NS B3A Canada",NS,44.6725401,-63.5824532,1,"honestly have nothing good to say the number of decent reviews is astonishing i dont like to hate on businesses especially on local ones but i also want to help others make informed decisions on where theyre going to spend their money and what theyre going to eat

i ordered takeout by phone someone answered the phone hurriedly said they would put me on hold and then proceeded to just leave me on the line without actually putting me on hold so i could hear everyone talking in the kitchen but had no idea when i would actually be helped finally i was served by someone and she was nice enough but then as soon as i was done going through the order she abruptly said bye without asking me my name for the pickup or giving me an estimation for when it would be ready she didnt actually hang up so i was once again just left sitting on the other end of the line but no one was there to listen to my questions

finally got our food and while the portion sizes were enormous the food itself was just horribly bland it looked like it had sauce on it but somehow there was literally no flavour basically eating super greasy food without any good taste experience to make up for it also i ordered the eggplant off of the vegetable section of the menu assuming it was vegetarian and it was full of beef i get that this was partially my fault for not double checking but putting a meat dish under the vegetable section and not indicating anywhere that there is meat in it is just horrible business protocol

on the whole this experience was bad enough for me to never return",-0.8964,Bad

time to get the order it was really fast beyond expectations
cleanliness  from my experience  the space is cleanliness is within expectations

i order a 16 donair pizza

what i liked was the pizza was huge and weighed a lot love the big pieces of donair chunks and they werent shy with the cheese and donair meat
i loved that the donair sauce came on the side  not being on the pizza it self made the pizza easy to cut without it being sloppy love the idea


what i didnt like was there a inch and a half of the donair meat not covered by cheese making it very dry
looking at the pizza wen first opened cheese topping could of been a bite more cooked and spread out more to the sides of the pizza as there was about a inch and a half of donair meat not covered making it very dry and could of added a bite more tomatos on top
for the crust pizza was over cooked on the bottom and had to cut with a streak knife it was very hard to go true crust but inside of pizza crust wasnt cooked and looked like raw dough",0.9784,Good

first off fish tacos were so good fish was perfectly fried in a crispy batter with great toppings
pork taco was loaded but lacked a wow factor looked good and was filling and juicy though
chicken wings were dryovercooked and the flavour wasnt great reminded me of a cold chinese fried fish dishalso might be a me thing but i wouldnt get it again
nachos were yummy but basic so i felt like the price was a bit high chips were very fresh and crunchy
pork belly bao was yummy but lacked a fresh flavour like cilantro or pickled veg might be a personal preference but the pork belly was yummy and the bao was fantastic

we ordered the classic margarita and i thought it was great i usually hate tequila but im trying to open up and try it again and the agua de jamaica wasnt my jam but that might be a me thing

female asian server was great so nice and helpful but there was the grumpiest looking white female server that might be in the wrong profession i felt intimidated whenever she glanced at our table she brought out our nachos and practically rolled her eyes while adding another table to ours i told her to leave nachos on the bench table was full beside me no biggie just big frowns the whole time we were there

however it is just not for me

i have seen better french cuisine restaurant with a larger menu and product that are just as fresh and local even if its about the same price i would still prefer the one with larger menu

the waiting time is quite dreadful i understand that it is a smaller sized restaurant but waiting for an hour and 15 minutes isnt exactly ideal for the food quality received food was okay fries were extremely salty

have to give credits to the waiters for refilling our cup every 10 minutes so the service is really up on another level

the booking has to be made too much in advance in order to guarantee a spot this is due to the fact that the restaurant is very small and has a very large title under its belt

maybe the place is really the most astonishing place to visit or maybe my brokeneess has limited my vision towards fancy restaurant and made me unable to understand the reaction by most people but i would say that it is definitely a restaurant that you would go for once or twice in a lifetime not more unfortunately",0.9357,Good

its a cute little place that has an open chicken

when we walked in you can instantly see the interaction between the employees which i loved they were calling out of each other when a customer was coming in or leaving and also when it came to food

the service was good we ordered and the food came in pretty fast

we ordered miso soup seaweed and tofu salad veggie dumplings udon carbonara and the salmon tataki

this is a tapas restaurant so the portions arent huge

my favorite was the udon carbonara is was creamy but not to heavy and also the veggie dumplings

the seaweed and tofu salad was not that good there was barely any seaweed or even dressing in the salad it was mostly mixed greens
and the salmon tataki was a tease there was only 4 pieces that we shared

we didnt get any drinks so i cannot comment on that

i strongly recommend this place for birthdays because of its festive atmosphere and the warm hospitality of the staff they give one small matcha cheesecake for the birthday person so if you want to have something for the whole group you can also order the assorted dessert in extra

my favourite among appetizers is the sashimi salad and among tapas the tokyo calamari for the noodles the stirfried beef udon is very good and is not too salty and for the sizzling stone rice bowl the curry cheese smells extremely good and can be smelled meters away i wish however they didnt get rid of the pork tonkatsu curry on the menu

however over the past 5 to 6 years ive observed some noticeable changes in the level of customer service and the overall layout of the restaurant it seems that the owners have missed an opportunity to enhance their profits by not considering the logistical aspects of the establishment theres room for improvement in this regard

one of the major changes i noticed is the declining level of customer service the staff appears to lack the same level of care and dedication they once had during a recent visit i brought some friends to experience the authentic haitian cuisine unfortunately i encountered an unpleasant situation when i had to return to the front cashier to make a change to my order despite clearly specifying my desired rice type the staff in the kitchen were rude and insisted that it wasnt on the receipt instructing me to go back to the front to pay for it this encounter left a sour taste in my mouth

furthermore upon reaching home and indulging in my meal i noticed a decline in the quality of the food particularly the beef as a lover of the legume ive been consistently disappointed by the dish at this restaurant in recent times

i truly hope the owners take note of these customer concerns and consider making changes to enhance the overall experience it would be wonderful if they paid attention to reviews like these i believe there are customers like myself who long for a return to the delicious food and enjoyable dining experience that this restaurant once offered",0.9905,Good

we came during lunchtime we ordered the hamburgers they are so good the buttery brioche bun topped with an amazing smokey caramelized onion and well seasoned beef patty perfectly encapsulated the combination of sweet and salty the density of the burger felt perfectly balanced all throughout although i believe the mayonnaise sauce served with the fries was too dense and did not compliment the lightness of the burger

unfortunately i could not take a picture of the burger as the lighting present with my phone was too bad

firstly when we walked in we were so happy with the ambienceatmosphere of this restaurant the decor music and layout were lovely

second this was our first time trying russian cuisine and i personally wasnt sure about what i was reading about on the menu after ordering i realized they have pictures of all their meals on their website in the gallery section i highly recommend to go take a look if you also are unfamiliar with russian cuisine

furthermore i am so pleased to say that the food was delicious generous portions flavourful and truly satisfying plus the bread butter and sour cream were all homemade im sure more was homemade but this is what we specifically found out was homemade ill post photos of what my husband and i got for reference

service is top shelf
portions are very generous
baton rouge has a rather unique system whereby the wait staff are constantly attempting to be aware of each others tables  what this means for the customer is fast efficient service  if your meal is up in the kitchen and your server is not there but another is  that server will bring it out to you  simple things like water refills and clearing dishes is rarely missed
for starters we had the calamari  it was cooked to perfection tender and crispy on the outside served with smoke show aioli the seared ahi tuna salad the tuna was meltinyourmouth delectable
the new york strip loin ordered rare was incredible
we also went overboard by adding a side of sizzling shrimp and scallops
the waitress maria was quick to ask if i wanted the steak off the regular menu  or the special upgrade that came with starter salad and the steak was topped with a generous slice of brie and pan seared mushrooms and accompanied with green beans and choice of second side
our meal was capped off with the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake to share

the fries are standard size home made and crispy the cole slaw on point  tartar sauce was sweeter than expected still very good not knocking it and really enjoyed the dill sauce not as sweet and very dilly
we did not try the deserts maybe next time
note the place doesnt look like much but dont be put off by the location or aesthetics the food is an epicureans dream

theres no reservations and the place is very small they give you a number and you wait until they call you we waited for about 30 mins and we were seated

the place is very small that the tables are all so close to each other you can clearly hear other ppls conservation its very loud and theres also alot of families with kids

if you are looking to go somewhere quit to eat brunch this is not the place to go

when you seat down they give you tea the tea wasnt to my liking at all
they dont offer glasses of water so we got bottle of water

they also give you complimentary plate of olives turnip cucumber and tomatoes

we ordered the spicy cheese and zahtaar sage that was very good i think it was my favorite it was very big and came on a board

the food was okay we had nachos and calamari that we shared for appetizers and for my main meal i had the filet mignon with peppercorn sauce accompanied with salmon tartare mashed potatoes and vegetables
the nachos were good
the calamari was good but everyone that had some felt sick by the end of the night
the filet mignon was ok not a lot of flavor and even with the peppercorn sauce it was still ok
the salmon tartare was good and fresh maybe a little more seasoning but overall id have it again
the mashed potatoes were a little bland to my taste but was good with the peppercorn sauce

for the service they had multiple big groups that night so it could effect this but for our group we were over 20 and had only one server they never came to check for water or that everyone had only at the end did we get more after asking we had drinks the drinks were good in the beginning as well but they never came back to ask if we wanted more i never had a set of utensils and had to grab from another table this could be a mix up with a big group the server was nice and handled multiple groups hence why i cant blame her but they could have added more servers she had two big groups in all that so of course some things will be missing

where do i even begin first off we were here thanks to a giveaway that i had initial won through a certain platform entr√©e main meal and dessert was on the house for two

from the moment we entered the restaurant we were greated right away they already knew why we were there which was great i didnt have to explain myself and show proof and have to go through a long series of waiting for an authorisation from the owner the staffs were all well informed about everything

we were seated right away they took the time to explain the menu and informed us about the specials of the evening our waitresshostess was a little cold by mid meal meaning she did not took a moment to ask if everything was to our liking while on the other hand a table next to us were regular costumers and i will say they were treated firstclass mind you we ordered extra items two cocktails and tip was given according to our entire meal including the extra items

despite that little hiccup our dinner experince at bistro nolah was by far the best we have ever had in a very long time

i have always wanted to try southern dishes without having to travel too far and let me tell you the food was mouthwatering it was an explosion of flavors the details on each plating was immaculate

the whole experince was so memorable that we came back a second time not long after

Boucherie Abu Elias,Middle Eastern,"733 Boulevard de La Cote-Vertu Saint-Laurent, QC H4L 1Y3 Canada",QC,45.521061,-73.6742542,1,"review of abou elias restaurant

i recently had the opportunity to visit abou elias restaurant and unfortunately i left with a rather disappointing experience while i had heard positive things about their sandwiches and service my personal encounter was far from satisfying

one of the first things i noticed was the size of the sandwiches they were incredibly tiny which left me feeling a bit shortchanged it seemed like there was barely any filling making the overall taste and satisfaction quite underwhelming

to make matters worse the meat in the sandwiches was extremely chewy it felt like it had been overcooked or lacked tenderness this greatly affected the overall enjoyment of the meal as i had expected a better quality of meat

moreover the service i received when requesting a bit of garlic sauce on the side was quite disappointing the employee seemed irritated by the request and proceeded to lecture us about their policy of not providing additional condiments their attitude was unprofessional and left a negative impression it is disheartening when a customers reasonable request is met with such hostility

the most disappointing aspect was the stark contrast between the restaurants online presence and the actual experience while they may portray themselves as generous and offering amazing service on various youtube channels the reality was far from it it felt as if they were merely pretending to provide exceptional service for the sake of online appearances

overall my visit to abou elias restaurant was far from satisfactory the sandwiches were tiny the meat was chewy and the service was below par i would advise potential customers to approach this establishment with caution as the actual experience may not align with the advertised image",0.701,Good

also please give a try to their hummus this is what real hummus should taste like this is the only place ive tried  that serve a proper hummus in montreal and trust me ive tried many lebanese restaurants on the island and in laval for the past 10 years this would be considered a good hummus even in lebanon it is creamy and you can really taste the tahini

the food was decent but nothing special  some of the meat was tender and some was chewy  the shrimp were tasty but not very big  the best thing that we ate was the spicy fried chicken  it was crisp flavourful and juicy  it would have been nice to have more dipping sauces for the largely unflavoured meats  the kimchi was also very nice and not overly spicy

the restaurant is fun since you grill your own food to the doneness that you prefer but once the novelty wears off you realize that you are paying to cook your own meal in a restaurant

my main concerns was more of a food safety issue  you are given tongs to grill the raw meat but you use the same tongs to serve the cooked meat and the side dishes thereby contaminating everything  im not usually a stickler about these things but in this case you are cooking many different pieces of meat at many different stages of doneness and everything is contaminated",0.9748,Good

we ordered drinks aperol spritz was well made cold and refreshing the cucumber basil gimlet was stellar cucumberbasil were a perfect match for the gin and citrus ingredients gave lively sweetsour notes served on rocks it was a welcome aperitif for a warm humid evening
appetizers were shared the korean kimchee dumplings were delicious beautifully thin wrappers with pork and kimchee filling steamed and served with a soysesame dipping sauce the giant calamari crown was a whole calamari tube sliced into rings delicately breaded and fried  tender tasty served with one of the best aiolis ive ever had  smoky savoury slightly spicy with an herbaceous note i couldnt identify but really enjoyed crab cakes were homemade with a nice crust pan fried and served with chipotle remoulade good texture and taste bruschetta was good the tomato topping was fresh and tangy my only issue is that i prefer the baguette slices toasted or grilled and these were served au naturel not my personal taste
mains were the double cut pork chop stuffed with brie pecans and dried cranberries big appetite at the table the chicken supreme with maple mustard glaze for the smallest appetite the pork chop was nicely seared tender juicy served with a port reduction the chicken was cooked perfectly on the bone the glaze skewed more to being a sauce but it was quite delicious more savoury than sweet well balanced both were served with roasted baby potatoes that were creamy inside and seasonal fresh vegetables cooked tender crisp also tasty myself and the other member of our party ordered the fish special pan fried salmon filet with pineapple and apple salsa seved with pecan fried rice and the fresh summer veg the salmon filet was cooked perfectly seared outside moist and tender inside the salsa was a fresh tangy note that complimented the rich salmon pecan fried rice was astounding a seemingly odd combination that was extremely yummy we ate every bit of it
for dessert the large appetite had a creme brulee the rest of us ordered one each of the three available desserts to share creme brulee was nice the custard was smooth silky with perfect texture the sugar crust torched to a golden brown that cracked satisfyingly when struck with the spoon it was a hit with the creme brulee lovers at the table the lemon tart had a light fresh filling topped with 3 individual meringues lending a nice textural element the crust was on the thick side and very difficult to cut into with the spoon but the flavours were there the absolute stand out was the chocolate torte dark rich decadent sweet and bitter notes of the chocolate perfectly balancedso good
our server tegan was excellent friendly and personable
we had 2 cocktails a beer 9 glasses of wine couldnt agree on bottles 4 appies 4 mains and 4 desserts the bill after tax and before tip was 434 we left stuffed and extremely happy 5 stars highly recommendwill eat here again next time im in town

they placed us at a wiggly table and we felt completely ignored the evening wasnt that busy and there were a couple of empty tables when we asked if we could change our table after a couple finished to get a better view the waitress came back and told us that the manager said it was booked yet we stayed past 9pm and no one came to claim the table however  one couple did come and surprisingly they changed their table three times so basically from what i gather is if you are a regular and an important personal youll get the highend golden treatment if not you are treated with rudeness
as for the food  it is overpriced and nothing to crave about any good food critic would give them nothing higher than one star if you are looking for something with flavor id recommend an ordinary pub such as taverna or the pizza restaurant famoso

we threw the hostess off a bit as my friend was wearing a large brimmed hat for her gothic halloween costume and i was wearing a pumpkin shirt and leggings with pumpkins on them she complimented us on our costumes and my friend looked at her with a straight face and said what costumes this is our everyday wear the hostess had a look of horror on her face until we started laughing and said just kidding and then she laughed as well

several items on the menu which were recommended to us by the server were not available  our party and the server only become aware after the order was placed   this implies poor communication with management when items listed as specials several drink specials as well as common items like onion rings were not longer available

also we sat in the patio area at the top of the restaurant and even though we dont expect cleanliness to be a top priority for outdoor seating the quality in this case was terrible   many of the tables and chairs were covered in bird droppings with no attempt made to clean them  we managed to move things around sufficiently to find a clean area for our group but we were surprised there was no attempt made by canadian brewhouse staff to assist

the second is about the cake i purchased which consists of a dozen macarons a pitasschio and a fruit tart as shown below they all have the same flaw in my opinion and taste the cream in the cake is too sweet and very sweet it was too sweet for me to eat any longer by definition macarons are sweet but in terms of taste the flavours i purchased are nothing special except for chocolate because chocolate flavour is the flavour that shows its taste most clearly and accurately

we ordered 3 appetizers and a main each the apps were wonton nachos bacon wrapped buffalo chicken stuffed jalape√±o poppers and spicy shrimp the food looked amazing and tasted amazing but the portions were a little underwhelming especially the shrimp 6 shrimp with sauce for 18 seems a little steep but as i said the flavor was fantastic the apps took long to come out as the had originally burned our nachos and the ones we received seem to be overcooked still it also had a lot of pulled pork and toppings under the wontons so it was basically half and half toppings to wontons

we both ordered burgers i got the pierogi burger and she got the geraldine hot honey southern fried chicken burger they both cane with fries and spicy ketchup which was awesome really enjoyed the spicy ketchup my pierogi burger was pretty good burger patty was a little overcooked but still juicy and well seasoned her burger was a little less impressive it came with coleslaw which was large chunks of cabbage which had a bitter taste the batter on the chicken wasnt that good either but the sauce was the best part she didnt even finish half of it due to the coleslaw tasting so bad hers meal was 24 and mine was 23

my family and i were celebrating a birthday  early mothers day we ordered a fair amount of food or server was very sweet and helpful when we ran in to food issues so 4 stars for that only issue it was not 5 is because service includes the kitchen in my eyes

drinks
elderflower fields martini  sweet elderflower does come through 55
cesar  classic cesar its good 45
i forget the name but its the spicy margarita on the menu  really nice refreshing wish there was more of a salt rim 45

apps
mussles  plump but over cooked not much broth and underseasoned
wings  i actually really liked the breaded wings i thought they were 55
pork belly  kinda funny but maybe a bit too honest our server apologized for the wait on this dish due to the fact that the chef slipped and dropped our original pork belly on the floor she quickly offered a discount on our meal and it came out maybe 7 mins later

mains
seafood risotto 
came with mussles scallops and shrimp i believe my dad had it and the read was average not over done but nothing to make you want to order it again

cod with beet salad 
my mom raved about this dish she was it was excellent

steak
unfortunately my brothers steak was over cooked again our server noticed without us having to say anything this was due to her own experience cooking at home she visually saw the cook was over following this she offered to have another one made or give us a discount my brother opted to keep the one made already due to food waste and time the garnish and flavours on this dish were very delicious

salmon with beet salad
when i got the plate i realized i am particular about salmon and probably should of asked more questions the salmon was over cooked and the skin was kinda soft which i personally really like salmon skin crispy or with a hard sear maybe it was just personal preferance but i really didnt like the cook on it the fish was just not handled well again simular to the steak the cook not on par but the flavours of the sauce and seasoning were greatthe beet salad on the side was a vanilla dressing with goat cheese

dessert
baklava 55 so good made with walnuts and you can tell its a home recipe

overall

i think the place can do really well as a relaxed seafood restaurant i think the pub food options are awesome for students to get some food before going out theres a wonderful atmosphere with the arches and long tables thay give a cozy casual feel i also would tell anyone that the wings are good the only downfall is the price for what you get i wouldnt want to pay for food overcooked or not paid attention too i think sorting out a clear focus on what kind of restaurant this is now will help an updated about us online will bring in more people in the upcoming summer season for tourists now a days online presence is so important im excited to go back with a few friends and try more of the pub food when i get around to it",0.9983,Good

their lunch special is good value for money we sat down for a quick lunch on a weekend the space is clean and well kept

we started with the takoyaki which was mostly batter and one small piece of octopus in each ball i wouldnt order these again

their lunch specials range from 1620 and come with a main rice miso soup and side dishes we chose the steak lunch which was a nice variety of flavours the steak could have been better as it was a bit chewy but for the price not a bad deal if we visit again id like to try one of the cuts from their regular menu

the slight disappointment here was the service the host and server were pleasant but the service was quite slow and no one checked on us i had to get up once to go ask for chopsticks and again to ask for the bill

overall its fairly good value if youre hungry",0.9496,Good

the wagyu don i had asked for was good without being great with the cook being just about there and a dish that couldve always done with a little more meat sadly across the table the sirloin was tough and barely rare and needed 2 hotplates to get it to a consistent rare to consume comfortably

supposing this is a oneoff i would be willing to give them another try down the line with the recommendation to introduce thicker hot plates that would allow the dish to remain warm for longer and even cover for any cooking inconsistencies",0.7424,Good

Megumi Mazesoba,Japanese,"46 Saint Clair Avenue E Toronto, ON M4T 1M9 Canada",ON,43.6887264,-79.3919129,5,"megumi mazesoba opened up in my neighbourhood two months ago and i had been meaning to check it out soonerboy i wish i did

i went with a friend of mine who had been raving about it and the owner paula  and the moment we walked in i could understand why the warmth and familiarity with which we were greeted instantly made us feel at home

it was lunchtime on a friday and i would say it was more than 50 occupied we picked a table perpendicular from the long row of tables along the far wall i would say that while we were there it only got busier  both with dinein patrons and people coming in to pick their takeaway orders up all the more impressive that there were only two visible employees working  paula who worked the floor with her hospitality and also somehow managed to assist with the dish preparations and another gentleman

my friend and i both ordered the megumi mazesoba  hers with no spice while i got the signature spicy which is a midtier spice level man  i can handle my spices and this was definitely a fragrant pungent sharp and delicious spiciness they dont mess around

we both got our bowls with udon noodles they were perfectly cooked  warm supple bouncy and mixed together with the pork lard ajitama egg and all the other ingredients it was a flavour bomb in my mouth soooooo good

do not finish all the sauce at the bottom of the bowl  i made this mistake because it was just too yummy to resist but you are supposed to save a bit of it to eat with rice at the end thankfully my friend hadnt hoovered her food down like i did so she spared some of her sauce for me and i got to enjoy those last few bites that are meant to be mixed with the rice

i am still dreaming about this mazesoba

for dessert paula brought out little sample portions of the banana cigar dish served with ice cream it is like a banana spring roll very simple and delightful and a nice sweet finish to a meal filled with so much savouriness

it is so great to finally have a good asian noodle restaurant option in this neighbourhood

the main reason this restaurant receives a 15 is because of poor customer service our server was quite rude to our party of 8 when we asked about specials he curtly replied that he would prefer to wait to go over specials until the remaining two people show up so he doesnt have to repeat the specials twice sure makes sense but also is it that difficult to present the specials twice one person in our party asked for some salt and he replied that he was still going around with the pepper and would get to it after he could just say sure no problem it was just the tone and choice of words there was always some explanation that we found extremely patronizing not to mention he lectured my partner about how an old fashion drink is actually made when we just asked for a large ice cube and not small crushed ones im not sure if our server was just in a grumpy mood but it sure did rub off on our table and frankly that kind of patronizing attitude is just not acceptable at a restaurant in yorkville charging 100 a head

ive lived in the area most of my life and have always felt the area was lacking when it came to restaurant options even in regards to take out i probably have driven past new orleans seafood  steakhouse hundreds of times coming home and never noticed it until i saw it pop up on google maps when looking for cajun restaurants in toronto boy am i happy it did because this has become easily the best restaurant in the area when factoring everything

first the location and service the location is a lacking point as the restaurant itself is very small and probably fits less than 30 people max although its size it doesnt get too loud in the restaurant and the interior design is very formal and  has a hint of new orleans culture as for service the family running this restaurant are incredibly kind and welcoming the person i presume to be the owner was around making jokes with patrons and checking in on all of us ensuring our glasses are full and all requests are answered

now onto the food man does this place hit the spot ive wanted to try cajun food for years but never thought a place like this would be so close to home we started our meal with the crab cakes that do come in a serving of two

without asking we were presented our crab cakes on separate plates perfectly plated for myself and my date fried to perfection tender inside but not mushy accompanied by a bouquet of fresh veggies this was a great start to the meal alongside the complimentary bread

onto our main dish there were a couple options on the menu i wanted to try but i felt jambalaya had to be my first deep dive into cajun food this dish although being priced highly is a hefty portion and easily feeds 23 people the rice the sausages the various seafood all of it was just amazing and fulfilled all my expectations and maybe even exceeded them

the food at insomnia lounge was enjoyable but the wait time for our dishes left something to be desired it would have been nice to see the kitchen keep up with the bustling atmosphere of the lounge

one of the standout features of the establishment was the lighting which was truly exceptional and added a unique touch to the ambiance however the decor in the back of the restaurant could use some updating particularly the odd red sofa chairs that seemed out of place with the overall aesthetic

despite some positives the negatives of my experience at insomnia lounge have led me to the decision not to return while the staff was mostly pleasant and the lighting was a highlight the presumptuous server and lengthy wait times for food detracted from the overall experience additionally the decor in certain areas could benefit from an upgrade to better align with the vibe of the rest of the lounge

 shrimp and lobster roll 45 the bread was perfectly soft and toasted the lobster tasted fresh
 pancakes 55 the pancakes were the highlight for me they were so soft and fluffy and served warmed  they were great
 stock burger 455 the meat was unreal  one of the best burgers at a restaurant we ever had knock 5 because it doesnt come with a side

the service was commendable  the servers were exceptionally friendly and attentive throughout our meal adding a positive touch to the overall dining experience

we decided to try their popular chicken tenders and fish and chips while the chicken tenders seemed to be a crowdfavorite we were slightly disappointed by the dryness of the chicken though they provided some sauce on the side the tenders inherent dryness made it a bit difficult to enjoy fully however on the flip side the fish and chips truly stood out the portion size was more than generous offering two servings of deliciously crispy fried fish the fish itself was cooked to perfection  crunchy on the outside while the flesh remained tender and flavorful on the inside the accompanying portion of chips was excellent adding a delightful touch to the overall dish

one noteworthy aspect of this restaurant is their enticing happy hour deal available from 3 pm to 5 pm and 8 pm until closing time regrettably we visited during dinner hours and consequently we missed out on these attractive deals nevertheless the ample portion sizes of the meals made up for it leaving us feeling satisfied and content with the value we received

we chose the seasonal creme brulee which we were told was just vanilla flavoured and not really seasonal unless vanilla is a summer seasonal flavour which he really enjoyed and the apple pie jar pretty standard desserts not gonna lie i was kinda full at this point and didnt eat much of it

they really have mastered the art quite well as each dish stimulates all five of your senses individually each course itself is a work of art in its own right the textures of each dish work well individually and together feel like a harmonious symphony that doesnt overpower you i must give kudos to their house made sesame tofu the texture of that dish was a personal favourite of mine their steamed dish also whetted your appetite as when you uncover it the balance of the vegetables and red snapper emit a delicate scent that is is a stark contrast with the umami of the mingled broth formed at the bottom needless to say each dish was absolutely delicious and inventive the chef has not only mastered his art but showcases how well thought out his combinations of seasonal ingredients are the pairings of each dish and how they prepare them prove its michelin status

vibrant eatery hidden in the interiors of midtown they have huge place no shortage of seating but we always fancy the patio  rooftop getting to the washroom is a bit of inconvinience as its located deep down in the basement cheerful atmosphere and the place is always packed

cocktails are one of the best and they also have a good collection of beers and serve seasonal local brews too food is average and can get better rotating menu and
also more veganvegetarian options
service has been up and down but just about there in general

size delicious food and the right size not too big and not too small

generous portion sizes for the price and great balance of flavours  i could easily share or have enough left over for another meal the lamb skewer was tender and moist while the lamb stew had a good amount of bitesized lamb and aromatic and flavourful rice while i would order a skewer or stew dish again the dessert pastry roll seemed smaller than expected compared to the mains and couldve had more pistachio taste",0.9682,Good

for seafood lovers look no further as pearl diver features a wide array of freshly shucked oysters all across the nation and a wider array of malted beverages to wash them down i had the oysters from pei with the mignoette sauces alongside hot mustard and they were divine i had a thre grilled sea bream and my friend dined on the  fish and chipsi wasnt particularly attached to my sea bream but that is no bearing on the chef sea bream is encased with bones but which fish isnt my friends entree had me salivating for more

the food is alright honestly as far as fried chicken sandwiches go there is a lot of competition in this area putting out a better product for less the cuban was good but again why is it 15tax for just a sandwich i will echo another review here and say this is beyond inflation i went during peak times and the place was empty it has potential i want to like this place

i went here twice really wanted to find a reliable sandwich shop in the village the atmosphere is actually nice beers in the fridge could be way more popular if prices were lower

sadly i wont be returning a third time too expensive for a quick lunch not as substantial as a dinner elsewhere at the same price

to the owners if you read this i suggest either increasing the quality of your chicken including a soft drink if youre going to charge 11 for a side or overall just lowering your prices even a dollar or two i would go once a week if i could get a cuban sandwich small fry and can of coke for 18 or 25 with a beer",0.643,Good

four stars due to reasonable criticism first portions are tiny and i didnt feel satisfied with the dish and second the problem is that the menu is limited there should be a broader spectrum of dutch dishes for example notorious pannenkoek was not on the menu for desserts there is only one option

overall it was a great experience and i would come back again and recommend it as an introduction to dutch cuisine",0.6876,Good
Borrel,Modern European,"1333 Danforth Avenue Toronto, ON M4J 1N1 Canada",ON,43.6819544,-79.3290184,3,"i came here once for genever once for rijsttafel and finally here just for dinner

i really wish it was better the flavours just dont cut it for indonesian food we had a lot of indo food in amsterdam including rijsttafel a bunch of times at various places this was as good as the worst place we tried there i do recall precovid the rijsttafel here being disappointing but this city is incredibly limited for this food so i was just grateful to have it at all

this time as nice as the staff are they cant make up for the poorly flavoured food the satays were edible but not good tasteless just some overcooked chicken skewers the nasi goreng was bitter and bland and the plate was just ugly and brown not even a cucumber for colour and where was the egg

the bitterballen were actually perfect i dont know why i ordered them though because i didnt really get the hype about them in netherlands so i dont know why i thought that would change ill say borrels are almost identical to the ones we had in the hague so they do succeed there very authentic

the fries were just terrible they tasted and felt like they had been fried cooled and refried about 10 times and then sat out all night under the headlamp rock hard and full of grease and didnt even taste good we had loads of dutch fries in our visits and to say these are anything like the ones there is not even reasonable i dont really know what to make of it if they cant make good fries

its hard to find good indomalay food in toronto so i appreciate borrel trying by doing not only the white dutch food but also the netherlands great indonesian cuisine culture i just think there are other restaurants in toronto that do indo flavours so much better

also if you havent had genever do it when youre here it is almost impossible to find in ontario and its not available in any lcbo or any other toronto bar as far as i know i have to give kudos to borrel for going through all the trouble of bringing this spirit to us

i think it seems like the dutch food is generally welldone so if i ever do return ill just stick to that and genever and go elsewhere for indonesian food",0.9908,Good

the food was traditionally italian and of a super high quality and beautifully laid out  plates of bruschetta for starters and then several platters of seafood and antipasti were brought to each of the 7 group tables

for the pasta course cannelloni which my brother said was among the best he had ever eaten  i am severely gluten intolerant so they customized a penne plate for me with lots of veggies  delicious

then came a choice of osso bucco or salmon or a vegetarian plate  i chose the salmon which was a huge and perfect portion with lovely mango and baby tomato bits as a sauce  it was perfectly seared served alongside baby carrots and grilled asparagus  bottled flat and sparkling water was served alongside choices of wine

for dessert we had a customized gluten free wedding cake delivered and they placed it on a dedicated table in the corner of the room near the light  beautiful  servers sliced and plated it at no extra charge  guests also ordered digestifs our table had amaretto with large orange slices  wow

everything was brilliant and service was impeccable  wine and water glasses were refilled and plates were cleared at a comfortable pace  staff was super professional and chatted with us in a friendly manner

we got there right before the rush at 6pm so id recommend to go around that time or you might have to wait

each meat comes in 200g worth and id say thats about one portion but i also shared some seafood pancake and ate rice with it so id say a minimum of 30 of food per person to get full

this plays is famous for their infinite corn cheese so take good advantage of that you can always ask for more side dishes and if youre someone like me who likes kimchi at kbbq you can ask for extra

yummy korean restaurant is an institution of toronto like swatow and manpuku 

one thing i would suggest is to update a small portion of the tables to be 2tops so the flow of customers especially solo diners and couples can be managed more effectively

another thing is that i will recommend servers to ask about drinks orders or at least mention both alcoholic and nonalcoholic options this should help boost drink sales

taos chicken fried rice danced on our palates a whirlwind of flavors that united smoky caramelized notes with the tangy sweetness of pineapple the lemon chicken was a true masterpiece as if da vinci himself had crafted the dish tender succulent pieces of chicken were lightly battered then bathed in a vibrant lemon sauce that dazzled the senses with its perfect balance of sweetness and acidity

the pepper beef left us utterly speechless with its tender morsels of beef that melted in our mouths juxtaposed against the fiery heat of black pepper and the delicate sweetness of caramelized onions the assorted seafood  vegetables was a delightful marine medley harmoniously combining the briny freshness of the ocean with the natural sweetness of colorful crisp veggies

as for the chicken singapore vermicelli it was a tantalizing fusion of textures and flavors each strand of vermicelli expertly coated in a fragrant curry sauce that bewitched the senses

our adventure culminated in the sinfully delicious deep fried bananas with vanilla ice cream and strawberries the bananas enrobed in a featherlight batter and fried to crispy perfection were the perfect accompaniment to the creamy velvety ice cream while the vibrant strawberries added a dash of color and tang to the exquisite dessert

our favourite dish was the pork bun it was so warm the filling was delicious flavourful and fresh

the dumplings we found to be just okay all in all we spent 40 which i think is definitely a little pricier than other dumpling options relative to quality the soup dumplings were not comparable to others ive had  they were mediocre and just didnt get the job done in my opinion as well we found the wrapping of the dumplings to be quite thick i dont think that we would order dumplings from this spot again however seeing the reviews others have left im definitely open to trying other dishes here

the restaurant itself had a charming and elegant ambiance however one minor downside was that the tables were positioned a bit too close together which made it feel a bit cramped at times on our way to the bathroom we had the opportunity to browse the furniture they sell which was a unique and interesting touch

while the overall experience was enjoyable we did find the service to be a little slow it would have been great if the staff were more attentive and prompt in attending to our needs nevertheless the friendly and accommodating nature of the staff made up for the slight delay in service

in conclusion the restaurant provided us with tasty food a pleasant atmosphere and a glimpse into their unique furniture offerings although the tables were a bit close together and the service was a touch slow these minor drawbacks did not significantly impact our overall positive dining experience",0.9922,Good

the food was also quite good too we got the lobster roll the half roasted chicken and the gem lettuce salad and all of them were superior the price is a bit in the higher side but they really do give you an amazing experience so i would say that its reasonable

the waitstaff was also super nice and since we were celebrating a birthday they even came out towards the end to give us a celebration dessert a chocolate chip cookie it was so cute and unexpected and overall really made our day

in short if you get the chance to please give this place a visit the food is good and the atmosphere is even better but just note that the price is on the higher side",0.9945,Good

grande fritti di mare 
gnudi ai funghi 
pizza nduja 
tiramisu 

i order calamari at most places i see it on the menu but ive got to say this is probably the best calamari ive ever had  it was so fresh and soft with a light crisp batter exterior carpaccio was very light and seasoned very well topped with alot of parm  arugula and a soft and cheewy homemade bread the gnudi gnoochi was melt in your mouth soft ive never had it at such a soft texture before very different but also so good with the mushroom truffle sauce im very spicy sensitive and this was the first time i had a nduja pizza i could handle thanks to the great recommendation of our bar server spreading the burrata over the top of the pizza likely helped a lot the tiramsu was rich and creamy a bit thicker texture than others im used to and loved it

Mabu Generation,Taiwanese,"575 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4Y 1Z3 Canada",ON,43.6656019,-79.3846082,3,"overall mabu generation is rather mediocre all things considered although some menu items here do stand out the majority are exceptionally overpriced on busy nights you can expect to join a virtual queue and will have to go elsewhere and wait for a table to open meanwhile which detracts from the experience

the atmosphere is rather flashy and aesthetic though not necessary comfortable it feels more so like a trendy pub at times as it can get quite crowded and loud

of the food notable appetizers include the okonomiyaki fries and the deep fried tofu with garlic sauce both being exceptionally flavourful for the price i dont recommend the bbq crab sticks as they tasted as if they were overseasoned with pepper entreewise i highly recommend sharing the mabu egged sukiyaki with rice although pricey it is exceptionally filling and is definitely a meal fit for more than one person id advise against getting the house special deep fried pork chop with mapo tofu sauce on rice for the price it isnt really noteworthy nor does it taste as spicy as one would expect of mapo tofu and is overall a letdown

i will note however that the rice bowls are decently filling and probably one of the few decent recommendations at mabu likewise the only other solid options at mabu are the desserts but they are exceptionally overpriced if youre fine with burning a bit of cash sharing either the mango or matcha honey cube toast ice cream tower with friends is a solid choice same applies to the mabu house special grass jelly with brown sugar milk tea

the brisket was well trimmed and cooked yet the brisket itself especially the flat muscle was very thin feels like those cheaper ones from walmart and it had a bit weird taste at the first bite i personally didnt enjoy that much and i think its related to the meat quality not cooking skills i also had a couple of slices of point muscle they were okay afterall they were not highpriced though i would be willing to pay a bit more for slightly higher quality of meat",0.7617,Good

upon arriving to our reservation at 730 we were waiting in the lobby for 35 minutes before getting sat the table had been sitting empty otherwise when we were sat it took about 15 minutes for our server to come and drop off waters and plates she walked away before we could get a drink order in and one of the members of our party had to flag her down to order we ended up ordering everything all at once because by this time it was 830 and we had no drinks or food the appetizers came out quite quickly but by 945 we had still not eaten and we had at least 6 empty drinks piled to the end of the tablepictured below
a member of the table asked to speak to management about the wait for our food and they said yeah its ready its coming when they were setting down our food i had to ask them to actually clear the glasses so they could put the plate down the manager or supervisor came over and gave us some wine but no apology no reasoning nothing no water refills no drink refills super weird we were really disappointed a sorry goes a long way with bad service and as a server myself i just dont think this is justified the only reason im leaving two stars instead of one is because the food tasted good i wont be going back",0.7519,Good

do note that this place has a lot of regulars given that whitehorse downtown is a very small downtown and everyone kind of knows each other dont be upset if they dont service you immediately i found that the regulars there know the menu better than the servers my server actually didnt know the price of the special of the day and how much the beers cost so she had to return to the bar to ask and get a menu to show us the price instead all in all service is not strong here for new customers but regulars know the service staff by name

the bison burger is pretty nice first time for me gamey lean tasty well marinated and burger well made the fries were pretty good as well as for the special of the day it was butter chicken ended up being an indian style of butter chicken which was fine

beer was really cold and nice in a retro looking plastic cup probably because many customers broke them after too many a glass

they are one of the few places that do a peking duck dinner you need 24 hours advance notice to order it however

its a favorite of a lot of people
serving hong kong cafe style food
it was popular to go there for ying yang mix of hong kong style tea and coffee
they have afternoon tea specials as well 595 we did the fried rice with tomato sauce it didnt really have much tomato but that was fine as it tasted delicious with a smoke flavor cantonese people call it wok hay
we also did the lunch special which was breaded pork cutlet 895

presentation is very aesthetic food is tasty and light on the stomach it does not feel like it weighs you down sushi rice on the rolls is a good texture and not too sticky

if you are able to go for ramen its one of the better bowls you can find in the city they only offer these at lunch though and they are limited so be prepared

we got there and the place was packed and loud so if you want to have a conversation with someone good luck  not a romantic couples date spot in the least
we were seated and waited an awfully long time for someone to come to our table keep in mind theres a pretty strict 2 hour time limit in place here your times are even scribbled on your order sheet as reference  we finally had a server come and explain how the menu works after we explained its our first visit  we ordered and waited a long time again to get our food delivered  to the point that we were getting annoyed because several tables that arrived after us were getting heaps of food delivered and well into their meals  food finally came and honestly at the steep 4095 per person price tag it wasnt worth it  you can see from past reviews and my pictures that the price has literally skyrocketed
they offer no guidance on cooking you just toss things on your in table bbq and hope for the best  id suggest skipping the sushi because its sloppy and just mediocre  a lot of rice and seaweed and not much else  so the sushi was a big disappointment
the beer price tag was a bit of a shock too at 10 for a single pint
the bathrooms are pretty run down and gross  doors dont latch and the toilet didnt flush  our server was nice enough not outstanding service or anything just adequate
the parking lot is atrocious with huge severe bumps and holes  the parking spaces are a joke so tiny you can barely get in and out of your vehicle
overall im glad to have given this restaurant a shot but i was not wowed and am not in a rush to return",-0.0472,Bad

the chicken schnitzel with obrien potatoes and sweet and sour cabbage was definitely the highlight all the flavors were excellent and the portions were generous very crisp and tasty schnitzel on the other hand the paprika chicken was disappointing the portion size was generous again however the flavours were nothing special and the dish was overpriced in our opinion

the server was curt throughout the meal and we felt like we were inconveniencing them not friendly and made no attempt at making it a personal experience besides this it is a cozy little restaurant for a winter evening the food also arrived quickly and drinks were refilled as needed

Colosseo Ristorante Italiano,Caterers,"670 Corydon Ave Winnipeg, MB R3M 0X7 Canada",MB,49.8715228,-97.1503885,1,"where do i start

the first thing i thought when i was here with my partner was ive always wanted to try this place out the second one was i think ive seen this episode of gordon ramsays kitchen nightmares before some first impressions are the most important but in this case it was the second

my partner got the pesto linguine which as you can see from the attached photo was drenched in oil immediately upon receiving the plate pushing down gently on the noodles revealed a layer of oil underneath halfway through as shown the situation hadnt improved i could picture gordon ramsay commenting about the quantity of oil probably using language more colourful than the basil

i had looked at the menu and saw homemade pasta with an entry for cannelloni i make fresh pasta semiregularly so i was excited to try this entree what i got was _not_ what i was anticipating as before images of gordon ramsay shouting its not fresh its frozen popped into my mind the meat mixture alone was off the taste was acceptable but no more but the texture was pasty at best and the pasta the pasta was well and truly bad fresh homemade pasta is not a hard thing to make even just semolina and water can give excellent results this however was not that it had clearly been frozen at some point in its lifecycle perhaps long ago it cracked a little from the dry interior as i cut through it with the knife the flavor was off as well in a way that i cannot explain ive had better noodles from a grocery store box by an order of magnitude ive also had better frozen meat filled pasta dishes from a grocery store box as well

and thats nothing to say of the overall experience the staff cut my partner off twice when asking a question put their hands on our shoulders without asking and were the loudest fixture of the establishment the guests were far quieter and the only ambience was the staff joking with each other while sharing things on their phones

overall this trip was characterized by regret my stomach not 30 minutes from my experience there is gurgling and uncomfortable my partners is as well for 30 a plate you would expect quality or at least quantity but we received neither i regret choosing to not waste the food i regret making the choice to give it a try and i regret mostly not having a personal tip line to gordon ramsay

the vibe of the pub was a british underground space and pretty spacious at the time i went which was late dinner
service
a little slow and not busy at all i went late evening so there werent many servers around that time
food
the sunday roast  turned out to be a huge meal for one it came with a puff pastry on top mash long beans and cooked carrots and some thin slices of roast beef it wasnt bad for the price point

minisausage rolls  this one was probably my favorite it seemed to have missed its garnish in another review i saw but other than that it was the sauce which made it tasty it came with a chutney like sweet sauce to dip the rolls in it had a decent portion to share between 23 people

the wee pie flight  this was small enough to taste test each of the savory pies but i didnt find anything too special with them

overall food was not bad for a late night snack or meal i would go again just for the sausage rolls i found them addicting

the menu is extensive with many different japanese plates to choose from we had the green onion  sesame sauce takoyaki spicy chicken katsu yakisoba and teriyaki mayo karaage don the highlight was the spicy chicken katsu the sauce was excellent and the breading was just the right amount of crispy

the portion sizes were large and ended up taking enough home another full meal the prices were affordable especially given the amount of food for two people it would be reasonable to share one appetizer and one main dish

the staff were very friendly and the food was served impressively fast the decor is an eclectic mix and the furniture was a bit uncomfortable however this was not an issue we enjoyed taking a walk through the gift shop upstairs after our dinner

Dwarf No Cachette Cafe & Gift,Japanese,"157 Provencher Boulevard Winnipeg, MB R2H 0G2 Canada",MB,49.89201440000001,-97.1234694,4,"i visited this restaurant by a recommendation for japanese izakaya food there were about 10 of us and was pleasantly surprised that they had room when we showed up at around 67pm i made sure to call beforehand though just in case

vibe
its a cute and quirky little restaurant featuring gnomes and dwarf decor arrangements it was cozy inside and on the top floor there was a local gift shop the shop sold cute little knickknacks from handmade jewelry pins to anime buttons and stickers

service
the service was pretty good for having to deal with all 10 of us and we didnt have to wait too long to get seated the only downfall was that one of the drinks we ordered didnt quite match up to the description of the menu on their website we ordered from some of the food items or specials on the website were not on the menu either but were still available to order

food
what we were intentionally drawn with by choosing to eat at this restaurant were the playful drinks the zelda themed drinks were fun and we would have no idea about these drinks if not for checking the website

onigiri combo takoyaki  3 choices of onigiri which i chose 1tuna mayo 2 karage 3 shrimp tempura and it came with a miso soup and 6 pieces of regular takoyaki the onigiris were huge and i ended up only being able to finish one and taking the rest home to go the takoyaki came out with floating pieces of the bonito flakes waving in the air as expected the miso soup was very rich in flavor and i dont think i ever had sesame in miso soup before

drinks
milkshake shingenmochi with black sugar syrup  this drink is very delicious and sweet with the black sugar syrup and chewy mochis

master sword  cold sake calpico and club soda mix with a master sword iced jelly the master sword jelly gets floppy pretty quickly when left out too long so its best to take the pics quick and then stir the drink with the master sword

hearty elixir  peach redbull and red coloring its a tangy and pretty refreshing drink for the summer

blue jelly sake soda  i found the blue jelly was fun to stir around in my drink but the blue jelly itself tasted pretty bland and not that great with the sake its nice for photos only

apple popping boba sake  this was an alright tasting drink and it only made it better with the popping bobas the light hitting the bobas made the drink look radioactive and was fun to take pics of

i would go here again just to try their other dishes everything looked and sounded so good we all had trouble choosing what to get

while the meaty penne was a bit saucy and lacked some flavor to my personal preference the sausages in both pasta dishes were slightly firm regrettably the main dishes didnt quite live up to expectations considering the price

they say vegetarian but all the dishes are vegan

deep fried mushrooms  5   wonderful flavor on them texture was a bit thicker and chewier than i would like but some might enjoy it

beef with ginger and green onions 4   when i brought the leftovers to my friend he questioned if it was actual beef this was my least favorite dish however out of what we tried

hot and sour soup 4   it was very good but i didnt prefer how sweet it was if the added sweetness wasnt there i would have done a 5

tofu with peanut sauce 5   i was but expecting to like this as much as i did

they had a decaf tea that was roasted rice and ginger which was very pleasant it is a hint of ginger flavoring

service was excellent 5  with the server on top of the leftovers and the bill

the interior is much slicker looking then what i remember it is modern and does not resemble your typical chinese restaurant
it is located right on pembina near the stellas parking is available on the street and side streets

i started off with the butternut squash soup with coconut milk and a hint of ginger with corn chips this was one of the best soups ive ever had the combination was fantastic and it was very flavourful

i then had the slowroasted rosemary manitoba bison served with potato squash mash seasonal vegetables horseradish gravy jus  wild blueberry compote it was without a doubt an outstanding dish the bison was soft lean and very rich in flavour and the combination of the mashed potatoes and the wild blueberry compote skyrocketed the flavour of the dish because it added a bit of sourness and sweetness to activate all the flavours of the mouth

Helios Restaurant,Greek,"241 St Mary's Road Winnipeg, MB R2H 1J4 Canada",MB,49.87487609999999,-97.1169439,4,"i had to edit this review as a lot of things i had originally posted became outdated after a month i was here more than once in that month since i did enjoy it so this is an amalgamated review

i debated between 3 and 4 on this visit but ultimately went with a 4 the service was fine on this visit from our server she took direction but not initiative the food is generally good im still waiting to find that dish that i have fall in love with and crave all the time

it didnt start out well they had a water issue which was the same water issue that was there from a month before that i guess is still not resolved the water is yellow they could not serve tap water or make tea if tea hot water etc is important to you you are out of luck

on this visit i had brought a group of people from out of town to try helios originally they had platters which were priced well for their assortment of items to try we were told they no longer have them they were meant for customers to try everything and get a taste of the food but since they have been here long enough they felt it was no longer necessary we were disappointed to hear that as it made for great presentation and was nice to have a sampling

portion sizes are large for everything

when we went originally there seemed to be 3 sizes for salads half salad is not the same as a starter pictures below show the difference we used the pellegrino can to help show size however i am unsure if they changed that since

we went for lunch this time the other times it was dinner
if you order the fries with fish expect a lot of fries and only a little fish the full serving of calamari i felt was not as good as the side that you add to your meal its almost the same in value but half portions often cost more so if you do want all that calamari go ahead but half portions are equally fine
the slouvaki lunches seemed to be the best value and looked well balanced
the caviar dip this time was not as good as the first time we tried it
highlights was flaming cheese because flames the pan is larger where the cheese is a smaller piece in the center it comes served with pita bread
there was a lot of dressing on our half salad and a more moderate amount i preferred this one on our starter which makes me feel it can be inconsistent

service is standard some are better than others they usually did not go out of their way but they were friendly and did their job
i feel like the pricing is fair for what you get
i appreciated everything came out piping hot",0.9948,Good

the entrees pork tenderloin skewers and stuffed pepper arrived at our table after a short wait and were hot the meals themselves were very tasty the lemon potatoes were very good and a nice bite the tenderloin was very tangy and super tender
