update i highly recommend the prime rib sandwich as an alternative to the traditional dinner menu items  its less spendy and just as tasty the tender meat strong horseradish its the best at the keg and generous portion of red wine herb jus were all very flavourful i substituted a caesar salad instead of fries at no additional cost its only 16 during cocktail hour on the bar side ill be going back for it again very soon",0.9879,Good

on this occasion we ordered the
1 hand pulled noodle in braised beef soup  the soup has a nice beef flavor and the cuts of beef are tender and flavorful noodles are al dente which i liked my only complaint is that the dish could use a bit more vegetables to accompany it
2 stir fried noodle with cumin lamb and vegetables  in my mind this should be their featured dish the lamb is tender and seasoned well the cumin flavor is not over powering and the noodles are firm but not tough very enjoyable to eat
3 sesame balls  i would not recommend ordering these they are probably around 80 dough it is a bit dry and the filling is fairly minimal and i was only able to guess that the filling is red bean from the visual rather than taste

overall their noodle dishes are excellent and at a pretty reasonable price will be back for these",0.8752,Good

our favourite entree is the poleko grill with the new zealand lamb the lamb is so tender and roasted flavour is delicious

the garlic bread is really good and always worth upgrading to recently i tried their coconut bread  amazing its got shredded coconut inside the bread but its not overly sweet in fact the slight sweetness is a great vessel for their sauces and curries

 crispy spring roll good amount of filling and had a thin crispy skin
 crispy gyoza would have preferred the skin to be more golden brown for a better crunch
 fried shrimp cakes unfortunately these missed the mark  you would think these are just blended fish cakes
 truffle tater tots the truffle was just right for me and was a nice touch to what would otherwise be just tater tots
 chicken karaage the chicken was tender but otherwise did not stand out particularly
sushi  sashimi  overall fresh and good balance of flavors particularly the bluefin tuna roll the thickness of the rolls was not too much for me and had a good ratio of rice to fillings to fish
 bluefin tuna roll this was excellent  there was a nice citrus fragrance with each bite from the yuzu tobiko
 special roll platter comes with 5 special rolls  the one that stood out the most was the truffle prawn roll which again carried a good truffle flavor that was not overpowering

my friend had beet pastrami sandwich i loved this sandwich it had a lot of beets and a lot of flavors 100 recommend but i wish it came with some side side fries are 7 the price is as same as appetizer item  zaatar fries i personally thought add on side items should be smaller potion and more affordable price but it is just my personal opinion

one thing we felt like need an improvement was that the beet pastrami sandwich was not listed as vegetarian item and it also said ask for veg meaning ask for vegan option we found it a bit confusing as we initially thought it was beef pastrami as it did not have vegetarian icon on the menu

also our server did not come back after she delivered food when there were only 2 other tables when we were eating

rotating bread  8310 last time i came i enjoyed the bread rotation they had more depends on what bread they have that day

zaatar fries  910 crispy fries that are still soft on the inside wish they had more sauce large amount of fries for the price

salad  didnt eat great portions pictures dont do it justice the salad was piled high

steak  7910 steak was well cooked puree and toppings paired well with the steak didnt like that the caramelized onions were whole in this dish quite sweet small portion of steak for the price

mac and cheese  7510 pasta was cooked well did not like the excess of the crunchy topping
cookie with cream  8510 soft and sweet cookie and the cream helps cut some of the sweetness great end to the meal

service  7810 service was good water was filled a couple times throughout the night

walking up to the restaurant it looked open and inviting especially with all of the windows

walking in i was pleasantly greeted even though the server was a little busy i knew i had her attention enough so that she could finish with the client she was already helping and she attended me directly after assisting the other patron i dont think she felt rushed either because it seemed her needs were met and the server moved on

i was seated promptly as she seemed to know exactly were my family was but i didnt feel like an annoyance even though i was about five minutes late for our reservation

our table server was prompt with asking for my drink order and exposing the menu she was polite and didnt rush me for my order

we had a few brief questions that were answered exactly which made our orders go through quicker

while waiting on our food we all commented on the decor of the restaurant its such a big and open space but they were still able to make it feel cozy and comfortable there was a brunch rush going on but we werent bothered by ambient noise and i felt like there was adequate enough that we didnt have to worry about eavesdropping

the food service was prompt and the plating was great each serving plate was different and retro and the food fit it well with the portions

i had the pirogies with pork belly and it was fantastic our table shared their house salad with fresh greens and mushrooms with a perfect amount of dressing on it

my friend ordered chicken tacos but asked first if they were spicy because hes not a big fan and he was told no they were mild they turned out to be quite spicy

their food prices are very very low compared to anywhere else on that street but the old saying you get what you pay for definitely applies here

El Furniture Warehouse,Bars,"107 Stephen Ave SW Calgary, AB T2P 1B4 Canada",AB,51.0453335,-114.0635759,1,"my recent visit to el furniture warehouse left me utterly disappointed and dissatisfied i had ordered the general tao cauliflower bowl and from start to finish the experience was nothing short of frustrating

firstly the service was incredibly slow it took a staggering 40 minutes for our order to be brought out and only after we inquired about its status the lack of attentiveness from the waitress was evident and it seemed like the order was entirely forgotten

when the waitress finally brought out my meal i was taken aback by its appearance the dish did not look like cauliflower as i had expected i raised this concern with the waitress and she took another trip back to the kitchen to doublecheck upon her return she assured me that it was indeed cauliflower dismissing my doubts rather casually

due to the extensive wait my friends and i had already decided to pack the food into togo boxes as soon as it was served this made it impossible for me to try the food on the spot and identify the issue immediately

it was only when i got back to the office and began eating the meal that i realized the dish i had been served was not cauliflower as advertised but instead chicken this revelation was particularly distressing to me as i cannot consume chicken for religious reasons

this experience was incredibly upsetting and disrespectful as it not only wasted my time but also disrespected my dietary restrictions the lack of care and attention to detail from the staff is unacceptable and i am deeply disappointed by the entire ordeal

i will certainly not be returning to el furniture warehouse and i advise anyone with dietary restrictions or a desire for efficient service to steer clear of this establishment the misrepresentation of dishes and the disregard for customers needs make it clear that this restaurant falls far short of the dining experience one should expect",-0.7578,Bad

our server was just that to our little group  she clearly knows how to give good customer service  she knew the menu inside and out gave good suggestions and was patient with us when we were not sure what to have when an item of the menu wasnt available  however with great cheer she announced that something was back and got what we ordered  despite being busy our server checked in with us and was very speedy when it came to getting our meals

our meals were absolutely delicious  it was impressive to see that such good food wasnt so crazy expensive when we ordered it  there was a little nervousness that the dishes were going to be smaller than what we had thought due to the price  however this was not the case at all  things here were a good sized and sated our hunger perfectly

what we ordered was a couple of powerbowls and some garlic cheese sticks as an appetizer  the powerbowls were fresh flavourful and full of amazing textures  we had some tang and zip thanks to the dressing  the vegetables had a lovely crunch and crispiness where it should  the rice was perfectly cooked and the protein added created a nice balance to the whole thing  the garlic cheese bread was a pleasant temperature and with all that melted cheese made a person have the kind of comfort that food should bring  the marinara sauce that came with it was a little cool but the tomato basil savouriness more than makes up for it

if you are looking to have a nice night out with a loved one but have a budget that you must keep this is the place to go  this is a place that is good for a date night birthday party with friends or you are taking in a play at one of the theatres near by  check in today because you will leave feeling happy",0.9968,Good

they are located in up edmonton trail in industrial area dont let the location fool you because once you open the door there is fun and beautiful restaurant with awesome bar and the best brunch

my favorite is queens breakfast it comes with sweet and savory in one plate if you cannot decide what to order i 100 recommend you to order this one their potato is not like other brunch places it is crispy outside and fluffy inside rusty shape gives a lot of texture i like how they cook eggs they do not ask how you like the eggs but they always cook eggs perfectly

what i love the most is their ricotta pancake and waffles it is so soft fluffy flavorful you cannot find something like this in any other restaurant in calgary it is worth trying

their hours on the door said open til 9 on fridays but they seemed to want us out at 8 we had gotten there at 7 so it isnt like we came right before closing and expected full service

i was here on a double date with my girlfriend and another couple and after our terrible experience my girlfriend tipped 2 and the other couple tipped 0 which i think was fair based on the level of terrible service but then another woman the managerowner maybe came to our table after and told the other couple to at least leave a few dollars for the server thats super unprofessional and ive never experienced that at any restaurant or bar in canada

we ordered
1 the ginger chicken rice
2 steak sandwich
3 lobster wrap
4 schnitzel sandwich

the ginger chicken rice was extremely wet with the balsamic vinegar applied too generously this made the dish much too sweet for my liking the chicken and vegetables were fine

steak sandwich was almost well done although we asked for medium rare other than that it was perfectly edible

the filling in the lobster wrap tasted almost like coleslaw with little bits and pieces of lobster in scattered throughout the wrap

the schnitzel in the schnitzel sandwich was extremely thin and underwhelming when biting into the sandwich one can only taste the breading with little to no actual meat the toasted bread is also extremely hard

the meats are marinated well and quite tender especially the beef the spreads including the pate have a nice flavor which compliments the sandwiches

the biggest complaint is that the amount of fillings in the sandwich are fairly scant the layer of meat is as thin as can be and does not cover the entire bread surface on the inside the assorted cold cut has maybe 2 kinds of cuts this makes the bread to everything else ratio very high especially compared to other places their sandwiches are also more expensive so overall they do not feel as worth it

located in an unassuming strip mall in northeast calgary one would never expect this amazing little ramen hot spot to be here however it has earned quite the reputation for providing delicious food in a comfortable welcoming setting

each time we come here it is always busy  usually with a bit of a wait  so plan in advance

the staff is so incredibly warm welcoming and attentive they are always  happy to provide recommendations or explain menu items

as for the food  it is absolutely incredible the dimension of flavour in the broth both the porkbased and the vegan yambased options is  outstanding and always keeps us coming back for more the homemade noodles thick thin and kale option are always so fresh and perfectly al dente

each ramen comes with a generous smear of spicy miso paste on the inside of the bowl so you can customize the spice to your liking a list of spicier chili options are also available

while there is a decent portion of toppings included within the set price there is also a wide variety of additional toppings to choose from for an additional small charge we love adding the egg  it is so flavourful and tender with a unique yolk obtained from the stewing process

the menu is very broad with options for every taste from the appetizer menu the chicken karaage is delicious and moist and you can choose to substitute it for the standard pork if you wish

as other reviewers have mentioned parking is a bit of a challenge only two spots out front of the restaurant we ended up parking in the paid lot on 16th

the restaurant is small nothing more than a counter and a very small bartype sitting area we were lucky to snag the seating area as we wanted to eat our chicken hot and fresh staff were friendly and helpful

ordered the lil clucker sandwich motha clucker sandwich a four piece of fried chicken good bites for the kids and an order of fries to share the kids really enjoyed the all dark meat good bites big meaty portions and nice and crispy my husband and i on the other hand found the chicken in our sandwiches to be very bland definitely lacking any sort of salt and a bit over cooked the chicken pieces were the same

price point cluck n cleaver is not cheap for the 4 of us it was close to 80 which i felt was overpriced for the value and quality i dont think well be returning any time soon more disappointed than anything else",0.9841,Good

went looking for ethiopian food as my favourite restaurant seems to have closed down and selected this place based on reviews which is why i felt compelled to leave one myself
the vibe is actually kind of neat tiki style bar and pool tables but the service was bad the food was bad and we were scammed by the staff and left with no option but to pay

we ordered kitfo from the menu ground beef dish and i asked if they had dorowat chicken drumstick dish and she said no but recommended another chicken drumstick dish  i ordered a coffee to start it came after the meal more on that later and we asked for water to drink  we were served two room temperature bottles of water and when our food came it was the complete wrong food  it was tibs and chacha no chicken and not ground beef  i asked if this was the kitfo and chicken we ordered and she said not today and walked away not to return for 40 minutes with my coffee

the food was pretty bland tasted of mild spices and extremely dry meat  one dish was laden with knuckle bone and bone fragments  the coffee was served over 20 minutes after we were done eating and it has yellow fishing line bunched up in the end  i asked about it and she stold me i was to keep the plastic string it in to act as a filter but still ended up with a cup full of coffee grounds  gross

when the bill came we were grossly overcharged  the meals were on the menu at 17 each and the coffee was 5 but we were blown away to see the bill the meals were 25 each the coffee was 20 and our waters were 6  for two waters  i asked why the prices were so off and she said meat cost is high today  i told her it was not alright and that the menu said different prices and she wouldnt have it left us with no option but to pay almost double what the bill should have been  beware",-0.9805,Bad

Alloy,Canadian (New),"220 42 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2G 1Y4 Canada",AB,51.0163225,-114.060178,5,"if i could give this place ten stars i would i cant believe ive lived in calgary for 15 years and only just had the pleasure of dining at this calgary culinary landmark

everything from the ambiance decor food and service was absolutely incredible

my date and i started with the hummus and the pita bread was so pillowy soft inside with a nice crisp exterior making it a perfect vessel for the perfectly seasoned velvety hummus

upon the recommendation of friends who have dined here previously we had the gnocchi and short ribs they were featuring a pork belly its my absolute favourite protein so had to have that also

the gnocchi was the best gnocchi ive ever had each mouthful was an absolutely decadent dream on my palate ive never had such delicious pillowy morsels of perfection in my life and i have eaten at some notable restaurants in ny toronto and vancouver this gnocchi dish was absolutely divine

next came the pork belly which was a summer feature i hope it becomes a permanent menu item the pork belly was cooked to perfection and the dollops of black garlic sauce gave the dish a moorish umami flavour the pickles emoji mushrooms were a nice touch it cut through the richness of the dish and made it a perfectly balanced dish

the short ribs did not disappointmassive chunks of beefy perfection served with a velvety mash that eased the palate after tasting the robust flavours of the reduction i am salivating as i type this review by the way

the wine list is vast and even though i cant recall what we had they made for perfect pairings with our meal

lastly its nice to dine at a restaurant that has not lowered the standard of service after covid further to that note theres a reason why this gem of a restaurant has a loyal following its a great date spot has amazing food and impeccable service

the food was unreal i got the goat cheese salad but i tried some of my friends truffle gnocchi oh boy so good cant go wrong with either choices but if you like truffles andor gnocchi the choice is clear the braised short rib was my main and it was so tender and delicious we got each of the desserts to try oreo cake mango custard passion cheesecake and those were really really good too my favourite was the cheesecake but i couldnt taste too much of the passion fruit the gelato with the oreo cake was delicious the mango custard was our least favourite but its still good i think the chutney and cardamom threw us off a bit especially having the other two right before hand

nuts and bolts  the food is delicious affordable 35ish  tip per person and the location is easy to access in kensington

the ambiance is an extension of the food bizzare line yet once youve dined at shijo youll experience what i am trying to poorly describe  i really ought to expand my vocabulary

ambiance
from the onset the scent of a mild salt reminiscent of the ocean tickles you when you enter

the lights are easy on the eyes neither too dim nor bright and we exited shijo we were not jarred by the sunshine they found the goldilocks zone for lights for lunch anyways

the chairs are comfortable for a range of sizes  im a larger chap and my wife is slender we both felt relaxed in our seats which is rare

the decor and music maintains a respectful distance but is not muted its like a street performer maintaining a respectful distance and allows you to come to them so when we chose to focus on the music or decor you could lose yourself in the details and come back to conversation comfortably

food
finally the food is an embodiment of all the aspects of the ambiance from scent to sight to feel of the food when you eat to being pleasing to the eyes there is a subliminal element of beauty in the food from presentation to flavor

we ate our fill of 3 sushi rolls and each bite was so complex and just beautiful to experience even as we grew sated

we went on opening day at around 4pm and the place wasnt too busy its a beautiful restaurant in the brewery with lots of spacious outdoor and indoor seating we had the fully loaded nachos with brisket we wouldve liked a lot more nachos for 2650 they were delicious though

we also got the lone star platter as well hm actually didnt get any pickles but chalking that up to opening day roughness i enjoyed the brisket but would have liked it to be more flavorful juicy and tender ribs had excellent flavor but needs to be more juicy and tender

pulled pork is rarely my favorite but it was good i wouldve liked it to be a bit more juicy i liked the brown bbq sauce it had great flavor depth the red one wasnt as good tasted more like it came out of the bottle loved the spicy fries potato salad needs more flavor very bland beans were good

we also had a lime cherry sour and a peach cider that was delicious i have the viennese lager but that wasnt anything special to me

my wife grew up in the southern united states and while weve tried a lot of barbecue here in alberta this is easily the best one by a texas mile i was so excited to come here knowing i personally prefer texas style barbecue over the more saucy southern styles

we ordered the 75 lonestar platter and banana cream pudding not pictured and had lots to take home after eating our fill

the brisket was tender juicy melt in your mouth delicious and yes it passes the bend test its just amazing and easily the best in yyc

the ribs were my wifes favorite on the platter we like the flavor of them they were tender without being mushy and had a nice bite to them

the pulled pork on the white bread with a little sauce and slaw was just chefs kiss the quality and smoke on all the meat is very easy to see and taste

we need to talk about the sides i feel like at most barbecue places the sides are a throw on to make you feel like you got a platter  not here all family recipes passed down and served to you to enjoy the beans were our favorite  but all were delicious

finally the banana cream pudding my wife said she hasnt had propper pudding for over 7 years now last time she was home well this is it it was so amazing shes sold on it and well be back just for that and honestly everything else

the staff were all so kind and accommodating as well we really really enjoyed our visit and will absolutely be back again

the place is located on the side of the building

interior during the pandemic allows for reasonable seating capacity

service was also good and quick

the menu options are straightforward and prices are agreeable

we ordered the chicken burger combo and a clam combo as well as an iced tea

the burger was very good breading on the patty was crispy and the burger was appropriately mayod the lettuce would have been crispier it was a tad wilted additionally the burger was pretty small

the clams were spot on excellent breading

iced tea was good not super sweat

the one thing would mention is the fries the texture was good crispy outside however a critical flaw was present a complete lack of salt the issue is that once out the fryer the things harden up and without that initial salt kick any salt you try to add on basically bounces off

The Wine Cellar/Steakhouse @ the Glynmill Inn,Seafood,"1 Cobb Lane Corner Brook, NL A2H 2V3 Canada",NL,48.9479881,-57.9387519,1,"i would like to shout out the exceptional service provided by the waitstaff who exhibited great attentiveness and amiability throughout the dining experience unfortunately the culinary experience presented was a significant disappointment considering the establishments label as a steakhouse and its associated price range the lack of aaa usda prime or canadian angus beef is indeed disheartening furthermore the lack of knowledge regarding the duration of dry aging when i inquired is a significant oversight as it holds huge importance in delivering a proper steakhouse experience given these factors it is difficult to justify the prices charged for the menu items on offer

mindful of this after asking waitresses i played the safe route for their burger presuming that one cannot go wrong with  a classic choice prior to placing the order i took the initiative to inquire about the freshness of their cod with hopes of indulging in the renowned newfoundland variety however it was disconcerting to learn that the cod was frozen and there was no information available regarding its capture date to further assess the establishments caliber i ordered a side of risotto which typically serves as a clear indicator of a restaurants culinary prowess unfortunately what was presented was an overcooked rendition akin to commercially available uncle bens rice

the caesar salad priced at 16 proved to be one of the most disappointing elements of the meal it featured predominantly pale lettuce leaves scantily dressed with an overly tart lemon vinaigrette and lacking the generous sprinkling of parmesan one would expect once my burger arrived i was greeted with a disheartening sighta sizable bun admittedly of good quality dwarfing a desiccated patty that had seemingly lost all moisture within a mere halfminute admittedly the burger did exhibit a commendable fattobeef ratio which could have been an appealing characteristic had the establishment prioritized quality control

while it is not my intention to disparage an establishment unjustly i must express my disappointment as a visitor drawn into what appears to be a touristoriented establishment as someone who travels extensively and with family members who traverse the country in pursuit of memorable dining experiences the exorbitant pricing coupled with the lackluster culinary execution is truly disheartening it is my sincere hope that the management takes measures to address the issues plaguing their kitchen as i believe such changes are necessary to restore the establishments reputation until these concerns are adequately resolved i would advise potential patrons to consider alternative dining options

when youre at an upscale restaurant paying upscale prices  you dont expect to hear everyone around you asking the servers for salt  yet thats exactly what was happening  including ourselves  the dishes simply had no flavor  its not that i like overly salty foods either  the dishes could have benefited from citrus and other spices to brighten them up and add some depth  its no fun spending nearly 200 on a meal you can barely choke down

we had the caesar salad app fresh crisp romaine i believe on top a french baguette with a perfectly balanced dressing crunchy and juicy pork belly for the usual bacon topping and a very healthy topping of fresh parmesan our entree was the chicken supreme with an onion soubise marinated in a garlic herb buttermilk seared to perfect chicken thigh that was perfection in the center just a touch of pink which you can have without it bring undercooked if you didnt know and very moist flavor throughout the entire thing topped with a creamy onion sauce rested on a bed of creamy cheesy risotto i dont like rice at all it may have been my favorite part of the entire dish that id go back just to enjoy again served with roasted asparagus and cherry tomatoes everything was so fresh and balanced each other just so especially our wine pairing we finished our supper with one of each dessert all delightful in their own right i cannot remember the name of our favorite just that it wasnt the ukrainian honey cake or dark chocolate cherry moose though still better than most desserts in town the cook andrew oquinn is certainly doing something with food i have not experienced anything alike in corner brook before i swear it was one of the best meals weve ever had and cannot wait to go back again soon

Gusto Italian Grill & Bar,Bars,"130 Westmorland Street Moncton, NB E1C 1G2 Canada",NB,46.0878414,-64.7785706,3,"overall the impression of the establishment is good thanks to its modern interior the size of the venue is impressive with two floors the first floor has vip tables and a small open area while the second floor features a large open space with a big bar and an open kitchen if you dont like it when its noisy the second floor is not for you and if you want to have a conversation its not ideal either 

the menu is excellent but there is a lack of nonalcoholic beverages there were only two sweet cocktails in the main menu which is not great for such a restaurant we ordered risotto and pepperoni pizza and both dishes were very tasty and lived up to our expectations

as for the downsides of the evening the unexpected letdown was the waitress who served our table when i asked for nonalcoholic wine the waitress reacted as if she didnt know it existed then i asked her about the nonalcoholic drink options since there were only two cocktails listed in the main menu however she pointed to the same cocktails and said that was all they had it turned out they had coffee as well but unfortunately no one informed me about it when i asked for nonalcoholic options and when i asked if they had tiramisu she didnt respond and just said she would better bring me a dessert menu which didnt include tiramisu there was a small incident with our drink and the manager came to our table and said they would replace it however the waitress approached us after about 10 minutes and asked if we wanted to replace it with the same drink or another one which confused us because the manager had already told us they would replace it with the same one and bring it soon in the end after those 10 minutes we had to wait for another 1015 minutes she didnt even smile much which was very strange i havent experienced something like this before

overall such service is not acceptable and it spoils the positive impression of the restaurant i came to the restaurant with a smile and in a good mood but i left in a bad mood on my birthday

however the rest of the staff seemed very pleasant and friendly therefore overall i recommend this place",0.8665,Good

for several years i have dined at this restaurant and my experience has been consistently great as they have stated in their banner they claim to have the best wings in town and honestly i really dont disagree with them along with a large assortment of meals on the menu you also have options for just about anything you want to try and out of everything i have eaten i havent really had a bad meal plus they always have a special night for wings burgers steak and more so its good to check their website or call ahead if you want to know what specials they have on

their food has usually been pretty tasty as long as you dont mind waiting a little longer for them to prepare it on average the wait time can be anywhere between 20 minutes to an hour depending on how busy they are but they keep you busy with a large selection of alcoholic beverages and nonalcoholic on busy nights i find it can get a little noisy if its a packed restaurant but it is a great spot in town for the whole family to enjoy

Fox N Hound Neighbourhood Pub,American (Traditional),"720 Coverdale Road Riverview, NB E1B 3L4 Canada",NB,46.0595479,-64.817384,1,"i recently had the unfortunate experience of dining at a restaurant that left me utterly dissatisfied and questioning the meaning of value for money let me save you the trouble and warn you to steer clear of this establishment especially when it comes to their nachos prepare yourself for the shocking tale of my encounter with severely overpriced mediocrity

firstly lets address the elephant in the room the price i was flabbergasted when the bill arrived revealing a staggering 22 charge for a plate of nachos now i understand that restaurants sometimes justify higher prices with superior quality or generous portions but this case was far from it i expected a nacho extravaganza bursting with tantalizing toppings and an abundance of mouthwatering goodness what i received instead was an insult to both my taste buds and my wallet

upon closer inspection the nacho plate resembled a barren wasteland the portion size was woefully inadequate consisting of a mere eight frozen chicken cubes yes you read that rightfrozen haphazardly scattered across a bed of tortilla chips to add insult to injury a meager sprinkling of cheese was carelessly melted over this sad excuse for a snack i couldnt help but wonder if i had stumbled into a cheesy nightmare rather than a restaurant

the chicken cubes themselves were lackluster devoid of any flavor or seasoning it was as if the cook had blindly thrown them on the plate straight from the freezer without even a hint of effort or care im left questioning why they bothered to include chicken at all if it was going to be this abysmal it felt like a cheap ploy to justify the exorbitant price tag preying on unsuspecting customers with inflated expectations

considering the lack of effort creativity and quality in these nachos i can only conclude that the restaurants management is either oblivious to the concept of customer satisfaction or shamelessly prioritizes profit margins above all else it is simply unacceptable to charge such an exorbitant amount for a few frozen chicken cubes and a smattering of cheese on a bed of tortilla chips

in conclusion if youre searching for a culinary experience that delivers on taste value and customer satisfaction i implore you to look elsewhere the nachos at this restaurant are a classic case of highway robbery leaving you with a bitter taste in your mouth and a lighter wallet save yourself the disappointment and seek out a dining establishment that respects their customers enough to provide a reasonable meal at a fair price",-0.8099,Bad

i noticed todays special was a very glamorous grilled cheese and the description made it sound extremely appetizing not ones normal nor simple type of grilled cheese
although i was tempted i stuck with my original reason for going here to try their korean meal selection
at the counter i ordered their advertised on the wall bbw pork consisting of bbq pork of course fried eggs steamed rice and greens
i was not sure what the greens were but found them delicious visually reminded me of mermaid tails but very small
pat ordered the japchae and mandoo dumplings went with the beef and pork option her choice consisted of stir fried sweet potatoes vermicelli noodles once again when eating out pat had enough left overs for her dinner later this day
i completed the eating of my meal and felt very content afterwards
pat especially enjoyed her café latte i truly enjoyed the freshly made strawberry smoothie i had intended to go with their famous hot chocolate but the idea of a smoothie overtook me next time we both look forward to returning when i asked pat what she thought of this place she stated its my new number one place

i ordered a large cheese extra cheese light sause with square cut and well done

receieved a large cheese extra cheese extra sauce normal cut normal cook

that isnt all covid is still a thing an the box was not sealed with a sticker to indicate it wasnt opened by anyone after baking so i was hesitant to actually touch it

so i called to get it corrected as with prior stores in bc and their regulations are if the pizza is wrong it will be remade an replaced usually having the pizza made taken back or given out for free with the error

i was told

sorry but if you order from us again call the store next time and we will make it the way you want it i made that pizza myself so i dont see what the problem is  but if you wanted extra sauce just call

i shouldnt have to order online or go into a store to order a pizza or any other food and then have to go home only to realize the order that i ordered was not the order that i ordered and then have to call in to be told oh well you should have called us while they were making it

however over the past 5 to 6 years ive observed some noticeable changes in the level of customer service and the overall layout of the restaurant it seems that the owners have missed an opportunity to enhance their profits by not considering the logistical aspects of the establishment theres room for improvement in this regard

one of the major changes i noticed is the declining level of customer service the staff appears to lack the same level of care and dedication they once had during a recent visit i brought some friends to experience the authentic haitian cuisine unfortunately i encountered an unpleasant situation when i had to return to the front cashier to make a change to my order despite clearly specifying my desired rice type the staff in the kitchen were rude and insisted that it wasnt on the receipt instructing me to go back to the front to pay for it this encounter left a sour taste in my mouth

furthermore upon reaching home and indulging in my meal i noticed a decline in the quality of the food particularly the beef as a lover of the legume ive been consistently disappointed by the dish at this restaurant in recent times

i truly hope the owners take note of these customer concerns and consider making changes to enhance the overall experience it would be wonderful if they paid attention to reviews like these i believe there are customers like myself who long for a return to the delicious food and enjoyable dining experience that this restaurant once offered",0.9905,Good

furthermore i am so pleased to say that the food was delicious generous portions flavourful and truly satisfying plus the bread butter and sour cream were all homemade im sure more was homemade but this is what we specifically found out was homemade ill post photos of what my husband and i got for reference

service is top shelf
portions are very generous
baton rouge has a rather unique system whereby the wait staff are constantly attempting to be aware of each others tables  what this means for the customer is fast efficient service  if your meal is up in the kitchen and your server is not there but another is  that server will bring it out to you  simple things like water refills and clearing dishes is rarely missed
for starters we had the calamari  it was cooked to perfection tender and crispy on the outside served with smoke show aioli the seared ahi tuna salad the tuna was meltinyourmouth delectable
the new york strip loin ordered rare was incredible
we also went overboard by adding a side of sizzling shrimp and scallops
the waitress maria was quick to ask if i wanted the steak off the regular menu  or the special upgrade that came with starter salad and the steak was topped with a generous slice of brie and pan seared mushrooms and accompanied with green beans and choice of second side
our meal was capped off with the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake to share
the prices are quite fair considering the exceptional service and generous portions  it seems rare that you can find a restaurant where the entire waitstaff seem happy to serve are very friendly and efficient in their work",0.9951,Good

the service was very slow slow to take orders slow for food to come slow to check back slow to get the check and slow to pay

had the oysters and mignonette as a starter and they were good  the main was the octopus and really the dish was problematic the octopus itself was chewy tasteless if not for a strong artificial smoke taste  it came with a caponata that had never heard of sicily and a tasteless artichaud puree

95 percent of the food is locally or regionally sourced and therefore fresh and tasty  presentation and service were also impeccable

the menu is very traditional and delicious
the wine pairing was good too and when i personally did not like one wine they kindly replaced it with an other wine

once we arrived we were very rudely spoken to by one of the staff members tall guy with a long beard i think he is the manager there the service was zero to nil once our orders arrived the waiter was literally tossing our plates in front of us and whenever we would ask them a question we were spoken to with complete rudeness and a lot of side eyes

we were a group of 8 people everyones orders arrived at 316 pm sharp my order was missing and did not arrive until 330 pm the level of rudeness that the waiters had was actually through the roof

the food the sodas the customer service the setting i give it a 010 there was one lady who gave us our receipts to pay she was amazing actually but that was it

if you ever visit quebec city do not go to this restaurant or be prepared to leave disappointed

be dressed cleanly as its attached to a nightclub and come early around 10 to have a table vibe is on the formal side music selection is good and performers generally had good voices but you could barely hear the person singing over the music track the place is loud in general so if youre looking to chat another venue might be more suitable there was an abundance of quebec music the night we went it took about an hour and a half between being listed and actually singing

the comment from the restaurant is really disappointing im not suggesting they have discrimination the service was poor because we understand french language although we used english to communicate it was obvious that we even raised our hands and waved to our waiter a couple of times we were ignored on top of that they didnt take care of guests food intolerance and lead to very bad food reaction

the place is packed during brunch hours id recommend making reservations days prior to the visit
the view and ambience was great it took about an hour for the whole deck to turn 1 round
the brunch options were great
however the food and drink were underwhelming the smoke salmon was way too salty
the service was horrible to non french speaking guests it was obvious that our waiter was much more welcoming to the french speaking guests around us while ignoring us 80 of the time
i had food intolerance and asked to have all the sauce and salad dressings on the side
they only put the hollandaise a side but still served the fully dressed salad i had really bad reaction to the salad dressings afterwards it was painfu caused me headache and swollen tongue lt took me a couple hours to recover
we also had steak and eggs he didnt even ask us how we would like our steak
the coffee and tea were cheap and awful the fruit bowl was soaked in syrup everything was either too salty or too sweet
it kinda put the whole experience a shame the place was beautiful but i was expecting a much better food quality and service",0.0516,Bad

it was quite a long wait at the doorstep before staff noticed someone was waiting there afterwards it became an exciting entrance as i went straight behind the curtains opening into the kitchen where staff made a welcoming greeting and then i was ushered straight to my table

the amuse bouche were flavourful but lacked the element to amuse the mains were filling but nothing  extraordinary they have an interesting midcourse bread refill with three separately served butter flavours perhaps a strategy to allocate space in your tummy they have a unique play on their petit fours a la buffet which was set at the bar it was an interesting tasting menu but flavour entertainment needs to be elevated

it was a fun kitchen visit with the whole staff and the chef and managed to sneak a photo with them gladly offered by one of their staff

fine dining newer style
great team that seems to really works well together
the tasting menu was delicious
the wine pairing was a hit or miss we appreciate they journey off the beaten track but still expect the wines to be delicious or at least be enjoyable with the course referring to the quebec wines as these were def not our favorites

also 7 courses is 7 courses with 7 wine pairings unlike other restaurants in town

the friandises with the coffee or the cherry on the cake

overall can highly recommend and hope to come back one day",0.9722,Good
Laurie Raphaël,French,"117 Rue Dalhousie Quebec City, QC G1K 9C8 Canada",QC,46.8170574,-71.202684,5,"my wife and i had terrific dinner at laurie raphaël i had reserved a table on the terrace but asked the host for a table inside due to the gloomy weather thankfully she was able to accommodate us

as a gastronomic restaurant laurie raphaël does not disappoint every part of the dining experience is very well thought out and executed

the host led us through the restaurant to our table surprisingly the first part of the restaurant that we entered was the kitchen where chef raphaël vézina and his chefs all stopped whatever they were doing and greeted us with a hearty bonsoir the entire space is beautiful and modern

after we were seated and enjoying a cocktail the complete tasting menu was explained to us my wife and i wanted to enjoy a lighter dinner on the final night of our first ever trip to vieuxquébec so we chose the fivecourse menu personnalisé over the full eightcourse expérience gastronomique i also chose to have the wine pairings with my meal

the food was terrific inventive and delicious we really enjoyed the pairing of cucumber with caviar and the textures and flavors of the lobster course were fantastic i only wish that i had been offered some bread to soak up every last bit of the sauce there were no missteps with any of the dishes which were all delicious ill post photos

the wines were chosen playfully and from all over the world i particularly enjoyed the il roccolo di monticelli di rado which transported me back to venice

at first i worried that the service would be less convivial than i prefer the staff appeared to have clearly defined roles some set the table others delivered the food and others cleared the table however there was one gentleman who came by to introduce each course and showed great humor when i asked him to do it in both english and then french and finally both english and french at the same time

as tourists the only part of our meal that was lacking was a clear connection between the food and wines to the locality we travel to eat and experiencing the terroir is important to us i was hoping for a more clearly québécois meal for example the cheese option for the dessert course was a play on carbonara a flan of egg louis dor cheese and guanciale while the cheese is from québec i felt like i was in rome instead of québec

as i said however this feeling is particular to us as tourists as a gastronomic experience our meal lacked nothing and would stand out anywhere that we have been in the world",0.9983,Good

the tablecloth was dirt it was not worth it mentioning because when i noticed we were already so disappointed by the service that we just rolled eyes

i think the administration of the restaurant should consider hiring extra servers for the lady who was serving us had at least 40 clients to take care of when the recommended limit is 20 it just took her too long to come see us to refill water to just pay attention to our table

Picaro Cocktails & Tacos,Latin American,"101 20th Street W Saskatoon, SK S7M 0W7 Canada",SK,52.12582,-106.67062,3,"did the wednesday date night dinner and our server was the sweetest  she is very friendly genuine and answered all of our questions

all of our drinks were beautifully made and well balanced

we were a party of four and did 1 date night dinner which included salsa trio and chips green papaya salad and we chose 2 orders of the rogue tacos chef rotating creation and an order of churros  we also ordered 2 orders of chicken skin chicarrones 3 fish tacos 3 pork tacos and 3 shrimp

so the pico de gallo was delicious but the other two salsas was not our favourite  the roasted shishito salsa was really bitter  and the spicy peanut one was a nice slow heat but nothing memorable  the chips were hit and miss with the salt level  and the green papaya salad was bland  of course everyone has their own taste but when i see a green papaya salad on the menu i think of the thai style full of chili salt sugar and funky fish sauce

the star of the show and what i completely recommend is the chicken skin chicarrones  it came with a honey and aleppo dip  i wish that was the dressing on the papaya salad and were so crispy  we ended up dipping those into the salsa trio too

churros were hot and fresh and one order comes with 4 churros  the dulce de leche sauce was served warm

server was friendly and got our orders through  asked for a recommendation and the royal bangkok bowl is what i settled with  my wife had the chicken enchiladas

we started with the lettuce wraps which were okay  it only came with 3 pieces of lettuce so that was a bit of a disappointment as we had to ask for more  as compared to other places like the cactus club i would give them a 610

my wife really enjoyed her enchiladas  i did get to try a bite and it was good

however i did not enjoy my royal bangkok bowl  i dont mind spicy but this dish was a bit too much for me  it was a bit bland tasting  after a few bites i mentioned it to the server  her solution was to bring me more water but that doesnt resolve overly spicy food  in all honesty i would have preferred if they were willing to accept an alternative  i am assuming most restaurants would be willing to send it back to the kitchen and provide a different meal  i would have been more than happy to pay for it

i dont usually like to complain but i did mention it to our server  she didnt really think anything of it and kind of brushed it off  i can appreciate that there isnt a whole lot they can do but i really felt that it wasnt a big deal to the staff

i always finish my meal or get it packed up  i left more than half the meal untouched as i just couldnt eat it  i tried but literally left the restaurant hungry

just a bit disappointed as i come from an industry that customer service is vital for our success and i felt like i was being brushed off  i could understand if the restaurant was extremely busy and they were just unable to accommodate for my situation  however the restaurant was a bit slower wednesday evening which would have given them ample time to find a resolution

my advice listen to your customer and at least attempt to provide a viable solution  i never would expect anything for free and would have been willing to pay for an alternative meal

Restaurant 224,Chinese,"224 3 Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7K 1L9 Canada",SK,52.1262547,-106.6628915,5,"went in here for my first meal in saskatoon after a long day of flying and being awake for over 15 hours at that time the restaurant was my first stop before exploring the city
thr atmosphere inside is quite nice a lot more spacious than it appears form the outside looking in
the gentleman who sat me down was very helpful and had great attitude recommending dishes whilst chatting a bit too he was very much on top of his duty and checked in with all the tables consistently to provide water and services
the food was quite nice nothing over the top but very delicious and the selection combining vietnamese with other east asian dishes meant you have lots of options to select from
id definetly recommend visiting this place as the service speed of food and taste all but makes for a nice experience
also the prices are pretty cheap compared to toronto so even though there may be less asian culture in saskatoon the food was also a lot cheaper than the hundreds if not thousands of restaurants in toronto lol",0.9835,Good

secondly we had a relatively large group which they were nice enough to accommodate however since many of us ordered the same thing the waitress was very rude when i tried to verify with her if she was giving me my order i asked for an extra runny yoke on my poached egg but other people ordered theirs medium she insisted the one she brought out was mine but lo and behold i cut into the poached egg and the yolk is cooked all the way through i dont know why she was being so unnecessarily stubborn

now the reason for 3 stars the waitress attending our table was extremely slow we were there for a mothers day celebration with 8 people on the saturday but there was nearly no one in the restaurant maybe 2 other tables aside from ours there was 4 drinks that were ordered and it took 45 mins for the drink to finally come out by this time she hasnt even taken our order we tried to stay as patient as possible but once we notice an hour has gone by without any food coming out we notice another table that came after us already ordered and had there food before us they were another table of 5 and came approx 1520 mins after we arrived

once the food finally came out our mothers order was still wrong and we politely  requested to unfortunately send it back and have the correct dish made the waitress then made a comment saying im pretty sure you said this dish but ill get it changed anyways in a bit of a irritable kind of way

my son for the new york strip medium well  its usually exactly how he likes steak  however this new york strip is cut in half horizontally  so its very thin unlike a regular thick piece of new york strip meat  so cooking it to medium without much pink  its like rubber i cant recommend this cut  the photo showed how thin they slice it  its like half the thickness of a regular piece of meat  my son got the plate and was likeso someone took the top layer  very disappointed young man

my sirloin was medium and a normal 8oz you would expect  my only complaint was the amount of pepper  its very heavy  i didnt order the peppercorn steak  it would have killed me  i cut the top layer off my steak to be able to eat it  my side selection was the baked potato with just butter  it was as expected just very small for the price i expected better

we were too full for dessert so got it to go  the chocolate cake and billy miner pie both were taste lasted that evening  it was hard to select deserts as they were all great choices
