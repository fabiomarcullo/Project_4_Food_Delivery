Restaurant Name,Rating,Review
Wendy's (10365 111th Street),5,The food met my expectation. The seating area was clean and comfortable. The staff member who helped me was wearing a mask. It was difficult to assess her demeanor but over a nice person. I am happy to recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.
Wendy's (10365 111th Street),2,"It's a Wendy's, their food is good. Better than McDonald's usually. That being said, you're probably wondering: ""Ok so why a 2/5?""

Here's the thing, they miss items in orders rather often (often as in 95% of the orders I've made here have had missing items or been just completely wrong)
Of course, the reason for this issue could be any number of things, it could be point of sale or just lack of coordination or anything else. All I know is that this has not improved with time.

I just want my darn large chocolate frosty, it's on the receipt, there's a spoon in the bag but no frosty to be found.
I don't know what I should expect continually ordering here but I just want the friggin frosty I ordered I mean seriously that's THE item Wendy's is known for, it's printed down on the receipt, it's the only cold thing, it's in a cup as opposed to metallic wrapping the food has. There are infinite opportunities to notice ""hey there's something missing here""

The only reason this isn't a 1/5 is because their food is good.

...
I just want my Frosty man."
Wendy's (10365 111th Street),3,"I love the taste of this food as it tastes like there is some realness in this brand of fast food.  That's not to forget it's still fast food! When it comes to fast food places I choose the establishment similar to making a choice in a dilemma. As far as the atmosphere well, it felt like everyone was in a dilemma and stress was aparent. I think ive had more stress free visits at Wendys considering  that the crowd was less  Conscientious or more hungry."
Wendy's (10365 111th Street),5,"This is the best Wendy's I've ever been to. Incredible. There's a reason why they are rated 4 stars (which is about as high as a fast food chain can get). Fast service, no mistakes, great managers who actually help employees and the food is always hot and fresh. This is a very high volume location and they have their act together. Great job to all the workers here including management and ownership."
Wendy's (10365 111th Street),5,"I been here so many times. I never had a problem. Yeah, there are sometimes homeless people inside, but I don't think it bothers anyone. It doesn't bother me."
McDonald's (Garneau),3,"People were nice, Fast service at the drive thru. My kid had to go to the bathroom, I regret going inside. I took a couple of photos after flushing the toilet because I didn't want to see what I saw there again. I think a restaurant is firstly judged by its bathrooms. Come on guys, it's embarrassing."
McDonald's (Garneau),4,"During the Pandemic, ordered a Big Mac through the Drive Through!  I was craving one!  Overall, service at this restaurant is very good!"
McDonald's (Garneau),5,"I recently visited this McDonald's  and had a great experience. The staff were friendly and attentive, and my food was prepared quickly and accurately.

The restaurant was clean and well-maintained, with plenty of seating available both inside and outside. The ordering process was easy and efficient, and the menu had a good selection of options to choose from.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this McDonald's location to anyone looking for a quick and satisfying meal. Whether you're on the go or looking for a place to sit down and enjoy your food, this restaurant has everything you need."
McDonald's (Garneau),1,"I dont know what the people working there were thinking. How do you keep a straight face to receive the pay check when you cant even fill the half of a large fries. Its called large fries not half fries, if you do not wish to work at mcd then pls just leave stop scamming every customer with ur attitude and ability to giv zero f abt the amount of foods given. Bringing bad reputation to this mcd is what ur doing, good job."
McDonald's (Garneau),1,They dont even give dipping sauce for the chicken nuggets and forgot to bring drinks that we ordered and there's literally soft drink in the mcflurry.
Subway (230 10111 104 Ave),1,"Went to try a rice bowl and ended up witnessing a street person who was quietly sitting suddenly erupt into a huge coughing fit of phlegm and spewing blood. Poor subway artist sandwich girl tries to call security and no one came immediately.  I stuck around and ended up buying the bowl from the blood spattered scene because I felt bad the worker would get fired after she explains to her manager that the customer lost his appetite witnessing the horror show.   I was so hungry that I tried to take a bite of the steak-bowl but after chewing and reflecting on the dark red bbq sauce, I tossed it.

Also the tomatoes and lettuce looked limp and sad.  1 star for her corporate response."
Subway (230 10111 104 Ave),3,Most of the time its alright but lately they have been serving stale bread for there subs. When i take a bite out of a sub i expect to take a bite not naw at it in order to enjoy it like a well done steak. Dissapointed with this location lately.
Subway (230 10111 104 Ave),4,Newest Subway in downtown.  Great new revamp of their logo and signage.  More modern decor.  Good service that was friendly and helpful.  I have visited Subway many times over the years and have always enjoyed the food.  I like the new soda dispenser and the great selection of pop flavours now available.  The store is well lit and clean.
Subway (230 10111 104 Ave),2,"Usually I have no issues with this location - the staff are very friendly and quick. However, I ordered the chicken noodle soup on October 21 and I‚Äôm now battling with food poisoning. The chicken seemed a bit off after the first bite, so I didn‚Äôt eat anymore of it - only the broth and veggies. Will never get soup or poultry from any Subway location ever again."
Subway (230 10111 104 Ave),4,"It was a fairly decent subway, however they put extra cheese and charged me for it even though I never asked. I would go back again, just be make sure this time they don't do that [ $1.60 for 2 slices of cheese is crazy ]"
Burger King (13338-137 Avenue),5,"We haven't been to Burger King in a very long time, but that is now going to change. The burgers were excellent,  the fries were hot, and there was very little ice in the drink.
We frequented the  ""golden ****""  fast food restaurant and we just assumed that their products were the ones for us. We were wrong. Burger King is now our ""go to"" restaurant."
Burger King (13338-137 Avenue),1,I ordered whopper meal for me and veggie burger for my wife . Whopper was good but veggie burger was totally waste of money and health . Half cooked and taste was so bad.
Burger King (13338-137 Avenue),2,"A disappointing visit. To preface, I hate pickles, so I requested no pickles on my burger. Got pickles anyways. Ask for remake, and they took the pickles off and gave the same sandwich back to me but in a new wrapper. Missed giving me fries for my son‚Äôs combo. Not worth the effort to complain to the aloof front counter managers."
Burger King (13338-137 Avenue),5,"Always a great experience at this location. It's definitely a child friendly business and good value for the money.

The food is standard fare for a Burger King but what I feel sets this location apart is the staff who always provide a positive customer service experience.

Highly recommend."
Burger King (13338-137 Avenue),4,Haven't been to Burger King in a long time and was pleasantly surprised. Burgers are still huge (got the whopper) better fries than most places and very nice workers at this location. Not to mention for $11 I couldn't finish my meal so it's good pricing too. Definitely going back!
A&W (82nd Ave Edm & 101 Street),3,"The food is great but sadly I felt so dirty at the window and the humanity from inside the window needed their spirits uplifted. They didn‚Äôt seem too happy inside üòû

Love the foods, the root beer, the shakes, the deals and the vibes‚Ä¶usually."
A&W (82nd Ave Edm & 101 Street),5,I still love A & W's breakfast.  I now get the discount. So an All Canadian breakfast with a large coffee. All for under 10 bucks. How could one go wrong? Eggs are always cooked the way you want them to be cooked. After you order grab your coffee and go have a seat they bring your food right to you. Another reason I love this place.
A&W (82nd Ave Edm & 101 Street),1,"If I could give this A&W no stars, I would. I have ordered here many times and the last 3 times I have, they have messed it up so badly. I have severe allergies and have made this clear in every order and still they have messed it up. Genuinely afraid to order from here anymore. I have wasted so much money and Whenever I‚Äôve tried to go back to get a refund there‚Äôs never a manager there so nobody is able to help me. Managers are only there during hours where I have class. So overpriced and terrible service. DO NOT ORDER HERE."
A&W (82nd Ave Edm & 101 Street),5,Friendly service and good food. The coffee was very good as well. Nice and clean inside.
A&W (82nd Ave Edm & 101 Street),1,"I stopped in briefly to use the washroom well I was waiting to catch the bus downtown the staff member was very rude to me. I even offered to leave my bags at the front to try and address any unanswered concerns.
She immediately locked the bathroom door. Told me I had to make a purchase to be able to use the washroom. This is not what A&W advertises themselves as. They are supposed to be a family. What kind of family refuses to allow there loyal customers to use the washroom? Very dissatisfied with my interaction with this employee.

Update: the manager came out and rectified the issue immediately once she was made aware of the situation adding a star back ü§ç"
Harvey's (109 St & 104 Ave),5,"Honestly, see how hard you guys work and  I just wanna say I really appreciate y‚Äôall, and the fresh food that you guys prepare by order. I was watching them handle rude and impatient customers and honestly my heart goes out to y‚Äôall. You didn‚Äôt conflict, instigate or escalate the situation you handled it all very well. Some people are just so used to the consumer life. Keep smiling and doing what you guys do, I appreciate the quality"
Harvey's (109 St & 104 Ave),2,I'm happy its open 24hrs since I went there 1:30am. Staff was great and the only thing that I don't understand is the dine in situation. Open 24hrs but can't sit and eat your food after a certain time.. that's the only thing I dislike and disagree with. I'll go back one day and around the same time and see if dine in available then if so I'll change the stars to 4 or 5 depending on how I get served.
Harvey's (109 St & 104 Ave),5,"Best Harvey‚Äôs in the country. The staff are extremely well trained, helpful, and generous with any toppings you request.

I attribute this to the ownership and management. I‚Äôve been going to this location for over 25 years under the same management. They care about the food quality and customer experience. Best value for breakfast hands down. And no other fast food restaurant offers such a diverse selection of side orders and combo flexibility.

If you love Harvey‚Äôs you MUST try this location!"
Harvey's (109 St & 104 Ave),5,"I been going to this location so many years. Its the one around near my work. I have never had a problem here.

How do you have a problem at Harvey's? It's Harvey's, you even get to choose your toppings. If you want more or less toppings, they will do it for you. Every Harvey's I been to. I have never had a problem. The west edmonton mall location, the 170 st location and even when they had one in the home depot on 137. I never once had a problem."
Harvey's (109 St & 104 Ave),4,"Food was tasty, smaller burger than they used to be, but good. Staff were nice, they could clean a bit more in the dining area."
Denny's (10803-104 Ave NW),5,"Came here cuz I was craving diner food. First time at Denny's, and it was awesome! Food was delicious and well-portioned for the price. Their menus are full of variety (drinks/snacks, food, and dessert are all separate) and glad to see that they cater to dietary restrictions. Service was top-notch and everyone was friendly and energetic. (FYI for Americans: they accept Discover Card!) I understand the hype around Denny's. They're open 24 hours, which means you can grab your late night greasy spoon fix. Impressive overall for a franchisee. Definitely come with family or friends."
Denny's (10803-104 Ave NW),5,"I ordered the American slam, cinnamon pancake breakfast and coffee; it was all delicious and, it was all brought out very fast. Vijay was my waiter, he was friendly, diligent and provided service with a smile. Overall, a great meal."
Denny's (10803-104 Ave NW),5,"Everything was excellent. They were accommodating and treat us nicely. Food was also very good, along with our very nice server Tess! :) Would come here again for sure!"
Denny's (10803-104 Ave NW),5,"nice place, not too crowded. great service. thank you to our accommodating server Thess.
had a hearty bfast here.üíú"
Denny's (10803-104 Ave NW),5,A great meal this morning at the most reliable Denny's in town! Great service courtesy of our server Amanda. Will be back soon! Really enjoyed the Bourbon Chicken Skillet.
Ricky's All Day Grill (Jasper Ave),5,"I tried their vegetarian burger option, which had blonde based patty and let me be honest with you guy the burger was basically as big as my face üòÇ, that thing was huge
The other thing that really caught my attention was patty mixed with veggies ‚Ä¶. Most of the other plant-based patties that I have tried are mostly juicy but this one was a little bit crispy on the outside and then very soft on the inside and then I also Got tomato soup on the side ‚Ä¶.. it was tasty too
shout out!!!!!! to my server SARAH she was super nice‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ and the overall atmosphere was really good. Highly recommended 8.5/10"
Ricky's All Day Grill (Jasper Ave),5,Fabulous breakfasts!  Huge! I asked for my hash browns extra crispy! And the delivered! I had the works omelette. Super tasty
Ricky's All Day Grill (Jasper Ave),3,Was quiet which was nice. Soup was cold but good. Fish&Shrimp platter was good.   Clubhouse was good. Service was nice.
Ricky's All Day Grill (Jasper Ave),5,Came here for brunch and there was ample seating and the staff here were so nice and personable! Had such a family restaurant feel to it. Tons of choices to choose from as well!
Ricky's All Day Grill (Jasper Ave),3,"I have been coming here for years and it is very good. I will definitely come again. It‚Äôs good for a couple or a larger group.  Food was tasty. Service was fast and courteous although it took a little while longer than expected for the food. Prices are reasonable. I love it that breakfast is available all day. Had the eggs Benedict with spicy chorizo and liked it.
February 24, 2019
We‚Äôre back for Sunday breakfast and enjoyed it, although once again we had to wait longer than anticipated.  It was busy but it should not have taken almost 45 minutes for our order.  Today I had the steak and eggs and it was okay, the hash browns were mostly cold so was the toast.  Quality is good and service was friendly and courteous.  Coffee was warm. So  overall it was okay."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (10041 106 th Street NW),5,"Food was great and service was fast. Some homeless dude outside kept yelling swear words which kinda dampened the mood, but that not Cora‚Äôs fault. Great spot for a good breakfast. I had the pancakes and they were huge, definitely worth the money compared to some restaurants."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (10041 106 th Street NW),2,"I made an order for delivery this morning - it was made and delivered in a timely fashion. The banana-mango smoothie was fine, but not worth the $7.00. The major problem was with the blueberry pancakes: they had only 7-8 blueberries each, which is very frustrating as the whole purpose of ordering blueberry pancakes is having blueberries in the pancakes. So, that wasn't great. Next, I stopped before eating even a quarter of one of the three pancakes. They did not have the taste or texture of pancakes. I can only describe it as what I imagine trying to eat a soft sponge would be like. Completely inedible.

It's a shame, because Cora is one of the few places I know of that offers blueberry pancakes, and I've enjoyed them before. But I'm honestly not sure if I'll ever get the memory of how bad this order was out of my head enough to try them again."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (10041 106 th Street NW),5,"Brilliant brunch spot in downtown Edmonton! They are super busy as it is near the entrance of the hotel so they have local and travelling customers.

Even with the high demand, the staff is efficient and provided well-cooked eggs.

Highly recommend this spot!"
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (10041 106 th Street NW),4,"I was in Edmonton for the Garth Brooks concert and stayed at the hotel with this restaurant at/in it. I had breakfast there twice, two different options, the Eggs Benedict and an omelette. The fries were actually potato wedges and I felt they were surprisingly good for simple potato wedges. The Eggs Benny had a lot of fruit for garnish including a cantaloupe slice, strawberry and Apple. Overall, both breakfasts were good sized and filling and I would  have liked to have seen the omelette be seasoned (salt/pepper) at the time of cooking but it can be added by the customer.

The only con such as it is, I am used to low priced breakfasts and the prices here were kind of dear for breakfasts but the quality was there and I wanted to go back.

It appears to be a ?family? run restaurant, I am guessing here, but I got along with the servers and actually chatted with them both days. Had a fun time. The decor is simple as in not much but the food quality was high and the labour in the food prep showed that the overall restaurant quality is worth the visit

Definitely can recommend to have breakfast there"
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (10041 106 th Street NW),5,"Wonderful Food Especially for Breakfast!! I enjoyed my Food a Bunch! And the Waiter was really nice! Always Saying ""Thank You"" That was so Lovely of Her! May Everyone Here have a Great Day! Thank You!! üòä"
IHOP (3921 Calgary Trail),4,Our server Greta was absolutely lovely. Very professional and equally friendly. Made everyone feel welcome. The food was good and reasonably priced. We did have challenges hearing each other over the noise in the restaurant. Not much they can do about that.
IHOP (3921 Calgary Trail),4,"The food was excellent. We went in there for a Breakfast. They had Protein pancakes option so ordered that. It had the right amount of sweetness. Had there been a little more cream on the top, it would have been perfect.
The Chicken Fajita omlette was amazing as well.
All in all a good place for breakfast if you want to go for a balanced meal."
IHOP (3921 Calgary Trail),4,"Wanted to try the IHOP here for awhile , pretty decent overall experience but the food lacked a finesse I was looking for. At these price points I would expect better quality , especially the Benny's. Whoever poached mine did a terrible job at it. There was hardly any of the white left in the egg , probably swirled around too much. Failed to impress !"
IHOP (3921 Calgary Trail),1,"Very bad experience, my food had 2 hairs going through my omelette. 2nd hair found by the server himself lol. My 'chicken' omelette had no chicken inside. I didn't get pancakes as I ordered instead they gave me a fruit bowl, so obviously wrote my order wrong, or wasn't listening.
It used to be my fav goto place with guests and family but unfortunately with their quality so down... I doubt I'll bring my guests here. Sad to see this place going downhill so fast. :("
IHOP (3921 Calgary Trail),5,"Love the healthy option for breakfast. The server was awesome, and knew the menu well for me to make a decision.
$59 for breakfast includes tip!
Food was fresh and good."
IHOP (15130 127Th St),2,"My husband and I decided to have breakfast at ihop yesterday and how disappointing!  The host that took our name was rude and had an attitude.  Although that should have been a red flag for us we stayed and waited to be seated.   We were finally seated and was even more disappointed at the dirty table we were seated at.  Thank goodness our waitress was kind and friendly.  She took our orders and brought us coffee.
I ordered 2x2x2 which was well made and my husband ordered an eggs benedict which was made perfectly.
I don't think we'll go back to this location.   I would rather dine and support a business who hire and train hosts who greet people welcoming not rude and abrasive."
IHOP (15130 127Th St),5,Amazing. Great food. Of course it's a family restaurant so there is alot of noise from the children. But worth the food portions and taste. My server was Adriano. He's awesome. Works hard. Hope you get him and tip him well.
IHOP (15130 127Th St),5,"Great family place. Our server, Fenisha was wonderful. She was attentive and made sure we were enjoying the meal. There was a problem with one order that she fixed quickly and pleasantly.

They were out of a couple of things but there were plenty of tasty alternatives. Recommend to anyone!"
IHOP (15130 127Th St),1,"The past 4 times our group dined here, our food was lukewarm, bacon was greasy, and eggs were cold. They certainly do not know how to even make the food look appetizing!
Not sure if it‚Äôs under new management but certainly something has to change. Please serve your food hot."
IHOP (15130 127Th St),5,"The restaurant was quite busy, but there was lots of staff, and our food came out quickly. Our server was attentive.
The last time I was at an IHOP, the cinnastack pancakes looked a little different. They must have altered how they did the cinnamon spread. But they were still delicious."
Tantalizers African Express,5,"Really enjoyed my stay the owner was very nice and helpful
Next time I visit I will surely go back"
Tantalizers African Express,5,I really enjoyed myself and I will surely be coming back
Tantalizers African Express,1,"I wish I could give this business a zero. I placed an order which they confirmed with me over the phone. I arrived and they said they did not get an order.

I drove 25mins to get a bad service from them. The staff were giggling and told me they did not have my order.

They were confused, rude and unprofessional. I won‚Äôt be coming back. This is one major reason such restaurants never really grow past one location. You can‚Äôt treat customers poorly and be okay.

I was poorly treated and the staff did not even care if they made a mistake to record my order after I called over the phone.

Best believe I won‚Äôt be coming back, ever. I‚Äôll take my business elsewhere."
Tantalizers African Express,1,"I had called to make an order. The person on the phone was quite rude and couldn‚Äôt offer any recommendations, or explain in further detail. Saying she ‚Äúhad lots of people to order‚Äù. I understand times can be busy but to be rude and not take customer phone calls is quite unnecessary."
Tantalizers African Express,1,"Horrible customer service, with nonchalant staff. Placed an order, was given a time for pick-up, arrived at the location and they suddenly had no idea what the order was."
Langano Skies Ethiopian Restaurant,5,"You have got to try this place!
We had family visiting (from another continent) and, as a part of experiencing Edmonton, decided to sample a fusillade of great cuisines that the city has to offer. After three weeks of eating out family consensus went overwhelmingly in favour of Langano Skies as the tastiest food we have had during the visit.
Stop reading this and order from Langano Skies!"
Langano Skies Ethiopian Restaurant,5,"The service we had here was absolutely phenomenal. Gave great explanations, recommendations and was keen on our needs.
The food itself was delicious! I've had Ethiopian food before but only at festivals. Communal eating and eating with your hands is pretty dang fun.

Overall I'd recommend to come here with a group to get the full experience. Highly recommended!"
Langano Skies Ethiopian Restaurant,5,"5/5. One of my greatest discoveries for food!!!
A quiet place with good ambience, very friendly staff! Food is exquisite (extra star if you are fond of spicy food), generous in quantity (portions), and reasonable price for all the above combined! It is definitely an experience. Friday night combo (vegetarian) is a must try! Ethiopian Coffee and KATEGNA is highly recommended. They patiently and passionately walk you through menu, and explain what to expect- Extra star for the service."
Langano Skies Ethiopian Restaurant,5,"Langano Skies was delightful! Sad to see an Edmonton staple go‚Ä¶ The environment is welcoming and charismatic. The service was extremely attentive and kind! Shout out to Emma! The veggie sambusa was the best way to start the meal! But the special tibs, yebeg wot and atekilt aletcha wot were so delicious!"
Langano Skies Ethiopian Restaurant,2,"Family owned restaurant, super friendly. However, price doesn‚Äôt do justice with the quantity. I think it‚Äôs somewhat pricey with what they offer. Taste is okay. 7/10. I ordered 1 red lentil entr√©e which was 18$(which should be 10-12$) and chicken curry for 22$ was too oily and less curry(which should be 16-18$ )"
Taste Blends,5,"Taste Blends is the place for authentic Kerala food. Their buffet is the best Kerala buffet I‚Äôve ever had!!! Chicken Biryani, Raita, Mutton, Rice and Paneer butter Masala too for the veg option. Must come and try it. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Taste Blends,5,"Was invited here for a date. Love trying new foods and was excited to try a new place. Though I have no pictures of what we had, doing my best to keep my phone away, I did get a few pictures. We had the Rava Masala Dosa and the Kuttanadan Prawn Dosa. Love eating with my hands and these two were amazing. The flavors were exciting and the food was soo well done. We then enjoyed a masala tea.
We had the place to ourselves but I got the impression, that if the place was full, we would have been given the same amount of attention. Excited to return and try more on their menu."
Taste Blends,5,I really enjoyed the Food and taste were awesome. The owner is great at customer service.   Everyone should try their food. They don‚Äôt compromise with the taste. I will visit once again to try some other dishes as well.
Taste Blends,4,"When I left from Qatar, my 1st restaurant here was the best South Indian cuisine in Edmonton. It tasted food and good service. I love the staff always smiling."
Taste Blends,4,"Very good choice of dishes and they adjusted the spice level for me which was something very few Indian restaurants do. The meals were large quantity and good quality, friendly staff, quick service and nice atmosphere"
Fine Pizza & Donair,1,Worst chicken donair i have had! that star is there by default but does not deserve one . waited over 25 mins burnt fries burnt chicken n burnt taste
Fine Pizza & Donair,4,"I got a friendly greeting over the phone when I called to order a pizza pickup.
I think I waited less than two minutes for the food when I arrived.
Drove to my buddies place and dove in.
Very good pizza and not shy with the toppings!
They didn‚Äôt skimp on the cheese or sauce without over doing either one.
I‚Äôll definitely be back.
I would have posted a pic but we ate it up before we had a chanceüòÑ"
Fine Pizza & Donair,5,Amazing food! Bought a chicken shawarma poutine and it was the biggest poutine I have ever had...Will definitely be a regular after our experience.
Fine Pizza & Donair,1,"It was so bad i asked for a lamb shawarma, he gives me 2 pieces of lamb  when i went to pay he clicks on the 2$ tip button without asking me the rice tasted like really watered down uncle bens with this weird noodle in it the hummus had little to no flavor, after all of that the salad was lightly seasoned with so little dressing. Rip 25$"
Fine Pizza & Donair,5,"Looking for a late night Donair? Come see these guys. Food was great, service was prompt, and prices were reasonable. I had a large Donair combo and was not disappointed; the Donair was well wrapped, the meat was fresh yet nice and crispy and full of flavor, had sweet sauce on it and it was consistent all the way through, even though at the bottom of the plastic bag was covered in sauce drippings, the Donair remained whole and did not fall apart, the portion was generous as well. The fries were well seasoned although Cavendish fries are my favorite at Donair Joints; overall, good food, service and price. I will come back again."
Pho Hoan Pasteur (West Link),5,"This is the first time I've been to this location. It was very busy for a Wednesday.

The service was quick and very friendly. They accommodated us with last min changes and also checked up on us when they could.

Food was delicious. Green onion cake was very crispy. They got rid of little plates for dipping and instead went for paper cups.

Ordered number 13 and 52?  Flank, tripe and tendon was good texture. Not too chewy. Well balanced."
Pho Hoan Pasteur (West Link),5,"I recently visited Pho Hoan Pasteur in Edmonton and had an incredible experience! The restaurant is one of many locations in the city, but this one in particular stood out to me. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, and the staff was very friendly and welcoming.

But what really blew me away was the food. The pho was easily the best I've ever had in Edmonton, and their bo kho (beef stew) noodle soup was absolutely amazing. The broth was rich and flavorful, and the beef was so tender and delicious. I also loved the generous portions of noodles and meat in the soup. Don't forget their famous onion cake, good to dip with the soup!!

Overall, I would highly recommend Pho Hoan Pasteur to anyone looking for delicious Vietnamese cuisine in Edmonton. The quality of the food and the friendly service make this a standout restaurant in the city. I will definitely be returning soon!"
Pho Hoan Pasteur (West Link),5,Pho Satay is so good!! It's definitely one of the best Pho places here in Edmonton!
Pho Hoan Pasteur (West Link),5,"Noodles are delicious, love that all noodle items come in 3 different sizes, very economical for sharing. Good value for the portion size and generous amounts of meats. One thing that could be improved is to replace plastic bowls with ceramic ones. Not a very healthy thing to be placing almost boiling hot soup in plastic bowls."
Pho Hoan Pasteur (West Link),5,"The consistency is on point, you can come everyday and the taste is on point every time. Try everything... you will thank me later. Their ice coffee is the best ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

I recommend #16 and house special as well. The onion cakes are to die for as well. Their menu is full of surprises."
Palabok House,5,"Palabok House in Edmonton serves up a delicious variety of Filipino and Chinese dishes, with an all-you-can-eat option and a range of fruits and desserts to choose from. For a special treat, you can also order their famous halo-halo and of course ""palabok"". On Fridays, enjoy a lunch discount of CAD17.99 per head, making it an affordable option for families and friends. Kids under three years old can also dine for free. The authentic Filipino cuisine is sure to impress, and it's not just Filipinos who love to eat here - many other nationalities also enjoy the tasty food. To make the experience even better, the occasional live entertainment by famous Filipino bands and celebrities adds to the vibrant atmosphere."
Palabok House,4,Food was delicious except that the white rice was a bit too dry. Crispy chicken and pancit egg noodles were amazing!
Palabok House,2,"What started out as a nice evening yesterday ended up in a disaster.  We ordered three dishes and an appetizer and was reassured that none of them had shrimp in it.  When we received our Pancit Hab-Hab (#37), I noticed shrimp on top.  I told our waitress that we were given the wrong order as the dish we got had shrimp in it and it was not as described on the menu.  The order should only be pork.   She took the dish back into the kitchen and told us that this time there is no shrimp as the kitchen made a new one.  My fianc√© was the first one to dig in and he ended up eating a small piece of shrimp that was buried into the noodles.  He got extremely sick right afterwards.  We mentioned this to our waitress.  She felt terrible about the situation.  I told her that the new dish the kitchen made was still wrong as it also had chicken it.  Still not as described on the menu.  She told us that the menu has not been updated.  Please be wary if you have any food allergies or intolerances, as what is described on the menu may not be accurate.  We did not get charge for the dish.  We will not be returning to this place again."
Palabok House,5,"It‚Äôs the best I always come here with the 2 in one meal, I like all 5 dishes included in the price except for the rice.  The waiting is not bad, plus you can take out what cannot finish.  I highly recommend this restaurant, Filipino food is the best!"
Palabok House,5,"Palabok House offers delightful Filipino cuisine that will leave your taste buds satisfied. Their signature palabok dish is a standout, featuring a harmonious blend of flavors and textures. The dishes are prepared with care and showcase authentic Filipino flavors. It's a must-visit for anyone seeking a scrumptious Filipino dining experience."
Urban Plant Cafe,3,"I came in not knowing what Urban Plant Cafe was. I ordered a beverage and food but was told that they would take a considerable amount of time to make. When I asked what might be good to go without waiting 10-15 minutes but they didn't have a lot to offer at first glance.  The staff also didn't seem to be attentive.  I will probably have to come back in the future because the whole experience at this cafe was a bit ""confusing"".  I'll still give it three stars...the menu seems great and the space was clean and well lit.  Stay tuned.

Urban Plant Cafe,4,"If you're craving for some ice cream, I highly suggest that you take a trip down south of Edmonton and have some Korean Shaved Ice Dessert (Bingsu). Urban Plant Cafe has some great options for coffee but their desserts are a must. They're pricey but well worth it and you can share it if you like but once you have a taste of these little heavenly bowls of happiness you won't be able to stop eating them. Taro and Kong Bingsu are my goto, both have an Oreo layer in between and some Cornflakes underneath which you're able to have a little cereal at the end. Not overly sweet.

Also, there's a few more items here to be had such as the Mochi Cheese Pizza and the Macarons, but I mostly go here for this dessert.  I live on the Northside of Edmonton and I'm sure there other places that have it but the way they make their bingsu is pretty darn good.

The reason for the 4 stars is because their Uber services have too many complaints and its their drivers trying to cancel orders and get away with it. Management needs to complain that their drivers have to pay or commit to the order or else they are able to run away with your food.

TLDR; This little coffee shop is pricey but they have a great menu for desserts and should be in your goto spots for a late night craving. Uber drivers tend to cancel coming from them and they run away with your order late at night without any repercussions."
Urban Plant Cafe,5,"The macarons are amazing here and worth the price (somewhere around $3.50 each). Can‚Äôt wsit to go back and try the other sweets there! Also a very nice place to study at, there‚Äôs an okay amount of seating but we went when it wasn‚Äôt busy and it was perfect."
Urban Plant Cafe,5,"I visit this cafe every Saturday or any time that I have a chance to. It is one of the best cafes that I have ever been to. Their bingsu is phenomenal, the taste is amazing, and the texture doesn't feel like a shaved ice, but it feels like you're eating clouds that just melt in your tongue.The panini and croffles that we ordered were also amazing from presentations to taste itself. The best thing is that the prices don't match the food!! You get delicious food for less than $15!!

The staff is very friendly and very professional, if you can't decide what to order just ask them because their recommendations are all good for new customers.

The cafe itself was quite unique, I mean that in a good way. The cafe was clean and very welcoming. If you like plants and a chill cafe to go to, this is the place. It's good for dates and brunches. Also you can buy plants here as well.

Overall, it's an excellent cafe from service, food, interior design, and cleanliness. I'll be back for more bingsu!!"
Urban Plant Cafe,5,"Super cozy--beautiful plants everywhere, nice ambiance, great staff, lots of food/snacks to choose from. Loved their bingsu and lattes."
Mikado Restaurant (Westside),3,"I am a Mikado regular but first time at this location. As I waddled into the joint, my tummy growled in anticipation. The food? Reliable and tasty as always. The fish? Fresher than a sea breeze on a pirate's face. Desserts? Sweeter than Grandma's kisses. But the service? Started off frostier than a penguin's backside. they warmed up by the end but it is a little too late for me not to mind."
Mikado Restaurant (Westside),5,"We were searching a convenient sushi in West Edm for a take away and found this. We entered and they had a table so we stayed
We loved the food and the place. Clean, minimal, Japanese style. Fish was tasty and well presented
All the servers were dressed in Japanese style with nice Kimonos for the girls.
We loved it.
Only... no Ramen on the menu except for the frozen one for the take away."
Mikado Restaurant (Westside),5,After being in Edmonton for a long time I never thought to try this place my husband suggested that we try it and boy was I pleasantly surprised absolutely delicious üòã  will definitely come back
Mikado Restaurant (Westside),2,"Went to Mikado West tonight for dinner. The food was quite tasty, unfortunately the service was not what you would expect from a nice Japanese restaurant such as Mikado. My husband ordered a bento box, and a chicken udon. I ordered a Brad roll, a small salmon sashimi and a chop chop roll. Took a while for someone to come to our table at the beginning, then after we ordered, the waitress brought out all of my food one by one, about 5 minutes passed and then my husband got his udon. The bento took another 17 minutes to even come to the table and I was already almost done my food. Not once did the waitress come and check on us, and then we waited for another 10 minutes just to get the bill. Food was amazing, tasted great but if you plan on eating at the same time as your partner - you may be disappointed."
Mikado Restaurant (Westside),3,This location is not as nice as the south side. The food is great but it seems mikado is not as fancy as they used to be. They used to give you scented wet towel upon arrival to cleanse your hands before touching the menu. The peppermint scented cloth also added to the experience
Pizza Unlimited & Fried Chicken,1,Worst pizza I have ever eaten... pizza dough was COMPLETELY raw on the inside. Was as if they did not even bother to cook any of the pizza. Very oily on top of that. Ate two slices of two large pizzas and had to throw both of them in the trash. Disappointing.
Pizza Unlimited & Fried Chicken,5,Always a surreal experience. Hands down the best pizza and fried chicken in the city. I love a restaurant who cares and is consistent and this is one of them. The pizza sauce and amount is excellent. Cheese is never over cooked. Everything is amazing here and I hope edmonton never loses this gem. I have lived in this city for 7 years and I travel  from north to south at least once a month for this. Keep up the good work guys.
Pizza Unlimited & Fried Chicken,5,"Ordered a chicken meal with 2 salads. Was very fresh.. chicken was hot and crisp. Salad was fresh and cold. This is 2nd time we have ordered here.
We live about one half block from this location and they have offered free delivery..  which was a very nice gesture..but we didn‚Äôt think that necessary."
Pizza Unlimited & Fried Chicken,5,"Best donair pizza in town! Nuff said. We have tried some of their flavors and although they are good compared to other pizza chains, their donair pizza blows the competition away. And they do not cheap out on the toppings, one giant slice and you will be full."
Pizza Unlimited & Fried Chicken,3,Heard so many good things so I had to try. I was disappointed. The crust was the best part. Ordered 2 18 inch 5 toppers along with others. Got a meat pizza. Didn‚Äôt see or taste the sausage. The ham looks and tastes like bologna. Way too much cheese and the sauce had a funny taste. Sad to say I won‚Äôt be ordering again
Kingdom of Spices,5,"Foods are super good, especially the naan is amazing, worth my drive from the far south side.
Service is also great! Price is very fair.

Parking might be a bit of an issue, might need to walk a little."
Kingdom of Spices,5,"I have ordered take out from this restaurant on many occasions and most recently I placed a large catering order. The staff was great to deal with, they offered me a great price, my food was ready on time without any issues and the staff was so helpful in assisting me with loading up my order. My guests thoroughly enjoyed the food and we received many compliments. I would highly recommend this establishment for Indian Food based on quality of food, portion size, service - you cannot go wrong with Kingdom of Spice. Thank you all."
Kingdom of Spices,5,"WOW!!! What we ate was stunning, this is the most delicious Indian I have tasted . I have tried a lot of Indian food in the city, and I can say this is definitely the best I've ever had. Everything we tried was the best -- best samosa i'd ever had, best naan, best curry, best tandoori, etc. The value was also incredible, especially considering the quality of food we got. Still in awe over how good it all was. The presentation was beautiful, the service was very friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was very laid back and welcoming. We will be making many more visits, I'm sure. Even my normally very shy partner enthusiastically told our server it was the best Indian food he'd ever had. ü•∞ Highly, highly recommended!!!

Quick aside, the chicken alfredo pasta is incredible and has an Indian flare to it, super flavourful and my new favorite. I don't think anything on their menu can disappoint."
Kingdom of Spices,5,Food is incredible service spectacular setting comfortable I highly recommend giving this place a try for ur next Indian food dining experience.
Kingdom of Spices,5,This humble little place serves the best Indian food in Edmonton! I have gotten take out here and keep going back for more. Reasonable pricing and mouthwatering menu! Definitely a hidden gem!
Garlic & Greens,5,"Food was full of flavor, it have been really hard for me to find a restaurant that taste good and authentic,
I was glad my friends took me to green and garlic the food taste exquisite üòã
We ordered mix veggies and panner butter masala and butter naan and i high recommend all of these items
Waiting time is quite longer then other restaurants i have been too but its worth waiting"
Garlic & Greens,4,Food taste were average I enjoyed the Tandoori chicken it was good. The stuffing inside the chicken momo taste like the chicken seek kabab and the chicken seek kabab were salty and spongy.
Garlic & Greens,4,"The chicken biryani was amazing! It's the best one I've yet had. However, service was slow and dull, even though the place wasn't too busy. If you have a lot of time or patience, then this isn't really a deal breaker, but it could be better in order to get a five star rating."
Garlic & Greens,1,"I ordered chole bhature and both the chole and bhature were really cold . I understand it might have happened during delivery but the chole they are really the worst . Tastes like someone took ready to use chickpeas and put them in old leftover curry . No salt no spices nothing just the oil
Really bad experience"
Garlic & Greens,4,"We were looking for a new place to try out and found this on Google maps. The pictures looked promising. Also the menu had momos. We were craving momos for a while. The first impression was good, the decor was good too. We were welcomed by the server. She provided us the menu and water and we had to wait a bit longer than expected for her to take orders, especially since there were hardly any other new customers in the restaurant. Nevertheless the food came promptly. Rest of the service was to the point. We ordered the sharabi kebab, which was good but could be better. The store bought boneless chicken thighs were quite evident. The biggest disappointment was the fried chicken momos. I would rather call them ""momosa""  as they were samosas which looked like momos. Fried momos are steamed momos pan fried to give a bit of crispiness on the outside. And this was nothing like that. The masala tea was as expected. Overall it was an ok experience. Maybe in the future we'll go back and try some other dishes."
Nosh Cafe (North),5,"I have been to this location a handful of times and every time I am SO impressed! I have ordered to dine in & from skip the dishes before. When I ordered it to my home everything was still fresh & warm. I also received a free dish with a purchase over 35$ dollars so that was a great addition!

Their staff is extremely friendly & always has my order out in a timely manner. Every single thing I have tried from there has been so flavourful & they keep me coming back for more.

On top of all of this, I have dietary restrictions of no gluten & they have been able to accommodate me everytime. They have plenty of gluten free options & I have never had an issue with anything they have prepared for me.

This is a little place of heaven close to my home & I would highly recommend trying this place out if you haven‚Äôt.

Thank you so much for providing such great services Nosh Cafe!"
Nosh Cafe (North),5,"I stopped in here for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. The lunch combo was a great deal for the amount of food that was given. The portion was huge, flavours were excellent and the variety in the lunch combo was nice. The owner was so kind to me as well. Their tandoori oven wasn‚Äôt ready when I ordered so they made me roti to have instead of naan. Part way through my meal she came out with a huge basket of naan and told me to take it home! Great food and service. I will be back!"
Nosh Cafe (North),5,Glad that Nosh Cafe has now opened in the north Edmonton. Food is amazing. Must try Tandoori Chicken Wrap and Vegetable biryani.  Service is great!
Nosh Cafe (North),1,Went for lunch ..the sign outside says . Butter chicken and rice 10 dollars special  .we order  2 and when the bill comes it was 43 dollars.we asked why when it clearly says outside 10 dollar special . I was told that it was a misunderstanding  .clearly is false advertising. In my opinion it's not good to advertise something that is clearly a mistake. Not a good service at all. Don't recommend and definitely will not go back
Nosh Cafe (North),5,"My go to place for Indian takeout. Food is quick, delicious and very reasonably priced. Love the lamb biryani as my go to order and the dosas are good as well."
Rosso Pizzeria,5,"We went to Rosso's on something we read about for the restaurant.
Well, we were not disappointed one smidgen.
What wonderful food and service. Our waitress was the very best.
It was a great ""foody"" experience.
There were six of us along with a little baby, we had no reservations and were looked after very well. Ordered six different pizzas, it was a delight to the taste buds. Every pizza was a totally different taste, and all tasted great. The crust was amazing.
And did I mention the latte? It was right on the money.
We all left very happy."
Rosso Pizzeria,5,Can park in the dental office parking when the business is closed. Just remember to give your license number at restaurant. Great food. Love the beer selection. Friendly staff. Make advance reservations.
Rosso Pizzeria,4,"The atmosphere here is super nice and cozy, and a great place to just sit and chat. I came during a weekday for lunch so there wasn't very busy, but our food took almost an hour to come out. The pizza was very good, we got the  Margherita. We got the special pasta and it was on the pricier side for what we got and the seafood was just a smidge overcooked but it was still alright."
Rosso Pizzeria,5,"I made a reservation which , even being a tad late was honoured without issue, got advice on not getting a parking ticket , which was also appreciated.

Servers were very friendly and efficient and the food was absolutely 10/10. As well as being reasonably priced, hope to return soon !"
Rosso Pizzeria,5,"BIG FAN of rosso pizzeria. My bf took me here for the first time a few years ago and we decided to revisit after a whiles away.
We started with a brie and bread appetizer which was great, and had the AMAZING dolce emma pizza which is a must try when you visit. It may be little odd when you look at what the pizza is topped with, but I promise the flavours compliment each other perfectly and it‚Äôs definitely worth your while.
Will be back for another date night."
Seoul Fried Chicken (Whyte Ave),5,Seoul Fried Chicken has to be the tastiest most flavourful fried chicken places I‚Äôve ever been to! They definitely don‚Äôt disappoint! I ordered for pickup and the service was quick and ready as soon as I got there. I recommend the Cilantro Lime 5 piece set with Mac and Cheese pesto and a side of their home cut fries and corn fritters. Highly recommend eating here! ü§ôüèº
Seoul Fried Chicken (Whyte Ave),4,"Had the Big Seoul, came with 5 pieces of soy garlic chicken, thick cut fries, kale salad and a pop. Money to food wise it's one of the best value meals in the city. Soy garlic chicken was crispy,tasty and the soy garlic sauce they use is my favourite in the city. Dunking fries in left over sauce is delicious. My one complaint is all the other sides/side salads at SFC are just alright. I have tried most of the sides and most of them are fine but skippable"
Seoul Fried Chicken (Whyte Ave),4,"First time trying Seoul Fried Chicken. They had an interesting set up where you order on one end, and pick up at the end of a hallway. The food was worth the money. Will have to give it a try again in the future. Not a huge fan of the pesto macaroni salad? I think that‚Äôs what it was. It was a bit too green for my liking."
Seoul Fried Chicken (Whyte Ave),5,"Order from Skip the Dishes, and must say excellent chicken for a very good price. Chicken tastes fresh, not old or reheated, breading is crunchy, light and not too heavy or oily, and my goodness the hand cut fries are to die for. They have generous portions, absolutely delicious and a great price - what more could you ask for?!"
Seoul Fried Chicken (Whyte Ave),5,"Literally the best chicken I have ever had, my personal favorite is the garlic soy, but I have enjoyed every flavor I have tried.  Go early though, because they make everything fresh they tend to run out of menu items as the night goes on, especially on weekends"
Dil-E-Punjab Sweets and Restaurant,5,"Best Sweets
Fresh and yummy

Chicken Naan and Butter Naan
We couldn‚Äôt resist to take the picture, had to take a bite and then the photo."
Dil-E-Punjab Sweets and Restaurant,5,I always love coming here to restock my samosas stash.  The food is delicious and the people there are very kind and helpful. I love how they often sample things I never would have tried. It‚Äôs sometimes intimidating going in to authentic ethnic food places but here they are so welcoming. Thank you!!!!
Dil-E-Punjab Sweets and Restaurant,5,"Very nice restaurant. The food is absolutely delicious, and the staff provides excellent service. The owner is incredibly down-to-earth, and all the employees feel fortunate to have such a boss."
Dil-E-Punjab Sweets and Restaurant,5,"The Jalebi is OUT OF THIS WORLD delicious!!! Super friendly staff. I was offered a piece of this sweet and scrumptious delight while picking up an order. Went back a few weeks later and scooped up a bunch more. My new favourite treat!!! Run, don‚Äôt walk to go and try this place ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©"
Dil-E-Punjab Sweets and Restaurant,5,"1. Huge collection of sweets
2. 100% halal
3. Great customer service
4. Good parking arrangement
5. Motichur Laddu, Gajor Haluwa and Samosas were amazing and fresh.
6. Order over phone before, it will save you time as they prepare everything fresh.

Highly recommended"
The Buckingham,4,Classic pub fare and all vegan! It's always nice when everything is vegan - no need to decode ingredients and ask so many questions. The menu has good variety and the food is crunchy-salty-savoury in the best way and the drink list has several local brews.
The Buckingham,5,"Tried the Buffalo Mac and cheese, and a jumbo with cheese with garlic fries.  It was all very good, but I need to rave about the fries!  üçü  The garlic fries were maybe the BEST non-battered fries I've ever had!   Great meal.

*reviewed by an omnivore who loves food*"
The Buckingham,5,"This is a great place to catch some live music. The menu is vegetarian but as meat loving Albertan I'll be first to admit that all thier food is great.good food, good people and great bands make.great nights and unforgettable moments."
The Buckingham,4,"Ah, The Buckingham. If you‚Äôre between the ages of 18 and 32 this is probably your go to bar in Edmonton, and I don‚Äôt blame you. They host a lot of events here ranging from live music competitions to drag shows, and I appreciate that they try and cater to a large variety of crowds. I‚Äôve had a decent time whenever I‚Äôve been here and I like the style of music they play on Friday & Saturday nights where the main focus is having a drink and dancing with your friends. I haven‚Äôt tried much of the food so I can‚Äôt comment on its quality, and they serve a lot of local beers which I really appreciate! The service here can vary from incredible to less than incredible depending on the day and time that you arrive but - that is like most bars. If I‚Äôm on Whyte Ave and I need to stop for a drink, this is where I‚Äôm going 99% of the time!"
The Buckingham,5,"Night out with friends listening to live entertainment for Juno week in Edmonton , good beer and food, nice vibe"
Oodle Noodle (Terwillegar),3,"It was my first time at this location.

I tried the butter chicken poutine & butter chicken macaroni. The portions were TINY and half filled.. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was delicious but I feel like I should of had more.

The decor and everything in oodle noodle was very stunning and eye catching."
Oodle Noodle (Terwillegar),1,"Really disappointed with our experience with this location today. We ordered some food from here, and what we received was an insult to say the least. We paid for extra veggies and extra noodles, and definitely didn't get them, plus our boxes were only about 30%-40% full at best. We called the location to find out what happened, and the staff was unhelpful, and unapologetic.

We will not be ordering Oodle Noodle anytime soon, if ever again after this absolute gut punch of an experience. Not only did my Fiance and I feel cheated, and unsatisfied, we are still hungry after finishing the pathetic portion that was delivered to us.

Oodle Noodle? more like Boodle Noodle."
Oodle Noodle (Terwillegar),1,"Absolutely HORRIBLE experience of customer service particularly at this location of Oodle noodle. DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION if you want to end up making your day dreadful!!!

Firstly, its about the staff (named keyur) then food. Teach your staff at least how to handle a customer with bad experience at your store instead of shouting on them. I paid the full amount for which I didn‚Äôt even ordered and end up throwing it in the garbage. Definitely not gonna visit this store in future and stop others too. If someone really wants to try better go to the ellerslie location(polite and helpful staff). I am not here for any compensation or reward back. And no wonder why this location has very LOW RATING mainly because of their staff‚Äôs disgusting behaviour."
Oodle Noodle (Terwillegar),2,"Got order to go. Got to work no cutlery. Makes it hard to eat with fingers. Suggested pun of the month
"" Special box that's what my wife calls it. "" server looked at me like I had 2 heads. Don't think I will go back as lots of other places to choose from."
Oodle Noodle (Terwillegar),2,"I ordered spring rolls, deep fried wontons and Tokyo glaze noodles. Everything tasted off, like dirty fryer oil and food wasn‚Äôt very fresh. I usually order from the Ellerslie location, their portions are larger and the food is fresh/tastier. I‚Äôll stick to my usual spot going forward."
Remedy Cafe (Whyte Ave),5,"A perfect place to relax and reflect!  My personal Oasis!  Their menu items are awesome and delicious!  Add to that, their washrooms are most poetic üôÇ"
Remedy Cafe (Whyte Ave),5,"loved the hustle bustle vibe of this place. it was a full house on a weekday.
we had ordered kashmiri tea and ginger tea which was really good. it had a nice presentation and quantity was good too.
recommended for tea lovers."
Remedy Cafe (Whyte Ave),4,"Heard a lot about Remedy and wanted to give it a try, i was there later in the day due to which didn't face any issues with parking but due to the Caf√© being at a busy block, please beware about extra time being spent on that.

Moving on to the most important aspect, Food, i had Masala chai(3% Milk), Kashmiri Chai(3% Milk) and Samosas, i hold high standards for chai, i personally would have preferred the chai to be stronger as that's the way i like it, you can taste and smell all the spices this chai was induced in which is great, another good thing about this chai was that it's creamy and frothy, considering this all, i will rate the masala chai 3.5/5, kashmiri chai had lots of pistachios which might be bothersome to certain people but i don't mind that due to which i will rate it 4/5, Samosas here are a great snack not greasy like a lot of ther places, they were crunchy and the filling was quite generous, though the size of the samosa was small they still hold a higher rank in my books, i will rate it 4/5.

The ambience of this place is great, it's a quiet place and the staff is friendly.
Definitely will visit this caf√© next time I'm around."
Remedy Cafe (Whyte Ave),4,"The vibe is hep. We always come here for the Kashmiri tea. Tried the ginger tea yesterday and that was good as well. I am not a cinnamon lover but for those who do, it‚Äôs great.
The butter chicken and naan was also good and 1 portion was sufficient for 2 people."
Remedy Cafe (Whyte Ave),1,"The staff are not friendly and the place is so unclean. I got the worst Kashmiri Chai I‚Äôve ever had in any remedy branch. The added flavour kept clumping in the drink and when I threw it all, I found the remaining clumping powder as shown in the picture.

I hope this branch cares to make the place cleaner and the staff can smile a bit"
Tokyo Express (Oliver Square),5,"Just had the pleasure of eating here after being reminded of their buy one get one 50% drinks.

Mango/Passion Fruit & Mango/Pineapple were the available flavors...and mmmm they delivered.

Mike was the Chef and let me say it was a pleasure to eat his food. He was an amazing host as well came out to speak to me due to my dietary restriction. He catered a entire meal for me! So please never hesitate to ask what Mike can do for you! Call in advance would definitely help the process.

The manager was amazing, I was unable to get her name. She helped Mike create a meal for me due to just being familiar with some of the ingredients and I really appreciated that.

Not withstanding her great customer service to other patrons of the restaurant, Uber/Skip and Delivery drivers while we were there.

I highly recommend here if you want something small or a full out meal.

I had a Chicken Udon Soup made with custom broth while my friend had the mini dragon sushi (He professed the Orange fish eggs are delicious!)

Thanks Tokyo - We shall be back for your amazing love, hospitality and food!"
Tokyo Express (Oliver Square),5,Super delicious food and wonderful service too. I love the beef teriyaki rice bowl! The fresh cucumber is so good. They usually put thinly sliced carrots and spouts as well but I get it without (: green onion cakes are soo good and they come with a sweet chill sauce. It‚Äôs a nice place to sit down and eat in because it‚Äôs so spacious and chill. The delivery/takeout is always packaged well
Tokyo Express (Oliver Square),5,"The food was amazing (as sushi always is). We tried the dragon rolls which tasted amazing.
The staff was very friendly and accommodating. They also had old Warner Brothers cartoons on which the kids enjoyed. We will be back."
Tokyo Express (Oliver Square),5,Service and staff were very efficient and friendly. Food was excellent.
Tokyo Express (Oliver Square),1,"We have eaten at Tokyo Joes in Unity Square often. Today, I picked up 2 Bernal boxes to take out. I phoned ahead
1 not ready when I got there
2. I asked for extra ginger
3 she asked if I wanted wasabi. I said yes
4 got home, No ginger, no wasabi
5 salmon didn‚Äôt look like salmon, covered I. Sea salt
6 Oil was not a good oil, had fishy taste
7 poor presentation
8sushi ok but not as good as in store at 1:00 pm"
Pho Hoan Pasteur (Edmonton),1,"Restaurant was nice and clean. Staff wasn't too knowledgeable in terms of the menu, nor too friendly. Food arrived semi-warm, and gave me the wrong size of soup. Had to ask several times for a to-go container, as the waitress was too busy and kept forgetting. Restaurant seemed too busy for staff to properly take care of customers. 1/5 stars. The 1 star because the food was tasty and the portion sizes were decent."
Pho Hoan Pasteur (Edmonton),1,I love the pho over here. But it seems greedflation is in full effect here. They kept jacking up the price on extra large noodle soup to almost $20
Pho Hoan Pasteur (Edmonton),3,"Update - these are good people and they didn‚Äôt deserve the one star.  The wait was still long and time given not accurate.

Tough to give a one star because I love this place.  Food is amazing.  Called in an order for take out at 620 pm.  Was told pick up in 20 mins.  Arrived at 640 pm.  Was absolute chaos in the restaurant.   They lost the order.  Had to reorder.  It‚Äôs 710 pm and still haven‚Äôt gotten the order.  No issue waiting but at least give accurate times so your customers aren‚Äôt waiting."
Pho Hoan Pasteur (Edmonton),4,"The place is quite busy and the service is very fast. The staff is friendly and helpful. The menu offers a decent selection and is quite traditional. Apart for 2 items the place lacks good vegetarian options; however, their bubble tea is quite good! I would recommend this place, If you are looking for Vietnamese food at a decent price and fast service"
Pho Hoan Pasteur (Edmonton),5,Amazing Food Always!! Full of flavor ! Best pho place in the city! They have a great menu and great prices. You won't regret it at all!
Tapsilog Filipino Cuisine,5,"hidden gem!!! cozy and homemade feel. the food is super good!! we loved everything: the lomi beef soup, tapsilog, and pork sisig.

we never had filipino cuisine before and this was amazing + the people are so nice and friendly :)

would recommend for hole in the wall places & comfort food"
Tapsilog Filipino Cuisine,4,"We decided to try something new, and this local restaurant showed up on our search. It‚Äôs a small, four table establishment. They really like the all day breakfast, and it was the only menu item with descriptions. We have never had Filipino food before, and when we asked what they would recommend the waiter didn‚Äôt have an opinion to give us. The food looked great, and the flavours were evident in the sauces. The garlic rice was fluffy but not what we expected (topped with dried garlic bits). They did not offer drinks, but there was communal water (which we did not use due to the pandemic).
Would recommend going here for something different than the usual restaurant scene."
Tapsilog Filipino Cuisine,5,"We just went to this place today and people there are amazing and so friendly! I totally recommend it üëåüèª. Food is good too, price is decent, overall experience is great! Will definitely come back soon.üëçüèª"
Tapsilog Filipino Cuisine,3,"If it wasn't for the tasty food, I would have given this place a one star. We arrived at the restaurant at almost noon and ordered. Our order took almost 1.5 hours. Service was really horrible. Food taste great on the other hand."
Tapsilog Filipino Cuisine,5,"If you are looking for filipino food and the usual food we have , try their dishes , taste good , they have also have sumptuous lomi , would recommend this place"
Chicko Chicken Edmonton (southgate),4,"A small unassuming place but it is putting out some decent Korean fried chicken. Had the original flavour. The coating was nice and crispy and seasoned nicely. The boneless option is nice but with the smaller size of the pieces, it comes across as a glorified chicken nugget."
Chicko Chicken Edmonton (southgate),4,"This was a good fried chicken joint! I got the original and the cheese dusted ones, I found the cheese one to be a bit sweeter than expected, probably because it was some sort of cheese powder. Was a bit much by the end but I enjoyed.

The original was really good and I got a dip too. Will try a couple other flavours in future and bump to 5 stars if they hold up!"
Chicko Chicken Edmonton (southgate),5,"Excellent juicy crispy sticky fried chicken. Their boneless is so good, and service was nice. I would recommend take out, as the seating is pretty spartan"
Chicko Chicken Edmonton (southgate),5,"Who ever thought fried chicken can be this good. It's soo amazing and delicious.  Great price, very friendly service"
Chicko Chicken Edmonton (southgate),5,"Great chicken and professional service. Was recommended this place by a friend and thoroughly enjoyed my boneless chicken. All coatings are good, sweet and sour is probably my top but the cheese dusted ones are good too. If you prefer spicy I recommend the balek (medium spicy) as you can continue enjoying it without issue. The spiciest one is indeed very spicy, still good just might take you a while longer to finish. Only caviat is it is slightly pricy but in my opinion well worth it for a treat."
New Everest Indian Multi Kitchen & Bar,5,"Wow, had the Lamb Korma combo and it was delicious. Will definitely come back again. I only ate half and will keep the rest for lunch tomorrow"
New Everest Indian Multi Kitchen & Bar,4,Great place for a group to enjoy some delicious indochinese food. Ambience isn't that good but food is great for the price. The best mango lassi of all in Edmonton.
New Everest Indian Multi Kitchen & Bar,5,"We tried their veg Hakka noodles and Manchurian, it's really awesome and delicious. Best place to have perfect Indo Chinese food in Edmonton."
New Everest Indian Multi Kitchen & Bar,4,I really recommend this place! Everyone was nice. Food was great! Although tandoori chicken served in a iron plate which burned my hand! The place is clean and organized! No parking spot of their own as it‚Äôs in downtown! So we had walk a lot! Food was really great and good portion! Price was reasonable! But taste was more than the price‚Äôs worth! Washroom was clean! Server was nice! Skip the dishes is available for this restaurant!
New Everest Indian Multi Kitchen & Bar,5,"The food is fantastic and no matter what I order I am always delighted with my meal! I enjoyed every single bite of the meal. Servers are also great, happy and polite and they truly care about your experience. I recommend this place to everyone! I would like to come back here again and again."
Padmanadi  (Southside),5,"I'll start by saying.... I am NOT a vegitarian, vegan or anything of the sort, I love my meat ha ha.
This was some of the best vegan food I have ever had! Amazing flavors and really fresh tasting! The service was awesome! Nice clean spot. My only complaint would be I wasn't a fan of the chair I had, minor thing, but it just wasn't very comfortable for me."
Padmanadi  (Southside),5,"service - 10/10 really fast, it will kind of take 2 - 5 minutes for starters to be ready after order taken

price - $$

music is really calm

Maya and Adam are really nice and friendly. gives you really good recommendation.

chai latte 10/10 - froth not airy, dense (has quite a flavor unlike others which is just air), it has light and natural flavor which is really nice.

mocha - 8/10 its really good. you have to mix the froth to have much better taste. (dont be shy asking for teaspoon)

fried oyster mushroom 10/10 - smells like fried chicken, the taste is really good

breaded cauliflower bites - 9/10
- there is a bit of spicy kick, cauliflower is nicely cooked, taste better with the dipping sauce (sweet and spicy)

spicy & savoury eggplant 8/10 - much spicer than dipping sauce of cauliflower bites, there is a lot of bell pepper tho (be careful, there is one chili underneath otherwise you will be surprised why it got spicy so fast). its quite good to partner with cauliflower bites or fried tofu.

nasi goreng 9/10 - has nice flavor to it. not overpowering if you'll eat it with the entree. you could also eat it on its own which is great

ginger beef 10/10 - now we know why this is the best seller. it's not the same with the other ginger beef that you taste with other restaurants. this has flavor. you can taste some curry seasoning/powder to it but not that sharp that it will linger to your palate"
Padmanadi  (Southside),5,"Possibly one of the best restaurants in Edmonton. We went in for a late lunch. Adam served us.  What a wonderful person he was - professional, friendly, and patient. I‚Äôm not a huge vegan fan.  So, my wife suggested the place, I was a bit lukewarm. But the food has changed me completely. What an incredible authentic taste. The d√©cor of the place was also very inviting. I would live to be back."
Padmanadi  (Southside),5,"I‚Äôve eaten in a couple times here. It‚Äôs super cute in there and the staff is very friendly. I‚Äôve been vegetarian for almost two years now, and I have to say this is probably hands down the best vegetarian food I‚Äôve ever had. There is so much to choose from, from the menu. I ordered Uber eats today (chicken skewers, chicken teriyaki and the coconut rice) and they followed my instructions on which veges I wanted in my meal.
I highly recommend this restaurant!"
Padmanadi  (Southside),3,"We had 2 shareable protein entrees. Rice is a side with an added cost; brown, jasmine and coconut flavored are options. We had 2 servings of jasmine along with the spicy coconut eggplant and spicy chicken in Thai chili sauce.

We also had the very dense chocobrownie, it looks appetizing but you definitely need water during and after eating it; that aside, the overall flavor profile was nice.

The spicy coconut sauce and the chicken were the üåü in each dish for me. I'm not a vegetarian nor vegan but I've grown up eating it the majority of my adult life-- and those aspects were a hit for my palate.

The food was prepared nicely, it took about 20 minutes maximum to be served.

Note, the same chef prepares both dine-in and take out orders; it is not a large kitchen so patience should be exercised.

The bathroom, my mom says, was spacious and clean.

The dine-in seating was comfortable.

It was empty when we arrived but did not feel uncomfortable.

Service left much to be desired, the initial server was attentive and hospitable but she left soon after we received our food and was seemingly replaced by 2 persons; 1- who was tending to the register and assisting with take out order preparation and 2- a person who was glued to the phone and laptop.

We practically cleared our own dishes, had to keep going up front for assistance when we had questions."
Chettinad Aachy's,5,"The food was tasty, reasonable in price, and generously portioned.

Went here for dinner and we didn't expect a good amount of portion for the food we ordered... We got some masala dosa which is first for me, it's so good will be ordering them again next time... Kerala Porotta (üíØüíØ) dipped in Butter chicken and another chicken cuisine I forgot the name which is super spicy but the flavour was so balance. Will come back again!!!"
Chettinad Aachy's,3,"A good place to eat South Indian cuisine, I visit this place with my friends. I am a big fan of South Indian dishes. You can also try a variety of other items on menu and some days they do offer buffet meals on table but do check with them on the date and time in advance to plan accordingly. The space is neat and the staff is polite especially Mr. santro. overall a good experience. You may want to consider this place if you like South Indian food."
Chettinad Aachy's,5,Loved the food here. Idly was soft and fluffy. Felt eating in India. Sambar was exceptionally tasty. Loved the chicken Briyani and fried rice. Hospitality was awesome
Chettinad Aachy's,5,"Dosa, South Indian food if you were craving for a good place in the West end. Lots of dosa options. It's like Crepe with vegetables and dips/chutney."
Chettinad Aachy's,5,"The quality of the food they offer is really great. I ordered couple of varieties from their menu and they were all delicious. Would highly recommend if you're looking to have good food. Worth the trip.
The staff members are awesome there. Thank you for hosting my group."
Dagu Happy Cup Â§ßÈºìÂ•∂Ëå∂,5,"We've been here a few times and I'm glad the food is still very good but service seems to have come down quite a bit. It took a long time to get the food and it was always very difficult to get the waitresses attention.

Aside from the service issue we started with the pigs feet which was delicious. Personally this is not a dish I enjoy due to the many bones but it was very authentic to the real stuff in China and the Sichuan pepper flavour was spot on. Definitely a great choice if looking for the real deal!

For the noodles I had the tomato crossing the bridge which was delicious. It's not spicy at all but the flavour of the booth is amazing. All of the ""crossing the bridge"" noodles come with a side tray of vegetables and if you get the beef slices or other meats they come on the tray like in a hot pot. I get the meatballs though instead which are really nice and they come directly in the soup. The other soup we had was the fish one which again the soup was amazing.

The noodles are technically all you can eat but the bowls are so large you don't really need a second bowl of noodles and they don't actually taste like anything. For us it's all about the broths. Their bubble teas are also very good but take quite a while to be made. So overall it's worth it just don't go if in a rush!"
Dagu Happy Cup Â§ßÈºìÂ•∂Ëå∂,5,"Visit: July 2023, January 2023, December 2022

July 2023: Got the curry chicken rice bowl. It was okay, I wasn't really blown away by the flavours, and likely wouldn't get it again. There was a BOGO on bubble teas, so I got a strawberry Panna cotta with 30% sugar (definitely not sweet enough, and I don't like really sweet drinks) and the salted egg yolk milk tea (very unique flavours!)

I love Dagu Rice Noodle. They have a lot of great soup dishes and sides. If you go there, you know you'll be full when you leave.

When they had the offer for a VIP card, I knew I had to get it, and it was a good call for sure.

Their prices are very good for what you get, and on Mondays, they have $1 skewers which is pretty awesome!

Their soups are very flavourful and they don't skimp out on the ingredients. There's also unlimited noodles, so you can eat to your hearts content!

Overall, love Dagu and I usually think about coming back whenever I'm downtown"
Dagu Happy Cup Â§ßÈºìÂ•∂Ëå∂,4,"Came here for lunch, first impression of the restaurant is very spacious, clean and newly renovated.

Ordered tomato soup based noodles soup. It was delicious, the tomato soup based is very thick and rich. There are a lot of spices and tomatoes in the soup, has the right flavour.

Service was not attentive, I had to wait a while before they seated even there‚Äôs no one waiting in line and less than 5 tables with 3 servers."
Dagu Happy Cup Â§ßÈºìÂ•∂Ëå∂,5,"AMAZING AND DELICIOUS RICE NOODLES, FRIED CHICKEN AND BUBBLE TEA!!! 5/5

Not only does Dagu Rice Noodle offer unique noodle dishes not found in many other stores in Edmonton, but the consistency and quality of the noodles, and the flavour of the broth is unmatched! It‚Äôs very fun to come with family and friends and spend time dipping the different ingredients in the hot stone bowl.

Other items on the menu I would definitely recommend are the salted egg bubble tea (I know- but TRUST ME it will blow your mind) and the fried chicken.

The staff are also very friendly, so I have become a repeat customer!"
Dagu Happy Cup Â§ßÈºìÂ•∂Ëå∂,5,"My go to bubble tea place. They use all the real fruits. drinks are not overly sweet.

Mango sunrise is my favourite drink. I can have it everyday. All of their drinks are between $6-$8

Check out uber eats as they offer discounts often."
Masala Tree,5,Had the butter chicken and naan.  Absolutely amazing taste!  Very friendly and fast service! Thank you Masalatree keep up !
Masala Tree,5,"We ordered veg noodles,  Malai Tikka and Gobi Manchurian. Honest Review..
You guys are best in town. This is the second time we have got.  Hope fully our future experience for 3, 4... X.. remains same and you will let us be your loyal eater. Hope the Chef is always happy... Happy Chef= Happy eater"
Masala Tree,5,"One of my favourite restaurants and a hidden gem in town. Every time when I go there, I ask the server, owner, or whoever's available ""Why are you so good?"" Their food is huge in portion, packed with flavours, and freshly cooked. 100% recommmend everything on their menu, but I personally love their chicken Hakka, lamb biryani, garlic naan bread and mango lassi."
Masala Tree,1,"Went to Masala tree and ordered chaat papri and Spring roll. Chaat Papri was ok in taste and to my surprise it has cabbage in it üòï.
Later came spring roll and it seems they are from costco not made from scratch. When i asked the person working there he said they have made it in the restaurant, but it does not seems so."
Masala Tree,5,"ME AND MY WIFE COME TO MASALA TREE FOR OUR HUNGARY STOMACH, OH MAN WHAT A GREAT FOOD üëç WE ORDERED  SO üòã üëå TASTY AND DELICIOUS AND MASALA DOSA WAS SO  FRESH STAFF WAS VERY FRIENDLY SPECIALLY RAMAN AND PINKY SERVED US SO NICE THANKS TO ALL STAFF AND GREAT JOB üëç TO CHEF üë©‚Äçüç≥ WE WILL BE BACK AGAIN"
Mudpot Restaurant,5,"One of the best south Indian restaurant in the Edmonton. Must try any dosa with delicious sambhar and chutneys, Chilli paneer (or chilli chicken dry spicy), chicken chettinad curry, chicken 65 biryani."
Mudpot Restaurant,5,The chicken lollipop was so good!!! We liked the idli and dosa as well. Atmosphere is good.
Mudpot Restaurant,4,"I had mutton biriyani, chicken biriyani, chicken kothu, and masala dosa from here. Both Mutton and Chicken Biryani have a unique style, very mild flavor, and no resemblance with any of the other South indian style biriyani's. My recommendation is to add more flavor and reduce oil. Chicken kothu and Masala dosa are really good.
All together, it's a good place to try!"
Mudpot Restaurant,5,"Great place for South Indian food! Highly recommend their Dosas, Gobi Manchurian and Sambar Vada. The place has great service and the chef is very sweet as well."
Mudpot Restaurant,5,"Being from Southern India, found their Medu wada(uddin wada) with great flavour and crispy just right.

Dosa was pleasing, Sambar was delicious, Just like Darsiniiii‚Äôs or kanteens we find back in India.

Will come back when in Town. & Good service."
Siam Thai Kitchen,5,"Worth the drive! A hidden gem in an industrial area in North edmonton.  Food was absolutely delicious and well portioned (although I really wanted like 8 plates of the skewers xD). You could experience the layers of flavors with each bite. The service was attentive and very friendly.  We came right at open but as time progressed, they began to fill up. Try it out if you are in the mood for Thai and a nice drive!"
Siam Thai Kitchen,5,"Simply the best Thai food I've had in Edmonton. The quality and generous ingredients mixed in with great value, I don't think I'll ever cheat on Siam with another Thai restaurant. Red and green curries are like liquid crack, no lie. Siam Thai Kitchen is a must try."
Siam Thai Kitchen,5,"Siam Thai Kitchen is a hidden gem. My daughter and I went for lunch. The Pad Thai was delicious, perfect flavors and the noodles had a chewy texture unlike some noodles that are too soft. Both the massaman curry and penang curry (picture taken after we had a few spoonful) were tasty, abit on the sweet side but still delicious. Their house made chili oil should be bottled and sold. Yes, it's that good. Will definitely go again. The waitress was very nice and the cooks love to sing in the back. Restaurant is cozy and clean."
Siam Thai Kitchen,5,I love the food. It was well prepared and tasted delicious. It‚Äôs a great experience. The ambiance is very welcoming. The cashew chicken was amazing. I would highly recommend this place. I will definitely be back again.
Siam Thai Kitchen,5,A friend of mine ordered takeout from Siam and it was some of the best Thai food I've ever had. The pad Thai and red curry were especially delicious. I strongly recommend it and I will definitely order from here again!
Cosmic Pizza and Donair (Downtown),5,"Amazing pizza, donair and shawarma. We got there after hours. Pretty busy location. Good customer service. Chicken shawarma was on point and pizza was amazing. Everyone enjoyed food. Would come back"
Cosmic Pizza and Donair (Downtown),3,Thier meat pizza was sad got a 18 inch and I swear it had a total of 2 slices of sandwich ham and maybe 10 pepperoni slices very little bacon and the manager says that's how they make it bu thier donairs are bomb
Cosmic Pizza and Donair (Downtown),5,"One of the most consistently good late night pizza spots in town. The staff are way going and pretty nice, prices are very reasonable and the pizzas, as I said, are consistently good.

It's our go to spot when it's late, we're starving, lazy, and require tasty pies."
Cosmic Pizza and Donair (Downtown),5,The pizza was DELICIOUS! There were so many toppings and the service was Incredible!
Cosmic Pizza and Donair (Downtown),5,"got a flyer in my mailbox so i thought why not! got it delivered and it was 40 minutes early, even though they called and say it would be late. great pizza for a good price, 2 pizzas and 2 sides for less than 60$. definitely give the jalape√±o poppers a try üòÅ"
PrimeTime Donair & Poutine - Ermineskin,1,"I‚Äôm usually a fan of prime time my wife and I frequently order from the new Southgatemall location and have never had a problem until we Uber eats from this location. They totally mess up. Our order. Both salads were made exactly the same without saut√©ed veggies fresh onions put on both when only one was supposed to get fresh onions and totally didn‚Äôt put any banana peppers on it and when I call the store and let them know the guy that answers the phone just him blames it on his employees and that they‚Äôre new, which is very unfair! My wife and I tried to eat the salads but the meat tasted burnt and it was unpalatable will still go to primetime donair just not this location!"
PrimeTime Donair & Poutine - Ermineskin,1,"Had the worst donair experience of my life. Spent 11.15+ a tip on the smallest donair I have ever come across. It tasted alright, but didn't fill me up at all. I have been to many donair stores throughout the city, and I have never experienced this in my life. I opened the bag and headed right back into the store for a refund which was denied. Do not EVER eat at this PrimeTime Donair! I've had better experiences at any other shop. >:( Made my lunch hour frustrating."
PrimeTime Donair & Poutine - Ermineskin,2,"I've went to this location a few months ago and was impressed with the size of the large donair.  I could barely eat it all and actually took some home. But tonight we went and bought 2 - 14"" Chicken Shwarma donairs. I was charged for changing the sauce from garlic to sweet, charged for asking for the onions to be cooked not raw. Base price was $14.50 each but paid over $36 incl tip.  Got the 2 smallest donairs in my life! I like to support local businesses but I won't be back anytime soon."
PrimeTime Donair & Poutine - Ermineskin,1,Horrible.  Thought I was going to get to enjoy a donair but after I paid they proceeded to try to reheat few day old meat and when I asked for fresh off the rotisserie they said it was(then was was it cold). I asked for fresh and again they said no. I asked for a refund they said no.   I urge ppl to order from mikes or queens donair.  Absolutely No quality control.  And horrible customer service
PrimeTime Donair & Poutine - Ermineskin,5,The delicious food that I enjoyed so much.. it was really a wonderful experience at first time i tried.. also staff is so helpful and polite behaviour.. i personally recommend to try it.
Smokin' Barrels Cocina Latina,5,"I came to check out this establishment during my lunch break, because I heard such amazing things about this restaurant and I wasn't disappointed.

Upon arrival, I was greeted and seated by the staff. The atmosphere had a great vibe, and during lunch hour it wasn't so busy.

I ordered the don birria tacos, and they were absolutely delicious. Flavours were on point, and super fresh.

The broth that came with the tacos was slightly a bit more on the salty side, however it did compliment the tacos nicely.

Chips with salsa and guacamole were also very good.

Overall I highly recommend checking this place out!"
Smokin' Barrels Cocina Latina,5,"Unbelievable food from Smokin Barrel Cocina Latina 13119 156 St NW, Edmonton, AB T5V 1V2

Birria tacos with chips, patacones with chorizo beef, passion fruit juice, and Cholados El Tropical - Passion fruit mix, condensed milk, vanilla ice cream, kiwi, pineapple and mango."
Smokin' Barrels Cocina Latina,5,Food was tasty! I want to go back and taste a few more dishes. Restaurant is small but busy so maybe call for reservations or go on a more quiet time.
Smokin' Barrels Cocina Latina,5,"I love fish tacos and these are by far the best I‚Äôve had so far in Alberta!  They look like salad tacos but the fish portions are not small the sauce is perfect and I couldn‚Äôt stop eating the 3 leches cake to take the photo of how beautifully presented it actually was, it was so good!
You can see everything being made right there and it all looks so delicious I can‚Äôt wait to go back and try everything else!"
Smokin' Barrels Cocina Latina,5,"Amazing Mexican spot, loved every item. Had the nachos, horchata and Birria tacos. Love the fried taco tortillas. The horchata was the best one I've had in a restaurant till now in Edmonton."
Lemongrass Cafe,5,"Trying a new VN restaurant is always risky as I am very particular about the Beef sat√© soup, which is my go-to dish.

I was pleasantly pleased as it held its own among the other two restaurants I frequent for this dish.

The salad rolls are by far the absolute best that I have ever had! They held just as much in stuff in them as other restaurants, but they were wrapped so tight that they stayed together while eating them!

The atmosphere was nothing special. Simple tables and chairs with simple decore.

Service was good. However,  not having complimentary tea was strange.

Highly recommended!"
Lemongrass Cafe,5,The place has a great vibe and was packed with people. I discovered this place from recommendations on Reddit and it was fantastic. Everything we ordered was delicious. We loved the Satay noodle soup and green onion cakes in particular. Fantastic value for money! Will definitely go back to try more dishes from their menu.
Lemongrass Cafe,5,"Very cozy, friendly, and welcoming atmosphere. Wonderful multi-page menu with tons of options. Waiters were friendly and attentive and the food was delicious. The restaurant was very clean and nicely decorated. Great little gem of a locally owned restaurant."
Lemongrass Cafe,5,Decided to try this place last night as it's close to home. I got the Vermicelli bowl with Chicken and Prawns as they were able to make it gluten free! The chicken was so yummy and charred to perfection. The portion size was super big for what you pay for! Can't wait to try out some more menu items!
Lemongrass Cafe,4,"Great food, very good portions and good price. I come here every often as I work 2 minutes away. The one problem is the service is not the best. They just don‚Äôt care about customers. Specially the young lady she just not cut out for waitresses. But overall if you don‚Äôt care about the service and just the food. This is the right place to visit."
Tasty Indian Restaurant & Meat Shop,5,"We eat a lot of Indian food, but this place is definitely a hidden gem.  It has a meat shop, grocery store and a restaurant.

We ordered chicken lollipop, Mysore masala dosa, garlic naan, coconut naan, biriyani.  The food is very fresh- usually Indian food is very heavy on flavor and you can't taste the meat, but my 10 year old son is chowing down on the chicken lollipop and thoroughly enjoying the flavor.  He said it is delicious.  He also loves the garlic naan bread.  It's fluffy, and not overly chewy like a lot of other places.

Biriyani is stuffed to the brim- portions are so good- Big Bang for the buck.  The rice is not mushy like a lot of other places or overly heavy on spice.  Usually you eat two bites and you are done, but this has flavor and not only spice so I can eat more of it.

I luv dosas and butter chicken, and I love that the butter chicken isn't overly heavy and actually has chicken in it.

This new places are awesome!  We got to talk to the owners too and they are great people.

Definitely support local- they also deliver and have online ordering, so please avoid skip the dishes and support local DIRECTLY"
Tasty Indian Restaurant & Meat Shop,5,I am from Toronto and visiting Edmonton. Last night ordered dinner from this restaurant through DoorDash. Just loved their food and taste was awesome. Authentic South Indian taste. So today decided to visit the restaurant in person. Really felt a great hospitality by Venkat the owner. His other staff who attended us was so friendly and polite. Felt happy to speak in Tamil with them. Today they had speciality combo of chicken Briyani for Father‚Äôs Day. The quantity was great and even 3 people can have it. The mutton sukka was melting in the mouth. The porota and Salna tasted awesome. We ordered chicken 65 and one of the best I tasted. Their Gulab jamun should not be missed. I think it‚Äôs made of Kova and not the usual ready made stuff. Thank you very much Venkat for your service standards and awesome food. Wish you and your team the best üôèüèª
Tasty Indian Restaurant & Meat Shop,1,"I ordered a dosa and to be honest neither dosa nor the chutney or Sambar tasted fresh, everything was stale looked like it was cooked few days back, everything was smelling so bad I had some and got food poisoned, worst experience"
Tasty Indian Restaurant & Meat Shop,5,"Great tasting food and 'heat' levels can be adjusted to your liking.
It only has a couple of tables available which are used for waiting for your take away food to be prepared.

Love that they offer lamb and goat choices as well as chicken, beef, shrimp.

Very reasonable prices. Fast service."
Tasty Indian Restaurant & Meat Shop,5,"We didn't necessarily go in, but we got their food through uber eats. Saw they had a promo going at the time so we got their paneer butter masala (BOGO), butter chicken, garlic Naan, coconut rice, steamed rice, tandoori chicken, and lamb samosa. Seems like a lot of food, we know, but it's the weekend and we don't wanna cook for a couple days lol. We got the food cause, due to our baby, we had to leave a wedding reception early and we were gonna have indian anyways (fijian Indian party).
The samosa...so good. My husband doesn't normally like samosas but he loved the lamb ones and I did too! They weren't spicy like most restaurants have them. The chutney that came with it made it better. The tandoori chicken was okay, felt it was a little on the bland side, however, with the dahniya chutney, SO good. Butter chicken, always a good option, had a little spice to it which I didn't like too much, but still good with the coconut rice and helped to tame the spice down. Same with the paneer butter masala. Overall, my husband and I will definitely be trying to go to the restaurant/store since it's not too far from our home. This is now in our top 5 of Indian restaurants."
TasteBuds Hyderabadi Indian Fusion,5,"We are so happy we discovered this amazing restaurant. Took us back to our hyderabadi roots. The lal chicken, chicken 65, mirchi ka salan were so authentic. The biryani was light and flavorful. The marag was a tad bit spicy for us but tasted delicious. Awesome food, definitely going back for more!"
TasteBuds Hyderabadi Indian Fusion,5,"As an ardent biryani lover I was searching for a hyderabadi biryani and finally I found this place, which serves you the best hyderabadi biriyani in edmonton. The effort  they are putting for every single takeway boxes is really appreciated. Hyderabadi chicken dum biryani and the apollo fish biryani are the best as per my taste.
Continue the great work guysüëç"
TasteBuds Hyderabadi Indian Fusion,5,"On whim, got the chicken 65 biryani after a quick glance of reviews. I must say, it did not disappoint! The taste was absolutely amazing and the quantity was more than satisfying! Even the hubby (who is a very picky eater!)enjoyed it! The man who served us was super friendly as well! Will definitely be back to try other things on the menu! Thanks!"
TasteBuds Hyderabadi Indian Fusion,5,TasteBuds catered my mom‚Äôs 75th birthday.  Masi made it special as he came and set up our food table and made sure it was organized perfectly.  We had about 100 people and everyone loved the food and couldn‚Äôt stop raving about each dish. Thank you Masi üéâamazing food.
TasteBuds Hyderabadi Indian Fusion,5,"TasteBuds is a hidden gem in Edmonton. I am quite fond of North Indian food, Biryani being my one of my favorite dishes. One recent afternoon, I was searching on Google for an Indian or Pakistani restaurant that may serve decent Biryani. I came across TasteBuds's website, I had heard of ""Hyderabad"", but I had never eaten food from Hyderabad. Despite my skepticism, I took a gamble and ordered a ""dumm"" Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani. Much to my surprise, the Hyderabadi Biryani surpassed my expectations and I have been a regular patron of TasteBuds ever since. It wasn't a one-time fluke, rather the food from TaseBuds is consistently superb and surpasses that of any other restaurant in Edmonton that serves South Asian food.

Beyond the excellent food, the hospitality and service surpasses any that I have ever encountered in Edmonton or for that matter anywhere in the province of Alberta. The warmth with which TasteBuds management treats its patrons is a delight and attending their take-out venue is a joy every single time.

I have also tried the Haleem that is available on certain days of the week. Hyderabadi Haleem is also one of my favorite dishes. The menu is very extensive and I look forward to trying new items in the coming months.

I look forward to the day when TasteBuds will adopt more environmentally sustainable methods of serving its patrons, i.e. by way of using recyclable containers. I chagrin every time I carry out styrofoam and/or plastic containers out of TasteBuds. Hopefully, with time this will change and TasteBuds will become the best take-out restaurant that not only looks after its patrons but also the environment."
Y-Not Indian Bar & Bistro,5,"Went on a Saturday to celebrate some birthdays out on the patio. The place was clean and inviting. The food was exceptional. High quality, generous portions, excellent flavour, reasonable prices. Even the dishes and glasses were impressive. Will definitely be back. Thanks for a wonderful meal."
Y-Not Indian Bar & Bistro,5,"A very good dine and take away option for Indian and Chinese food in Edmonton. Its open until 2 AM, and has a patio."
Y-Not Indian Bar & Bistro,4,Tried their Paneer Poutine for the first time. I have to say it was very good. Slightly bit on the sweet side but after adding pinch of salt it was all good.
Y-Not Indian Bar & Bistro,4,"Heard a lot about the place and wanted to try with my family.
Went as  a table for 5, greeted us promptly and sat us opposite to a window,
Wish they had blinds to give us shade the sun was bright on and shiny
little uncomfortable,
The server took our order, for apps. we ordered soup ,veg Manchuria, chili chicken with garlic naan ,
They got the soup first we did asked. For split but they just got one full cup with empty on side no SPOON Not sure why they didn't split the soup in kitchen, was hard to split ourselves without spills.
Soup was great. We got the chili chicken but the taste wasn't that good, we had to return it as it had some foul smell.
Veg Manchuria- the  veggie balls are not deep fried enough, they were gooey .
Our naan was  never served with apps.
Upon reminding the server got us naan and a new fish dish replacing the chicken .
Fish was very good loved it
For main course we ordered goat biryani and chicken fried rice .
Biryani was okay the usual curry mixed with rice and they call it biryani .
Chicken fried rice had chunks. Of tandoori chicken. My wife asked me if I ordered the TANDOORI CHICKEN FRIED RICE .
I was shocked to see that, I was like they might have used left over tandoori chicken which was re used .
We packed the food and left with great 10% Discount which I returned in tips.
Good food cannot go with bad service and bad food can always go with good service,
The server seemed knowledgeable may be he was the owner. I wish him good luck and hopefully they are busy so that they can serve fresh food when we go back.
Cheers!!"

Had good variety in menu for appetizers/ shareables and Meals. Also have good options for vegetarians.
Loved it and definitely coming back with family.
Server was very polite and helpful too."
New Gurkha Indian Restaurant & Bar,5,The restaurant is very spacious. Clean and washrooms well kept. Waitress is very caring. We had Kadai Chicken and Rajma Masala. Portion size is very good and tasty. Coconut and Mango milk shakes we awesome. Parked in front. Saturday lunch time was not crowded.

New Gurkha Indian Restaurant & Bar,5,"I've been there 2x and the staff are so friendly and welcoming. The food is top tier!! I've had 4 different dishes and each of them are so delicious I wanted more; but not on a full tummy.  Fresh Naan bread was soft, fluffy and warm. I'm excited to go back again and again. Thank you for such an amazing experience ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Kathmandu rasoi Ltd,4,"Small and busy place. Friendly service. Had a very tasty butter chicken with saffron rice and pakoras as appetizer. Generous portion sizes.
Would like to come back and try a variety of their momo."
Kathmandu rasoi Ltd,5,"Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5/5)

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Kathmando, an exquisite Indian restaurant that left me completely enchanted. From the moment I stepped inside, I was greeted with warm hospitality and an ambiance that transported me straight to the heart of India. This review aims to capture the essence of my unforgettable experience at Kathmandu.

First and foremost, the culinary adventure at Kathmandu is an absolute delight for the senses. The menu boasts a diverse selection of authentic Indian dishes, each crafted with care and bursting with flavor. Whether you're a fan of traditional classics or crave innovative fusion creations, Kathmandu has something to please every palate.

The starters alone are reason enough to visit. The samosas, crispy and perfectly spiced, were a revelation. The tangy tamarind chutney that accompanied them added a delightful contrast of sweet and sour flavors. The succulent chicken tikka, marinated to perfection, was tender and infused with aromatic spices that transported me to the streets of Delhi. And let's not forget the fragrant and fluffy garlic naan, the ideal accompaniment to any dish.

Moving on to the main course, Kathmandu truly excels in its commitment to authenticity. The butter chicken, rich and creamy, was an absolute highlight. The tender chicken pieces were bathed in a velvety tomato-based sauce, delicately spiced to perfection. The aromatic biryanis, bursting with fragrant rice and tender meat, were a symphony of flavors that left me craving for more. And for the vegetarians, the paneer tikka masala, with its luscious tomato gravy and succulent cottage cheese, was an absolute winner.

What sets Kathmandu apart from other Indian restaurants is the attention to detail and the use of high-quality ingredients. Each dish is expertly prepared by skilled chefs who truly understand the intricacies of Indian cuisine. The dedication to authenticity shines through in every bite, and you can taste the passion that goes into every dish.

To complement the culinary excellence, the service at Kathmandu is exceptional. The staff members are knowledgeable, friendly, and always ready to recommend dishes or provide assistance. They take great care to ensure that your dining experience is memorable and go above and beyond to cater to individual preferences.

Lastly, the ambiance at Kathmandu is a testament to the restaurant's commitment to creating an immersive dining experience. The vibrant decor, adorned with beautiful Indian artwork, creates an inviting and cozy atmosphere. Combined with soft lighting and soothing background music, it sets the perfect stage for an unforgettable meal.

In conclusion, Kathmandu is a culinary gem that deserves to be celebrated. The remarkable flavors, impeccable service, and captivating ambiance make it a must-visit Indian restaurant. Whether you're a seasoned lover of Indian cuisine or a curious food adventurer, Kathmandu will take you on a flavorful journey that you won't soon forget. I can't recommend this restaurant enough and I eagerly look forward to my next visit to Kathmandu."
Kathmandu rasoi Ltd,5,"I recently visited Kathmandu Restaurant for the first time and was blown away by the quality of the food. The momos, in particular, were absolutely delicious and definitely the highlight of the meal for me. They were perfectly fried and had a delicious filling that was bursting with flavor.

But the momos weren't the only thing that impressed me. The rest of the food was also fantastic. The spices were well balanced and the dishes had a depth of flavor that was really satisfying.

Beyond the food, the service was also great. The staff were friendly and attentive, making sure that we had everything we needed throughout the meal.

Overall, I would highly recommend Kathmandu Restaurant to anyone looking for delicious, authentic Nepalese cuisine in Edmonton. The momos alone are worth the trip, but the rest of the food is also top-notch and the service is excellent."
Kathmandu rasoi Ltd,3,we ordered chicken chilli but we received veg Manchurian. 3 stars are given because of the delectable food and the speed of the service. but the professionalism should be there to get the customer back again.
Kathmandu rasoi Ltd,3,"We ordered chicken momo, Egg hakka noodles & chicken manchurian for take out. Chicken momo & Chicken manchurian were good but Egg Noodles was little bit dry. You will get 10 pieces of momo in one plate.Their quantities are good & prices are quite reasonable."
Soban Sushi & Asian Taste,5,"Came here for my birthday everything was very good, really like it is both Japanese and Korean so that my kids who don‚Äôt eat raw enjoyed some cooked meals. The salmon belly was so good, they gave me extra on the house as well."
Soban Sushi & Asian Taste,5,"Tried this place for the first time for lunch. Thoroughly impressed. My fav dishes are the chop chop sliders (very unique), salmon belly aburi, butter fish aburi, tuna sashimi, and toro sashimi (tuna belly). The above mentioned were melt in your mouth. No stringy texture. Good sear flavour from the aburi. Got a complimentary salmon belly tataki too, which was also very good. Would definitely come back!"
Soban Sushi & Asian Taste,5,"Good assortment of rolls and their sashimi tastes great! We had their deluxe sashimi and had several different fish to taste. I usually compare the taste of the salmon as it's my favourite ‚Äî one of the best I've tasted in Edmonton. Fish was fresh and full of salmon flavour! For rolls we had the Crispy Creamy Salmon Roll which had cream cheese in it and it tastes splendid with the salmon. The black dragon roll also tasted great and the masago/fish eggs made it more fun to eat.   If you like smoky-tasting pressed salmon sushi, this place has it down! Takoyaki is different from other places I've been too. This one is more crispy on the outside but still warm and creamy on the inside.

We were two people coming in without a reservation and were seated very quickly. There is a good amount of parking space outside so I don't expect it to be all parked up even when it's busy. The restaurant was very busy when we went and there were children running around, but the staff were very patient and professional and managed to make sure everyone was taken care of :) Overall a great experience and one of the top Japanese places I've been to in YEG. We will be back for sure!"
Soban Sushi & Asian Taste,5,"I‚Äôve been wanting to stop in for a while and finally had an opportunity to do so before a meeting nearby.

Highly recommend the Black Dragon roll. Lots of flavours going on. The roll size and sashimi pieces were generous and fair prices.

Looking forward to coming back!"
Soban Sushi & Asian Taste,5,"Visit: February 2023

The Soban is one of the best sushi places in Edmonton (it's in the top 3 on my list). The food is spectacular, good portions at good prices. The staff is very nice and friendly and often provides some small bonus food (such as miso soup or piece of sushi). The staff is also very nice on each visit!

I've mainly had the sushi there, and the filling and fish to rice ratio is excellent!"
Royal Sweets & Restaurant,1,"Very bad service,the lady working there was so rude and also the sweets were not good. We got moong daal halwa but it seems they have mixed sugar in oil. We opened the lid and it's oil all over the halwa only and in taste it was only oil and sugar but no moong.

Also it seemed like they have microwaved the old halwa and gave it to us.

I highly encourage not to go there and order moong daal halwa specially the person's with heart disease."
Royal Sweets & Restaurant,5,Food was amazing taste was too good our all family enjoyed the food as that was for my daughters 1 st birthday party all our family loved the food best service
Royal Sweets & Restaurant,1,"I ordered smosa and bread pakora from them on 14 june,2023 !!  Stuffing smells very bad and mixture looks like 5 days old !! Please stop giving garbage food !!"
Royal Sweets & Restaurant,4,They have really awesome samosas. But some sweets were not that great. The Jalebi was not juicy at all. It was not fresh.
Royal Sweets & Restaurant,1,Food was good. Customer service was zero specially lady name  Kiran zero Customer service skill. 4 out 5 times miss onion on briyani.
Raja Foods,5,"We were on trip to Edmonton/ Calgary/Banff from Toronto, had lunch at Raja Foods on my friend‚Äôs recommendation and found the food amazing. Price was reasonable, food was delicious and service was good. Highly recommended for my GTA fellows if go on trip to Edmonton to add in their to do list."
Raja Foods,5,"Decided to go here for lunch with a friend. The menu is extremely good - lots of variety and reasonable prices. We went with meat samosa chaat, mixed platter which was boneless chicken and beef kebob as well as butter chicken with naan. I found the food ordinary, nothing extremely tasty or that I would run back for. The butter chicken was overly sweet and had absolutely no spices or chilli to it. The chicken and beef kebob were nice but again I wish they had some more spices and chilli to increase the taste. The samosa chaat was nice - it had some heat to it."
Raja Foods,5,"The flavors of the food were truly outstanding, surpassing my expectations. The service provided was truly commendable, leaving a lasting impression. The owner of the establishment genuinely embodies kindness and prioritizes customer satisfaction over profit, which deserves great respect. I am absolutely enamored with this place and wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone seeking delicious halal cuisine"
Raja Foods,5,Love the halwa poori here. One of the best in the city. Portions are great for the price. The chickpeas are perfectly soft. Good amount of spice in the potatoes & the poori  is super light and airy. Definitely recommend!
Raja Foods,5,"Full on desi halwa poori experience! Taste is to die for. If you are craving the halwa poori in the area, that's the place to go to!!"
11584 Burger King (6049 Young Street),3,"Place was empty aside from an Uber eats delivery driver waiting for an order. Focus was on the drive through and I waited at least 5 minutes before I was even acknowledged. At least they apologized for the wait, would have been better if they sounded like they meant it. My fries were fresh, the whopper was a little disappointing. Looked like it had been sat on and in no way resembled the picture on the wall....The left hand menu screen above the counter was defective, so Menu items 1 to 7 were a complete mystery."
11584 Burger King (6049 Young Street),5,My partner and I went through the drive through tonight and came home to discover our whole order was incorrect. When we went back the lovely woman working the window was so helpful in getting our food replaced and even gave us a complimentary pie and beverage. Its one thing to make a mistake but its another to know how to fix it! Thank you so much!
11584 Burger King (6049 Young Street),1,"Insanely expensive fast-food for subpar quality. They charge HIGHER than A&W prices yet do not have the same standards of food they sell, never, ever again. I shouldn't be gasping in shock at their ridiculously expensive costs and immediately wishing I went to McDonald's or A&W instead."
11584 Burger King (6049 Young Street),3,"Bacon cheeseburger looked amazing in the app but was disappointing in reality. Extremely expensive for a small child sized burger.

The Whopper I usually get is great but very expensive most of the time. It seems this location opted out of Whopper Wednesday on the app this week but it may still be available in store. It was available for me in app last week and it was a good deal then.

Onion rings and chicken nuggets are pretty great. Nuggets are usually a great deal. I keep missing the sauce for the onion rings all the time. Need to ask for zesty every time and I always forget.

Shakes are great but again expensive. Wendy's let's you swap in a Frosty to without paying $2-3 extra. Even the plain ones are difficult with a straw so get a spoon.

Jalape√±o Cheesy Bites are amazing when hot but sadly often come pretty cold and are also super expensive.

Washroom is disgusting. Nothing flushes and is overflowing and reaks. They didn't even have soap last time. Use the washroom before coming here because it's that gross. I need to pee often and it can't be helped. It's a good thing I like the food because eww."
11584 Burger King (6049 Young Street),1,Toilet is not attached to the floor .. and cashier on july 4 2023 is touching and parking food with dirty gloves from using cash and bit changing them.. called manager to tell them.. and she said it's because they are short stuffed..  then  hung up when I told her it's illegal to do that short staffed or not... I am putting in a formal complaint tomorrow am.. and the chicken nuggets are dried out and burger had a 7 inch hunky of lettuse core in it..  grosssss
McDonald's (Kempt),3,"Staff are great , good food but app us too convoluted. Instead of you deciding what I can use my rewards for, let me. I'm not going to buy something  because it's in the reward offers when I don't want that item. Also not everyone is computer savvy. Simplify the app. It takes too long and holds up people behind one."
McDonald's (Kempt),5,"I won‚Äôt ever forget one specific time I went for my daily Double Big Mac with Thai Sauce and extra McChicken sauce with a side of Large Fries and Mayo to dip. It was a cold rainy Tuesday afternoon and I walked in to see a blonde bombshell standing at the cashier and greeted me with ‚ÄúHey there, Welcome To McDonald‚Äôs‚Äù. I have never felt so seen in my life. I proceeded to ask the friendly cashier what his name was to which he told me ‚ÄúI am Aidan‚Äù. As he took my order, we hit things off. We spoke for hours about the way he grills the Pattys and how he assembles the food. I was in awe of his astounding customer service and friendly aura. I highly recommend this McDonald‚Äôs and to request Aidan."
McDonald's (Kempt),5,Who let the dogs out? This McDonald‚Äôs sure did. Man am I not sure about how I feel about nationalism but this poutine rattled my bones. The dogs can‚Äôt stop barking.
McDonald's (Kempt),1,"The slowest McD nationwide.Period!
Nicely constructed and decorated. But I would give ZERO star for the service and the speed. It is not acceptable to wait for a junior chicken for 15 minutes at 10PM where you are the only customer. Similarly waiting for 20 kinutes to get a breakfast bagel meal and at the end you hear the bagel you ordered is not available.

Another breakfast order with the same waiting time (20 minutes) and you are asked to go wait in mobile order parking! Not only this but poor customer service from some (not all) of the staff especially where you pay for your order (window1).

I have been to many McDs in more than 7 provinces and by far this is the slowest.

McD must look at how this franchise works if they want to retain customers."
McDonald's (Kempt),2,"Edit: I have to update my review. I try to be understanding given the pandemic and folks are not paid enough to be working at a McDonald's right now, but the order mistakes and poor food assembly is getting worse.

Okay so. As the closest McDonald's to me that's also 24/hr, naturally this is my favorite. However, it isn't uncommon for orders to get mixed up and some of the late-night customer are...rowdy.

Still, tons of parking, a split drive-thru, and the McDick's food quality is a winning hattrick"
Wendy's (3580 Kempt Road),5,Loved visiting Wendy‚Äôs. We‚Äôve been to this particular place twice already and both times were satisfied with everything. Wendy‚Äôs is much cleaner than any McDonald‚Äôs and the food is much more tastier. Loved having Dave‚Äôs single for myself. Will definitely come back for more :)
Wendy's (3580 Kempt Road),5,Great Wendy's location. Looks like seating area was recently renovated. Loved my Baconator and fries combo! üçü  ü•ì ü•ì
Wendy's (3580 Kempt Road),4,"I recently had a meal at Wendy's and it was just as delicious as always. The staff were very friendly and welcoming, which made for a pleasant dining experience. The restaurant was very clean, which is always a plus in my book.

One of my favorite things about Wendy's is their Coke Freestyle machine. I love being able to mix and match different flavors to create my own unique drink. The machine always works well and produces some very tasty beverages.

Overall, I had a great experience at Wendy's. The food was tasty, the staff were friendly, and the restaurant was clean. I would definitely recommend Wendy's to anyone looking for a quick and tasty meal."
Wendy's (3580 Kempt Road),1,"We waited 35 minutes for our food. They forgot to make it, then laughed at us. They spoke Indian in front of us. I demanded the money back and free food. They were willing to do that and apologized. Got home with our food only to discover that they gave me a chicken burger instead of the hamburger I ordered.  I phoned to complain 2 days later. The manager was very nice and is sending us coupons."
Wendy's (3580 Kempt Road),1,"I was kicked out because I brought in my electric scooter without my bike lock and I didn't want to leave it unattended outside.  I immediately went to the McDonalds up the street and they didn't say a word about it.

The manager or supervisor or whoever that told me to leave must have been promoted recently because only someone riding on a power fantasy about ordering people around would care about a scooter."
Subway (3045 Robie St),2,"I've never left a negative review before now. Arrived for pickup and was told the oven isn't working, so my sub isn't toasted as requested. Thought that it was odd to only have one toaster. Was asked if I was here to pick up a roast beef sandwich. I said no, turns out she meant my B.M.T. Got back to the office and right away see things on my sub I didn't order. Asked for 9 grain wheat bread, got italian herb and cheese. Asked for cheddar, have swiss. Asked for more letture, spinach, tomatoes, didn't even get the normal amount of those. Asked for black pepper, instead got black olives, cucumber, and pickles. Edit: No napkins, either"
Subway (3045 Robie St),1,"Not impressed by the attitude of your employees, my wife asked for a little extra mayo and she dumped a gallon on to her 6‚Äù sandwich. Would have been understood as an honest mistake if it weren‚Äôt for her short fused demeanour accompanied by the nasty scowl on her face."
Subway (3045 Robie St),1,Over charged me for a turkey sub. I wanted a regular turkey sub and because their system was down they could only bring up a turkey bacon ranch. The sub came to $19.95 when the regular turkey sub I wanted charged roughly $11. They don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing and clearly the employees like to rip people off. The manager needs to re-teach these employees on prices and how to ring in the right price when the system goes down.
Subway (3045 Robie St),1,"I went in to get a steak  sub and when asked what sauce I said not sure maybe honey mustard she did not hesitate but put on Smokey honey mustard and I said that is not the right one she insisted it was, I said that is Smokey honey mustard I said I asked for honey mustard and said I could not eat it she said I had to pay anyway I said I doubt it. So she scraped off the mustard and I said put on mayo instead. During the order she turned her head and coughed  at least 4 times not covering her mouth. She was rude and smiles were a foreign thing for this woman. I told my friend before going to this location that I did not like this subway...I still feel the same."
Subway (3045 Robie St),5,"I go there on the weekend for breakfast, the staff is very friendly and efficient, the music is relaxing and the dining area gets so much natural light it feels like a solarium. What a treat, especially in the winter!"
Omelet Brunch & Munch,5,"Deliciousness! Came here with the family today on their grand opening and was very satisfied with everything.

The servers were very friendly, the place was cozy, the food was delicious, and the price was surprisingly affordable for the quality of food we got.

Waited less than 30 min which was very good considering the place was packed on their grand opening.

We will be returning again! üòã"
Omelet Brunch & Munch,5,A new spot we decided to check out. We were not disappointed. The food was great. The prices were right. Service was great. Definitely going back!
Omelet Brunch & Munch,5,"Great little gym right on Quinpool rd, Great customer service, very affordable prices. And good location. Most importantly, food was soo yummy and well presented..
Will back for sure"
Omelet Brunch & Munch,5,"Large servings were well prepared and tasted great. The coffee was the highlight as most restaurants have plain boring weak coffee, but not here! It was a bit stronger and had a wonderful flavour. The waitress was great, really on the ball. We will be back."
Omelet Brunch & Munch,1,"My partner and I were very excited to have breakfast here and were feeling good about the experience when our server came up. She was so friendly and made great conversation.

However, the food was not good. My eggs came out and while taking a bite, I noticed the whites were still uncooked. I subbed the hash browns for fruit that looked like it was starting to rot in some places and did not even appear to have been cleaned.

My partner ordered the Eggs Benedict with avocado and bacon but the avocado was hard and hardly edible and the bacon was greasy as were the sausages.

The pricing throughout the menu seems very affordable if you're looking for a quick bite. As for parking as it is on Quinpool Rd which is known to not have much parking availability but the side streets around the area are usually pretty good. There are two steeper steps to get into the restaurant so it is not accessible.

Weighing out the pros (good customer service and cheap prices) from the cons (not great food, not accessible, parking) I do not think we will return."
Kempster's Cookhouse & Eatery,5,"Went on a Saturday morning around 8:30am with our two year old. We were seated right away and coffees brought over. Husband had the big breakfast with multigrain toast and I had the BBQ brisket eggs benedict. Everything was delicious, coffee was kept topped up. Our toddler had the side order of pancakes and some of our food. Loved the hashbrowns and the two pancakes were large and filling. A great breakfast!"
Kempster's Cookhouse & Eatery,3,Had the corn beef n cabbage.   The core was left in the cabbage.  The potato was dry.  No broth on the meal.  We won't get this again.  The service was great.  Had the Bread Pudding for dessert...excellent.
Kempster's Cookhouse & Eatery,5,I had fish with Ceasar salad and hubby had hot hamburger sandwich with fries and toffee pudding cake and coconut cream pie for dessert. It was absolutely delicious! First time there but won't be our last. Our waitress Elizabeth was so nice and friendly. Great experience all around. Keep up the great work!
Kempster's Cookhouse & Eatery,1,"This is what Kempsters call a fillet of Haddock. Both of the 2 piece fish and chips were less than 4"".  I've seen bigger goldfish in a petshop."
Kempster's Cookhouse & Eatery,5,"Ordered this place for breakfast today before work, and I the toast I got with my order was probably the best I‚Äôve ever had, idk why it was soo good but I will be coming back for more."
Tim Horton's (7010 Mumford Road Building B4),1,"I am writing this review to express my deep disappointment with the consistently poor customer service I have experienced at this Tim Horton location. As a frequent visitor, it saddens me to note that my recent visit only reaffirmed my concerns about the lack of dedication amongst the staff members and the overall quality of service provided.

First and foremost, the waiting time at this establishment continues to be excessively long, despite the queue not being particularly extensive. On this occasion, I was made to wait for nearly 10 minutes, mirroring previous experiences. It is disheartening to see that despite having more than seven staff members working at the front, the efficiency of service remains subpar.

One of the main issues I encountered was the apparent lack of understanding displayed by the employee taking orders. It was evident that she struggled to comprehend the items being ordered, leading me to assume that she was new in her position. However, when I inquired about her experience, she confirmed that she was not new, which further solidified my concerns regarding the dedication of the staff. Clear communication and knowledge of the menu are fundamental aspects of providing satisfactory customer service, and it was disconcerting to witness this lacking amongst the team.

Moreover, the overall demeanor of the staff members was far from welcoming. None of them had a cheerful or friendly disposition, which is an essential characteristic in the field of customer service. A warm and positive atmosphere plays a crucial role in ensuring a pleasant customer experience, and unfortunately, this was absent during my visit.

It is with a heavy heart that I feel compelled to write this review, as I genuinely hope that it will serve as constructive feedback for the management team of this Tim Horton store. I believe there is a pressing need for action to address these recurring issues and develop effective solutions to improve the level of customer service at this establishment.

In conclusion, I kindly request that the management team thoroughly evaluates the performance of the employees, focusing on their dedication, training, and understanding of customer needs. Additionally, consider implementing measures to foster a positive and welcoming environment for customers, as it can significantly enhance their overall experience.

I trust that the management team will take the necessary steps to rectify these concerns promptly. Tim Hortons has a reputation for excellence, and it is my sincere hope that the management will restore the high standards that have come to be expected from the brand."
Tim Horton's (7010 Mumford Road Building B4),3,"To be honest, this is one of the worse Tim Hortons in Halifax, it is small and gets busy, hard to find a seat. Because it is so swamped, staff is usually under lot of pressure and stressed. There are better Tim Hortons around city, the only good thing of this one is being close to Walmart and Dollarama."
Tim Horton's (7010 Mumford Road Building B4),3,"If possible could you please make sure your staff speak and understand english , if it was not for one of your older workers ,we would have had a hell of a time placing our order . Even with help we ended up going back to get the rest of our order ,which was placed in a different area ."
Tim Horton's (7010 Mumford Road Building B4),1,"They are closing before time. It showed 10 pm on google but I was here at 9 and they said they are closing early. When asked for a reason, they just cut the call. This is worst customer service! Just unacceptable. I would like to report the branch manager for this action and the employees. They cut the call on our face!!!"
Tim Horton's (7010 Mumford Road Building B4),1,"Just saw other comments about rude staff and now I am not amazed at all as Most of the stuff on menu they dont have and close all the machines early and if I said in drive thru, the guy who was taking order  ran to drive thru window to abuse me with his face fully outside ,was so unreal behaviour and worst customer service"
Bedford Basin Farmers Market,5,"I loved this spot! In winter and summer, it is worth the visit. They also have different menus every year and for every season, which is interesting. They offer a big variety of drinks and lots of non alcoholic, which is great! They also have delicious meals and their dessert options might not be a lot but the portion sure is! I tried the globe dinning with a group and it‚Äôs super fun! I highly recommend it. Also, they have the best Mexican corn I‚Äôve ever tried in the summer.. I hope they keep it every year!! Their salads are delicious and so are the fish tacos. Although, the pizza wouldn‚Äôt be something we would get again.. not the place for it. Overall, great spot, great experience, I‚Äôd definitely go again, soon!"
Bedford Basin Farmers Market,5,"A lovely restaurant right on the Bedford Basin where you can pull up in your boat and tie up to go to the restaurant. Of course it is also accessible from the Bedford Highway, but it is this water access that makes this place so nice. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the food was delicious."
Bedford Basin Farmers Market,5,"I recently had the pleasure of visiting Birch and Anchor, a hidden gem tucked away in the heart of Halifax. From the moment I stepped onto the patio, I was enchanted by the vibrant and festive atmosphere that awaited me.

The ambiance is truly one-of-a-kind. The patio is beautifully decorated with strings of twinkling lights that create a magical

What truly sets Birch and Anchor apart is the staff's genuine warmth and attentiveness. From the moment I arrived, I felt welcomed and well taken care of. The servers were friendly, attentive, and passionate about providing an exceptional dining experience. Their dedication to ensuring guest satisfaction was evident in every interaction, making the visit all the more memorable.

Whether you're seeking a romantic date night, a celebration with friends, or a place to unwind after a long day, Birch and Anchor is the place to be. The festive environment, coupled with the delightful patio and amazing food, creates a remarkable dining experience that lingers in your memory long after you leave. Thankyou"
Bedford Basin Farmers Market,5,"Love this spot! Was there for a perfect wedding last year and have been back many times since. Great food, beer and service with a top tier view! A great place to have a beer outside! My own Shakshuka is better with theirs is pretty good too ;)"
Bedford Basin Farmers Market,4,"Met some friends here for dinner.  It was our first time - place was very clean and servers were super friendly and patient.  We ordered some apples and then dinner.  Apices were a bit expensive for the amount received.

The food was hot and fresh - steak was very good and cooked the way it was ordered.  French fries were ok.  Beef brisket was tasty as well as the burgers.

Variety of beer and the ones we tried were very good.  Lots of space inside and lots more outside.  Love the boat dock for ‚Äúboat ins‚Äù and the fact that it is all outside in the summer time."
Julienne's Restaurant and Catering,3,"Good spicy noodle dish,   The downside was the staff didnt even offer a  glass of water. Dirty tables were evident and by the looks if it they had  more important things to do on there phones

Adding in a little customer focus and this place would be great"
Julienne's Restaurant and Catering,4,"Food was delicious. Ordered rice and noodle dish, and although their noodle seem to be more popular, I still prefer their rice bowl. Their noodle soup was a bit blend compared to the rice bowl but it was still 9.5/10.

Dropped one star because it doesn‚Äôt feel like eating in a restaurant. More like a food court instead.

All in all, one of those chinese hidden gem in the city worth to check out!"
Julienne's Restaurant and Catering,5,"Okay yum! One of the best Greek salads I ever received. Definitely made with love and hearty fresh veggies, my roast beef sandwich is exactly what I wanted too‚Äî fresh bread, nothing too crazy of ingredients and fresh meat. I will be back for sure and will indeed be spreading the word!"
Julienne's Restaurant and Catering,4,I really like their veggie stir fry which is a pretty good deal. They have all sorts of Asian snacks for sale too. The entrance is inside the professional center.
Julienne's Restaurant and Catering,5,"Went here couple times and always been one of my favourite places. Great noodles, great breakfast, great service."
A&W (68 Hogan Court),5,The All-Canadian Special breakfast was an excellent diner-ish experience for not-too-much money. I'll definitely be back.
A&W (68 Hogan Court),5,We find A&W one of the better fast food places to eat at. Food is almost always hot and tastes great. This location was very clean and nicely laid out with great customer service. My only gripe is the weird faucet/hand dryer in the bathroom. It isn't high enough to decently fit my hands under it.
A&W (68 Hogan Court),5,"Omg I never realized how amazing A&W breakfast is. By far, the best fast food breakfast around, you can get a real plated breakfast with toast, bacon, sausage,Hashbrown, and eggs anyway you want. Best breakfast bang for your buck."
A&W (68 Hogan Court),4,Food is good with friendly service and an atmosphere you would expect from a fast food restaurant.  Only thing is the hand dryer in the restroom is horrible.  It is in the sink and I understand the idea but when it turns on it shoots the air towards you and the water from your hand spray on you.  This has to go.
A&W (68 Hogan Court),5,"By far the best A&W in the city, amazing staff, beautiful restaurant and even better food. If you haven't been here yet, you're missing out!!!"
P√ºr & Simple (Halifax),5,"Went for brunch when we arrived in Halifax to see our daughter and brought her and her roommate out for some brunch.
We had joined the wait list online and were able to get a table as promised by the site A+ now if you‚Äôve been to any of these resto they are locally owned but by a chain. It was jammed busy but definitely very busy and noisy. Our poor server seemed overwhelmed with the amount of orders but she did her best.
We had your typical breakfast and enjoyed the food. If you want real maple syrup it‚Äôs an extra charge. So I‚Äôm not sure what is bottled on the table but definitely odd that you don‚Äôt get a lot for the extra charge for three fair size pancakes.
I had a skillet and with one egg which was plenty. Overall a decent breakfast."
P√ºr & Simple (Halifax),5,"We came the first time for brunch with 9 people.
It was really a cozy place, the menu is very diverse with many dishes. Although it was very busy, the service was really good and professional. The meal was better than what I expected and we did not have wait long time.
Good experience and highly recommend."
P√ºr & Simple (Halifax),5,"It's a big deal to me that I find celiac-safe food. I'm always anxious to try new places but I was not disappointed today! Service was above and beyond, they were more than willing to make any changes, and the food was very fast! I will be back"
P√ºr & Simple (Halifax),5,"Amazing brunch/breakfast! We try very hard to *not* go every weekend, but there‚Äôs only so much willpower to resist! Really great customer service here, the wait list system is awesome (always check ahead to see wait times on sat/sun, it gets busy!) Favourites on the menu include the eggs bennys, skillets, and waffles! The other locations around HRM are great too but the North End one is my favourite!"
P√ºr & Simple (Halifax),5,"We had a good time there today. Good service, good atmosphere, and good food! The place was very bright and cozy, and the food was super tasty! We got skillets üç≥ , egg Benedict, and wrap. The garden fresh skillet I got was very good! The taste was very rich, but I wish they could add one more egg and give less potatoes. The potatoes on the bottom were a little bit greasy, other than that it was so good!
My friends were really satisfied with the food! Seems like their egg Benedict was very very good."
Cousin's Restaurant,1,"It was a shame how far gone this restaurant has become after covid. The food was not good at all, and this place used to serve the best homemade meals in the North End a few years ago. They served us a green mouldy roll with the soup. Butter tasted like it expired last year. Sandwiches were burnt to black. Fish and chips were mainly oily batter and little fish meat.
The server had extremely noticeable body odour. They did not bother refilling the water or checking in. Rats were running inside between tables. The whole family meal was just a very unpleasant experience."
Cousin's Restaurant,5,"I've been going to cousins ever since I was a toddler almost 40 years ans their food is just as tasty as it was then. They also have Greek dishes as they are a Greek family owned establishment! They have the best baklava EVER! OH and coconut cream pie. üòã yummy. Some of the must haves are hot hamburger platter, hot chicken sandwich, any of their burgers, kabob meat with veggies in pita pork and chicken- both are to die for. As well as their fries ans gravy, real mashed potatoes and the pork chop dinner. Omg I almost forgot the seafood platter is where it's at. Also the BLT w/cheese or the one with BLT, cheese, hamburger, and turkey! Their service is always friendly unless you get one of the hags that have worked there for years! Will vacuum around you while eating! The owners are incredibly nice as I have known then for years üòÄdefinitely would recommend üëå"
Cousin's Restaurant,1,"Me and my friends went for breakfast for the first time in a long time. The sausages tasted like sawdust, the fish cakes tasted like they had been in the fridge for a very long time. The prices have gone up and the quality of the food and service has really gone down. Will not eat there again......"
Cousin's Restaurant,1,Ordered southern. Fried chicken.  I would even call it eddible so tasteless and dry... Fries were not even cooked. Veggies served not fresh.. Felt like the food was left over and reheated in microwave.
Cousin's Restaurant,1,"I went here my with mother and father the other day for lunch. My mother hadn't been here in several years but told me she used to go all the time with her best friend for lunch and had fond memories of the diner. My mom and I split the club sandwich and fries. The fries came out of the kitchen pretty much raw. We had to send them back. The club was so bland and dry. The service was terrible. The servers literally threw our dishes on the table.  At one point in serving my coffee, the server spilled the coffee all over the saucer and did not even acknowledge the mess. Will not be going back."
Cabin Coffee,4,"Warm and cozy coffee shop in downtown Halifax! The decoration is amazing, I can imagine it would be even more dreamy during Xmas time.
The coffee tastes very fresh and delicious. The pastry ootions are a bit limited. The peanut butter cookie was so delicious though!"
Cabin Coffee,5,"Cozy little place! Great place to stop in for a coffee to go or to stay and sit! Many people working or studying in the comfy space. We got the sweet potato soup with a  toasted roll, blue berry cranberry muffins & ice coffee and a milkshake. All was absolutely delicious & fresh!"
Cabin Coffee,5,"Wonderful cozy atmosphere that feels like you‚Äôre actually sitting in a cabin. That friendly East Coast charm, makes you feel like a local. The breakfast bun with bacon was delicious. Plain & simple good! Plenty of options: bagels, freshly baked scones & gluten free options too. Highly recommend a stop in, you‚Äôll love it!"
Cabin Coffee,5,"Get your butt down here to The Cabin

A nice big comfortable place with big leather chairs or small wooden tables, there is a constant flow in takeaways and fewer sit and relax folks.  The  brewed coffee gets a 7/10, the lattes a 10/10 , and the melt in your mouth cinnamon buns a serious 11/10, all with a relax factor of 12/10.
Prices are in the Justinflation stratosphere, but we still have to escape occasionally, even when it's our $ yet again - think $6000/nite hotel room to satisfy a narcissistic ego that would kill you if you jumped down to his ego. Let's hope wonderful little places like this don't go down the drain and take the important yet modest jobs with it.
Definitely would return!"
Cabin Coffee,5,"This place is so cute! The decor inside is so cottage like. We got a large iced lavender London fog and a double mocha and 4 cinnamon. It came to roughly $25. So you are paying more than you would at tim Hortons but it was worth it!!! Not only is the inside cute and the staff friendly but our drinks and cinnamon buns were amazing. The bag of cinnamon buns was HEFTY, and LOADED with cinnamon. Loved every bite. So rich I had to split it up to eat at different times."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (277 Lacewood Drive),5,"Vegetarian review:

There are a lot of vegetarian options, they even offer to replace meat with black bean in almost all dishes.

We ordered fruit crepe and blueberry pancakes which were delicious and refreshing. Custard was the Rockstar in crepes.
Smoothie had pretty amazing taste and was healthy as well ( kale mango)
Totally recommend for breakfast and brunches."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (277 Lacewood Drive),4,"It's what you expect from Cora, plenty of choices with breakfast items, not very busy for Saturday brunch time. Food comes put timely and hot, waiter was very attentive and polite. I just wish their potatoes are crisper."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (277 Lacewood Drive),2,"Had the breakfast poutine, and they subbed the breakfast sausage for hotdogs. Disgusting.

Service was good, but common, hot dogs?! ü§Æ

Taxes in for two was $54. Not worth it."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (277 Lacewood Drive),5,"5 stars because the service was outstanding. Very busy Saturday morning rush, but our server was very cheery and upbeat. She checked on us lots of times and had the coffee refilled before I could even ask."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (277 Lacewood Drive),1,I paid $55 for this portion and it‚Äôs missing the bacon strips on the ham I am not happy at all
The Nook,3,"I am working in a delivery. Never tried their food and beverages, but I guess they are pretty good. But please pack your coffee better, because It spills every time I take it. You should rethink the way you pack it to make me and customer happy and satisfied with that experience."
The Nook,5,"Just on my way to an appointment this morning and was looking for a place to have breakfast. This place was recommended to me. And I'm delighted that I came here. The service is great who is excellent people are friendly and I highly recommend this place for the Wake me up wrap, it's delicious!"
The Nook,4,"It's alright. It would be great to have more breakfast options but in all honesty it is not specifically a breakfast place. The coffee is good, they also serve beer, the ambiance is nice and the prices are quite reasonable. Located inside the Theater Lofts."
The Nook,5,"I come here super often as I live nearby and like to have a place to take my laptop and do some work for about 20 mins. This place has a decent latte with a large variety of flavoured syrups and some good baked sweets. All their baked treats are vegan which isn't something I care about but they taste great.

Their interior design is nice, but their benches are a tad uncomfortable. Good for a short stay as intended though.

Overall, it's one of my favourite places in the area to go and everyone working there has seen me probably a hundred times!"
The Nook,5,"Love love love this little spot. Excellent menu and wide selection of food that suits all dietary requirements/preferences. Coffee was fabulous as well. I like that I can get all kinds of drinks including alcohol.

My favourite part is of course that the nook supports their community directly; that is so important."
Healthyway Cafe,2,"We placed a work order in for our meeting just down the street. This wouldn‚Äôt be our first time ordering from this spot. First few times no problem. This time, I got a Thai chicken wrap and it tasted great until I looked down and saw a inch worm coming out of it. I was completely turned off and so was the rest of the work team. A lot of us ended up not eating this day. I tried to phone several times and no answer. I left a voicemail and no word back.
I get these things can happen but I just want others to be aware of this situation."
Healthyway Cafe,1,"The food is good however the cleanliness is questionable.  I have witnessed the serving staff use the same gloves while handling multiple peoples food. Also seen the same person start making someone's food, step aside to ring someone through the cash while STILL wearing the gloves and then proceed to finish making the food with the same dirty gloves they just rang someone in with. The grill they use also does not appear to be very clean, always have other folks previous orders grilled/ caked on to my wrap or bagel."
Healthyway Cafe,5,"Friendly and fast! Food is fresh, well prepared and tastes great! I enjoy stopping in here whenever I get a chance."
Healthyway Cafe,4,"Pretty standard fare, but conveniently located for me! Their wrap choices are awesome and their salads can be customized. Drop in sometime (it‚Äôs a hidden gem at the Mumford Professional Centre)."
Healthyway Cafe,1,"Unfriendly owner and the meat quality is terrible, it‚Äôs like that spongy Subway processed stuff. Many better places in the HRM to eat."
The Cake Factory (Spring Garden),5,"It was my first time, very good food and really good service. Nice to eat alone or with friends."
The Cake Factory (Spring Garden),4,Lovely experience from service to food. I was a bit skeptical as to being rushed due to the hours of operation but i needed not to worry. Every item ordered was superb! Compliments to the chef; i perhaps missed my server's name but she was great. My only reason for taking a star was due to the noise level because of how small the space is within the restaurant.
The Cake Factory (Spring Garden),5,"Everything was delicious! We really struggled with what to order because it all seemed great, so our waitress gave recommendations and we trusted her‚Äîand are so glad we did! Aside from the tasty food, everyone there was so kind and it‚Äôs super cute inside. Highly recommend!"
The Cake Factory (Spring Garden),5,Great food and ever better service. We also love the gelato.  It's on the pricier side but we felt it's worth it.
The Cake Factory (Spring Garden),5,"Had an amazing meal here. The staff was friendly and attentive. Started off with the mussels and had the featured fish of the day - seared halibut and scallop on a shrimp risotto. The fish was perfectly cooked, the skin was crispy but the meat was still nice and juicy. Finished off with the chocolate espresso torte. Everything was delicious but the fish definitely was my favourite. One of the best resturants I've tried in Halifax. Would definitely come again!"
Bluenose II Restaurant,4,We enjoyed going to this restaurant on a recent holiday in Halifax. I had scallops which were good - not that big though - we also ordered the salmon and the calamari- the calamari was great - the salmon was a little overcooked but tasty. We each had a drink from the bar which we found to be very reasonably priced. The atmosphere was casual and the service was friendly. I would go back :)
Bluenose II Restaurant,5,"Wow, i fell in love with this place.
I ordered the lobster dinner, and it was super delicious! It cam with clam chowder which was rich and creamy! It also came with a side and i choose mash potato which was amazing! The other side dish we ordered calamari was also delicious. The dessert was also very filling! Delicious as well.
I will definitely come back to Bluenose II when/if I ever travel back to Halifax!"
Bluenose II Restaurant,5,"So happy we went here during my recent vacation to Halifax. We had the seafood chowder and the 2 piece fish and chips. The food was excellent and served hot and fast. Very friendly staff, great atmosphere! We will definitely return."
Bluenose II Restaurant,5,"I recently visited Bluenose II in Halifax with my wife for a delightful lunchtime experience. This charming restaurant exceeded our expectations with its delectable seafood, cozy ambiance, and attentive service.

First and foremost, the food at Bluenose II is a true delight for seafood lovers. We indulged in an array of mouthwatering dishes, from succulent lobster rolls to perfectly seared scallops. Each bite was bursting with freshness and flavors of the sea, making for an exceptional dining experience.

The restaurant's interior exudes a comfortable and inviting atmosphere. The maritime-themed decor and beautiful seafaring artwork created a unique and enchanting ambiance. We particularly enjoyed sitting by the window, which offered a pleasant view of the bustling street outside. It was the perfect spot to unwind and soak in the relaxed vibes.

The service at Bluenose II was commendable. The staff members were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. They were prompt in taking our orders and made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal. Their warm and accommodating nature added to the overall positive experience.

In conclusion, our visit to Bluenose II was a delightful journey into maritime cuisine. The delectable seafood, comfortable surroundings, and attentive service made for a memorable dining experience. Whether you're a seafood enthusiast or simply seeking a relaxed and enjoyable meal, Bluenose II in Halifax is a fantastic choice."
Bluenose II Restaurant,4,"The food was good. Very quick, tasty, and fairly priced.
Service was meeting the bare minimum. The service was quick but the server never topped up our waters or even chatted with us. It was definitely efficient, but it felt like a get in and get out kind of dining experience. Then to have the lowest pre-set option for tipping to be 18% was shocking considering all that.
The restaurant was almost full when I went, so it was loud and difficult to have a conversation. I felt rushed to eat and leave since it was so busy."
Fairview Variety Quik-Way,1,"Literally the worst Chinese food in hrm. Garlic ribs were like leather, rice was over cooked, chicken balls I've had better from Costco. Will never order there again. If you want good Chinese silver dragon. Day and night difference."
Fairview Variety Quik-Way,5,"Sep 13th, 2016
I'm giving them ONE OF THE BEST CHINESE CUISINE restaurants in HRM. Very huge quantities n always consistent taste

Sep 24th, 2016
The pad thai is definitely the best in this Chinese restaurant lolüòú. Ordered schezwan chicken n had to try hard to find chicken. There is too many vegetables in it even broccoli. Yet tastes good n not bad - the quantity n quality is always good.

Good quality food. And like they say good quantity as well. If they can improve their customer service a little bit I will give it full five stars. But who cares if it's take out. U will get what u pay for. Don't ask for super spicy they end up adding too many dry red chillies n other stuff which might compromise the actual taste. Just go for hot if u like. Overall it's definitely a good place

Nov 23rd

Dine in restaurant experience I will give **/***** stars."
Fairview Variety Quik-Way,1,"We ordered last night, and it was a huge disappointment. The Shrimp Fried Rice had literally 7 cocktail shrimp and just rice; nothing else; I added my own garnish of green onions, the Cantonese fried rice had no chicken or pork or beef, but had spam cut in cubes (gross), a few cocktail shrimp and a frozen bag of mixed veggies used. Green beans and corn?? Assumedly if the ""vegetable egg rolls"" don't contain meat, the ""meat egg rolls"" would contain the same, but pork, right? Wrong! It was some gross mix of minced meat. The won ton soup was medicore too, and tasted like dirty dish water. For the prices this restaurant charges, it was not even remotely worth it, and I definitely wont be ordering here again. $14 for a cup of rice, spam and 25 cents worth of frozen veggies? Please. Find your Chinese food elsewhere."
Fairview Variety Quik-Way,5,"Ordered from here on a whim, loved it all and will be ordering from here again on the next Chinese food craving.
Ordered lemon chicken, s&s chicken balls, vegetable lo mein plain noodles, and egg rolls."
Fairview Variety Quik-Way,5,My favorite Chinese food in the Halifax area. Been a customer for 7 years and never disappointed. I moved out of the area 2 years ago and still make the drive in for the food!
Greco Pizza (Hammonds Plains),1,"This place has gotten my order wrong every time, most of the time the food is WAY undercooked. Today I placed an order because they are the only ones with garlic parm garlic fingers and again they messed up saying my order wouldn‚Äôt then be ready until 5:15‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs an hour or more after waiting half hour the first time.

Save your time and never go to this pizza place"
Greco Pizza (Hammonds Plains),4,"My go to pizza store.
I really like the feeling of walking into a small restaurant to get some pizza.
The stuffed crust is really nice ."
Greco Pizza (Hammonds Plains),5,Ive ordered pickup/delivery maybe 15 times. Always great service. Tonight they forgot donair sauce and had it delivered quickly. Love this place and their staff
Greco Pizza (Hammonds Plains),2,"Should have crossed the road to jessy's pizza.. .not impressed for 6$slice...
I'll never eat here again"
Greco Pizza (Hammonds Plains),4,Always good pizza.  Friendly service
Makhani Indian Restaurant,4,"The Ambience is ok, the food was really good. I ordered paneer methi makni it was flavorful and served piping hot üî•. The breads are good. Had Tandoori prawns it was mind-blowing, buttery, and tasty, but got only 8 pieces, portion could've been a little more. Overall good place to eat."
Makhani Indian Restaurant,5,"5 stars for 3 dishes.

1. Bombay paneer curry
2. Garlic naan
3. Dal makhani

The restaurant is a bit pricey. But the food tastes amazing. My recommendation would be definitely change the self serving system and the water jug you have replace it with some steel jug or glass."
Makhani Indian Restaurant,5,"Uploading menus with my review for visibility. If I'm in the area and I want Indian food, this is where I go. All the food is great, I try something new every time."
Makhani Indian Restaurant,5,We had Amritsari stuffed kulcha and it was really taste like India. Quality and quantity both were good . Staff is very polite and friendly.
Makhani Indian Restaurant,1,"We ordered bhindi masala and that was tasting awful and looks like it was not fresh. Secondly, paneer masala has just 4-5 pieces of paneer and its gravy has bad taste. So overall, they are lacking in quality as well as quantity."
Cacao 70 (Halifax),5,"They no longer serve pistachio chocolate! But the service is still good, even though the server ignored me a couple times, but in their defense, they seemed busy."
Cacao 70 (Halifax),4,"I had an enjoyable experience! The only thing I would nitpick would be the lighting inside the restaurant. It gives the place a rather dark and gloomy vibe, especially during night time. They also have really friendly and attentive staff, which was a delight.

The food was delicious. I would recommend their dark/white waffles. I also tried both their milky chocolate milkshake and their dark chocolate milkshake and they honestly tasted very similar haha. I expected the dark one to be slightly more bitter. Nothing particularly bad or anything but, something I found interesting. They also have a lava cake on the menu minus the lava. It seemed more like brownies to me to be honest. But it was still really tasty!

Overall, I would still recommend this to anyone!"
Cacao 70 (Halifax),5,"Very kind young people running this place! We got the milk chocolate fondue and it was great. The chocolate was delicious, the waffles were toasty, brownies were chewy and dense, and the fruit was fresh. Fondue chocolate was quite sweet - would consider mixing the dark and the milk chocolate next time. We also ordered the mocha and it was good."
Cacao 70 (Halifax),3,"We did takeout. But it was ok ok experience. We were waiting for our order for 40 minutes and I Said to my friend let‚Äôs just pay . The lady had no clue what we ordered and they were the ones who said pay later , when your order will ready. Not a problem we ordered 40 minutes late again. Than they took long to prepare and also sat on the table , it was clear that waffles will get cold .Well, they did get cold , and when we arrived home after all that wait and struggle. There was only one scoop of ice cream and other two were whip-cream . I paid $20 , it wasn‚Äôt worth my money ."
Cacao 70 (Halifax),3,"This place was a little hard to find on the habourfront. It was empty when we went in, although we still waited a long time for 2 milkshakes to be made. The shakes themselves were absolutely heavenly, wow. There's some language barrier issues with the kids working the shop, and we didn't feel like staying as the interior wasn't all that inviting. We walked a few feet to the end of the pier and enjoyed our shakes there. Every sip of that mocha shake was better than the last."
BarBurrito: Nova Scotia: Cole Harbour,3,"The food is good at this location however there are frequent mistakes or missing items.

Missing chips from combos, missing ingredients from tacos or the wrong ingredients in tacos.

While it is frusterating not getting exactly what you ordered, the quality of the ingredients are high.

I am guessing that because this location opened so recently that there are still some training issues with new staff.

I look forward to hopefully making this review more positive once the staff has had a chance to better mature into their rolls."
BarBurrito: Nova Scotia: Cole Harbour,5,"Are you tired of burgers, pizza and chicken? Give this place a try. There is an excellent selection of flavours to choose from and your meal is prepared fresh before your eyes. Staff is friendly and this is the cleanest restaurant I have been in for some time. Even the bathrooms were shiny! Highly recommend this location."
BarBurrito: Nova Scotia: Cole Harbour,5,Food is very very good.  Service is friendly and there are some tables if you want to eat there. It is a healthy option to fast food.
BarBurrito: Nova Scotia: Cole Harbour,5,"I was a regular customer at a different burrito place, but they were closed one day so I tried barBURRITO. Great food! I enjoyed it a lot and will be coming back on a regular basis."
BarBurrito: Nova Scotia: Cole Harbour,5,I drive the extra distance to this location because they actually fill the bowls and the staff are super friendly :)
FIVE GUYS ARGYLE (NS-1915),5,"I've never tried five guys in the U.S.A but my first time trying it here was absolutely amazing. The burger was fresh and delicious, made to order, and the fries are unlike anything you've ever had as they use peanut oil. Highly recommend"
FIVE GUYS ARGYLE (NS-1915),5,"Classic Five Guys. Took my girlfriend here for her first time ever trying their burgers, and she agreed they lived up to the hype I had built for them. Spacious location, seemed well maintained and clean from my visit there. Amazing milkshakes and fries, the Cajun fries are delicious.

If you‚Äôre looking for a high quality burger and willing to pay a little extra for it, Five Guys is one of the most consistent places you can go. Great job to the workers and management of this location."
FIVE GUYS ARGYLE (NS-1915),5,"Just popped in on a Friday night while visiting the area.  All I can say is WOWZERS best burger I have EVER had.  Atmosphere was great, clean, and busy.  Love the shelled peanuts ü•ú too."
FIVE GUYS ARGYLE (NS-1915),3,"I liked the space because it‚Äôs renovated and spacious. First visit here in Halifax after eating at Five Guys in Toronto and Five Guys in NYC. Well, I ordered a hot dog with a bunch of toppings on it. Some hours later I felt very sick of my stomach. Thank God I was already home. I will never order a hot dog there again and I have no idea if the cause of my sickness were one of the toppings."
FIVE GUYS ARGYLE (NS-1915),3,"First visit. Decided to get the coworkers together and try this joint. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger. Apparently there are a ton of toppings and such. Have a good read of the sign above when ordering.

They my order to go instead of dine in but oh well I guess. The foil wrapped burger looked like it had seen better days but don‚Äôt let that fool you. It‚Äôs not frozen and turned out to be two Patties. For a standard fare burger this tasted great (Not frozen) and local fries were over salted. They were good though.

Be aware the regular fry portion is huge. You may not want to order something larger. I was warned about this.

The price point was on the high side considering it was not gourmet but I enjoyed it none the less.

The atmosphere seemed to transport me back to the old burger joint days.

I was not impressed with the toilets stalls.  The only way out was to hug yourself between the side of the toilet and the wall. Kinda silly cause you can‚Äôt open the door due to the fact the door is so tight to the front of the toilet."
Pizza Pizza (1565 Argyle St.),5,Amazing pizza. Totally worth the price. My server/pizza makers name was Keshavi. She was very friendly and made a very good pizza. The store maintained excellent cleanliness.
Pizza Pizza (1565 Argyle St.),5,"The pizza was great! The extra cheese made my mouth water. The server, Kashevi, was also very welcoming. Excellent food and customer service all in all."
Pizza Pizza (1565 Argyle St.),5,"I visited the restaurant a few weeks ago and had the pleasure of being assisted by Keshavi. Though I walked in for just a slice well past midnight, she took the time to run through the offerings and we ended up ordering more than a few items from the menu. She was quick and prompt with our order even though she was by herself and there was a steady stream of customers walking in. Professionalism at its best. The pizza and the sides tasted great and since then I've ordered take out on multiple occasions and the service / taste has exceeded my expectations each time. Keep up the good job!"
Pizza Pizza (1565 Argyle St.),5,Amazing pizza... And best customer service... Very pleasant atmosphere...
Pizza Pizza (1565 Argyle St.),5,Very delicious pizza and amazing service by employee (Keshavi)
Red Chillies Flavours of India,5,We drove all the way from New Brunswick as were craving Kerala food at a restaurant and this place did not disappoint. I am not a big fan of South Kerala Biriyani but no complaints. The porotta was frozen one reheated so was not that special. Angamali mango fish curry and chicken 65 were mind-blowing and so was the Naan. Overall a good experience and will try some other options on the menu next time.
Red Chillies Flavours of India,4,"Vegetarian Review

We ordered Soya Chaap, Mysore Dosa and Thatha Dosa.
Soya chaap is a must try, authentic taste.
Mysore Dosa‚Äôs taste was perfect but it was not crispy at all.
Thatha dosa was okayish.
They added vada to each dosa plate which was yummy. Sambhar and chutneys were the best part.
It has a lot of vegetarian options. Their prices justify the taste. Must try indian cuisine resturant."
Red Chillies Flavours of India,5,I just tried Red Chillies in Bedford for the first time and I loved their taste.. I am very foodie and i love Soya Chaap. I have tried chaap in Halifax and I think Red Chillies did a good job as well. I personally liked their Hakka Noodles Veg. They use thin noodles and their taste was perfectly hakka.. indian style. Our server Henna was also very kind and polite. Her service was awesome. I will definitely come again and would definitely recommend to others as well.
Red Chillies Flavours of India,4,"It was great at first.. taste and portion are good.

Third visit was a disappointment, no spices are added in right amount.. daal makhni was severed tasteless may be a different chef"
Red Chillies Flavours of India,1,"Take out experience had never been great, unlike other Indian restaurants, they don't make it based on the order. Most of the dishes are already precooked or prepared to finish on a given day. So try telling them not to add something or customize a small thing, you won't get it. The only thing they can do is just spice level. Their service used to be good until when they started getting the desperate diners who are known to them, willing to give 5 stars for whatever they get. They stopped caring about the quality n service. If you are taking out, pls make sure everything is in order and the poor quality takeout boxes are leaking and the breads are burnt like what I got. No other Indian restaurant peers use this filthy Styrofoam containers. I am open to see if anything improves and review again soon."
Beyond Temptation,3,We ordered samosa chat it was just ok. Samosa  was good but the taste of chickpea was not of our taste. Service was quick and professional. Atmosphere was also amazing. Restaurant was clean.
Beyond Temptation,3,"I ordered food from Skip and the fries were extremely oily and not even hot. And the sandwich was also not hot, and taste overall was okay okay."
Beyond Temptation,4,"Beyond Temptation very pleasant surprise in terms of dine in when you are in Halifax.The food is very delicious, fresh, served hot, with an appetizing presentation.
The menu is very diverse, with a variety of dishes to choose from at very affordable rates. It‚Äôs the perfect place to enjoy tasty snacks and dosas and have a great time with your family and friends. Service is fast. It‚Äôs one of those places that keeps you coming back. I highly recommend!"
Beyond Temptation,4,"This place serves a variety of food items. We ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, Vada Pav and a Cheese burger.
The Sandwiches were ok but we enjoyed the Burger here. The Vada Pav was good too."
Beyond Temptation,5,"The best restaurant in halifax, I have been to üòç Don‚Äôt forget to try their mysore masala/any dosa and mastani shake ü§§ ‚Ä¶ I would recommend it to each and everyone to visit at least once if u are in Halifax, (trust me u don‚Äôt know what u are missing) üòÅ.."
Happy Sushi Restaurant,3,"Went for dinner on a Thursday night, plenty of tables available. No background music, quiet atmosphere. The prices of the all-you-can-eat were higher in person than they are on their website, so that was an unfortunate surprise for us.
Ordered a beer to start, only $5 for a Coors Light, not bad! Dinner was $27.99 plus 10% fee for one adult.
The service was good, however we got the wrong food items a few times in a row. (Ie ordered Red Dragon sushi roll but received Tuna sushi roll instead). The food itself tasted good and hit the spot.
The very last sushi roll we ordered tasted definitely off, almost like the avocado in it was bad or chemically, but that was a one off.
Overall ok experience."
Happy Sushi Restaurant,5,This is my favourite all you can eat sushi place in the Halifax area. The service is always fast and I've never had a problem getting a large group in. The fish is fresh as they told us they buy it almost every day. Love this place.
Happy Sushi Restaurant,5,"Overall great!

The decor is nice and modern. The tables have been well spaced.

Service was quick and courteous.

The menu options were huge, especially considering we just had the lunch options.

The food in general came out fast and was well made. Rolls were well proportioned and ingredients were good.

Price was exceptionally good!"
Happy Sushi Restaurant,3,"Overall really this restaurant falls in the middle. 3/5.
The good: place is super clean. Staff were friendly and service was (somewhat) acceptable. Its slower since the food is ""Fresh"".
What could be better: the food isn't as tasty as other places in HRM. Some of the appetizers felt like they were precooked and heated in a microwave. You could tell because the plate was hot.

For the price, there are better selections in HRM."
Happy Sushi Restaurant,2,The quality of food is not what I was expecting. The chicken was dry and the shrimp was quite small and lacked taste. I'm very upset because I just moved into the area and was hoping for a local gem. Luckily the city has many sushi locations so I won't have to go without.
Fong Sing Restaurant,5,"Had the steam buns, Vietnamese spring rolls and two types of pho! Delicious food, awesome atmosphere and great price üòä"
Fong Sing Restaurant,2,Good service but the food was not good. Rice not properly cooked and the meat almost cold.  Won't go back there again.
Fong Sing Restaurant,4,"Yum! Pho is tasty, salad roll tastes good with the bbq pork inside and the dip tastes right, unlike some other pho place that just opened downtown. My daughter and I have started a new tradition to split a large bowl of beef pho, salad roll and Vietnamese spring roll after gymnastics. Nice lil mom and pop feeling restaurant. Nothing fancy, also bottles of wine are cheap.

Just got my food.. spring roll was cold :("
Fong Sing Restaurant,4,"Very good prices and the food is delicious.  The only problem that I had once time was when I tried to order less fried wonton than their normal order of 12. They told me it was not possible ,in my personal opinion,  it would be  better to sell 6 for the half price than nothing. But in general this place is very recommended."
Fong Sing Restaurant,1,"Service was good. Ordered chicken fried rice, it was not smelling burnt and there was not even a single piece of chicken im them. It was closing time and I guess they gave me leftover."
Efty Dishes Restaurant,5,"So we are here in Halifax for a couple of days and we usually come here for few days and go back. We originally from Cameroon but live in NB. We tried many restaurants, we always order on ub@r e@t. This time around we checked for another African restaurant and found Efty. We were skeptical because of our previous experience from another African restaurant but we ordered and spend like 100$ on food. My God the food is good üòÇand trust me I am a good cook and don't usually eat food elsewhere than home. We ordered egusi with pounded yam & some other foods. The only thing was the fried meat I think they forgot, I will have to call them back tomorrow. Great experience and thanks again for doing great food."
Efty Dishes Restaurant,2,"I‚Äôve had their jollof/fried rice, tastes good and sizable portions. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the fish stew, it was 60% oil, mostly pepper and the plantain was stale."
Efty Dishes Restaurant,5,"A taste of home‚Ä¶This was the best Nigerian restaurant experience I have had in 4 years,  the meal was delicious, and the standard was very impressive! And the guy that attended to us was very courteous and friendly too.."
Efty Dishes Restaurant,5,"I have tried almost all the dishes from this ' home away from home' restaurant. All the dishes are superbly delicious.  My favorite is the Pounded Yam and Bangalore soup with snail. You can't help but ask for more.
It's simply value for my money üí∞."
Efty Dishes Restaurant,5,"The food is tasty, awesome experience dining at the restaurant. The staff and the CEO are warm and friendly. The quality and quantity of the food is more than the cost. It's a great place to visit if you miss Nigeria."
ZenQ (Halifax),1,"DO NOT ORDER RAMEN !!!
As you can see in the picture this is spaghetti not ramen noodles. The entire dish is flavorless, I am beyond disappointed with this meal. As hungry as I was I only took a few bite before I threw it out."
ZenQ (Halifax),4,Large menu full of food and drinks. Fast service and a relatively big area for seating. Half of the joint is filled with their own stuff including a Christmas tree in August and the other half is seating. We ordered the milk tea frappe which is milk tea flavoured shaved ice with toppings. It is great for a nice summer day but we preferred the one at the Spring Garden branch because the flavour was more pronounced. No parking right in front but there are street parking nearby.
ZenQ (Halifax),4,"I‚Äôve ordered their food through the delivery app a couple times. Love their braised pork rice and Taiwanese crispy chicken, both tasted very Taiwanese and delicious. Their wonton w spicy sauce was fine, better add some soy sauce and vinegar lol cuz it tasted too plain.
I also got their Chinese style omelette wrap and bubble tea. I remember the first time I ordered the omelette wrap, which was super salty. I ordered it again this time and it tasted way better.
Bubble tea is always the best choice from this shop, they really do well in their beverages!"
ZenQ (Halifax),1,Got chicken wonton soup. The wonton wrap is huge and the filling inside is ridiculously tiny. I guess they could change their product name to noodle soup with pork pieces instead of wonton soup. Also have waited one and half hour for the food. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place at all.
ZenQ (Halifax),5,"I just went to ZenQ for the first time today and ordered an original boba taro.  Think is the best spot I have been to.  Generally I do not like the bubbles because they are so sweet everywhere else.  These were perfect and changed my outlook!  This drink wasn't overly sweet either!  Hands down favourite spot.  They were also friendly, clean inside and the food looks wonderful - I cannot wait to try it!!"
Boston Pizza (Downtown Halifax),1,The poutine was really dry and we ordered a side of gravy. After it and got charged for it the service I didn't think was too great as well as they never came and asked if the food was okay or not they never gave our dessert with the kids meal after we were done. No one asked. Wings I had better at other BP for everything. Pizza well you can't really mess up on that too bad but it wasn't a mind blower. For $113.68 do better BP maybe come back around in a year to see if you improved
Boston Pizza (Downtown Halifax),5,Came for a birthday celebration. Great food and awesome music. Service was good too. Can recommend for a nice relaxed evening.
Boston Pizza (Downtown Halifax),3,"Ordered a Caesar Salad with grilled chicken for delivery tonight off Ubereats. The chicken was good, generous portions of croutons, bacon and lettuce - but soo little dressing on the side. Unfortunately I didn't have any dressing at home so I didn't end up enjoying it that much. I would recommend at least twice the amount of dressing that they gave me. I was eating just raw lettuce."
Boston Pizza (Downtown Halifax),3,"Very busy, you would think last day of  school they would have extra servers.  The server was asked multiple times for items took 20 minutes to receive.  Kids finished chicken fingers before extra sauce was brought to the table.

A glass of pop is 3.99 ridiculous...refills free however, but never asked if wanted a refill even when glass was empty.
Pizza was good, Kids enjoyed chicken fingers which looked very good.   Lunch pizza good value at 13.00 which included a side."
Boston Pizza (Downtown Halifax),1,"I am upset with the professionalism of the manager of the restaurant on Granville Street.
I ordered with Skip the Dishes and I was missing an item worth $28. When I called to inform the staff I was told my only option was to come to the store to pick up my missing item or receive a credit. I wanted the item sent out to me. I asked to speak to the store manager
and when he came on the phone I was not treated fairly. He was interrupting me when I was trying to tell him what happened and how I would like it resolved. Then he proceeded to tell me to calm down when I truly was being calm and just trying to communicate to him what happened and how I would like it resolved. He actually began to laugh sarcastically at one point and now I was feeling angry but I still did not raise my voice nor did I become abusive. The Manger did agree to send me a store credit of $20 which I will give to someone else because I will never do business with this franchise again.

Update on this situation.
In fairness to Boston Pizza the store manger called me and apologized for his actions and he explained more clearly where he was coming from. He also credited me with the amount I paid for the food and gave me  a store credit as well. I respect that he did this and I am happy to say that I think he did a good job in fixing a bad situation. I am always willing to give people and businesses a second chance so I will not avoid Boston Pizza and I will not talk down about them. Looking forward to starting over with them."
May Garden (Dartmouth),4,"Honestly not bad.

The ordered a few dishes, egg rolls, hot and sour soup and a black bean beef dish.

The egg roll was good, well filled and reasonably priced. The roll was crispy but not hard.

The hot and sour soup was excellent. Had BBQ pork slices in it and lots of wood ear. It had a good tang!

The black bean beef stir fry. This was ok, the ratio of peppers and onion to beef was a bit much. The portion size was good but really could use more beef and less peppers. The black bean sauce was excellent though, salty good blackbean!

Service was top notch! They were quick and courteous, and exceptionally thoughtful. They brought us spare soup bowels to share and seperate plates for us to share the dishes.

Interior was very good, felt like an older chinese restaurant, but otherwise clean and well spaced. The fish tank at the centre of the restaurant was also a nice touch.

Parking, it's all street parking in the area but that is par for the course as it's downtown."
May Garden (Dartmouth),2,Very poor quality food. Had a special. The SS chicken balls had almost no chicken. The sauce had no flavour. Chicken fried rice was basically rice. Almost. I need in beef n broccoli.  Very disappointed.
May Garden (Dartmouth),1,"I went into the Portland street location to submit a resume today. after greeting,  the first question I asked was if they were currently hiring, and the Asian lady rudely dismissed me and told me to go away. I was shocked and asked if she‚Äôs the owner and she told me not to even bother.
I‚Äôm pretty sure if I was there to buy food, she wouldn‚Äôt talk to me that way ."
May Garden (Dartmouth),1,"AVOID

Myself and my partner are currently recovering from our bout of food poisoning we suffered as a result of eating the food we ordered from this restaurant. Food seemed okay, but within two hours of eating we began to feel ill. We ate on Friday and symptoms are just starting to subside today on Sunday. I am definitely avoiding this restaurant for the indefinite future, and would implore others to learn from my recent mistake and do the same."
May Garden (Dartmouth),1,"I‚Äôve been to this restaurant several times and had fairly good experiences, but got incredibly sick last weekend after eating here, and am still ill. After reading similar reviews I felt compelled to post. Obviously something is going wrong in the kitchen."
Efes Turkish Cuisine,5,Without a doubt the best Baklava I've ever had. It was amazing. The mains and started were good too. The servers were friendly and would seek answers to questions from the chef/manager. We wanted to go back just for Baklava the next night but they were closed by the time we got there. Will definitely visit again when in Halifax; even if only for the Baklava.
Efes Turkish Cuisine,5,"Shared the yogurt chicken, and a haloumi cheese wrap. The chicken was incredible, well charred on the outside, and sauce was delish!  Wrap wasnt my favourite but not what I ordered so it was never going to be my first choice :)

Got a patio seat on a rare sunny day, plus there was lots of parking available nearby"
Efes Turkish Cuisine,5,Unbelievably delicious and impeccable service. I popped in here for lunch with my 11 month old baby. The servers were so kind and helpful with her! They kept checking in and even carried my stroller down the stairs. The food was incredible too. I used to live in Germany and had a lot of Turkish friends who I would cook with. This was like having amazingly fresh home cooked Turkish food. Go here. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. I will definitely be back and will be bringing out of town guests here too!
Efes Turkish Cuisine,5,"Got a very tasty dinner tonight. Lamb shish kebab and feta salad with 2 sauces. Very beautiful interior inside of the restaurant, all the paintings and Christmas decorations. The food was amazing! Will be back!"
Efes Turkish Cuisine,5,"Favorite restaurant in Halifax. Solid experience every visit. Food consistent. Delicious! No fake on flavour. Service and environment always pleasing. I could go on...ok, I will... the meat is always juicy and sides, fresh. Salad fresh, rice clean unique and full flavour. Dinner for two is my go to whether I'm with 1 or 3 other people, add another appy, like lamb liver or grilled goat cheese... baklava authentic, as are the tea and coffee. Wonderful!"
McDonald's (675 Upper James Street),1,"Edit: 0/5. The last two visits, the screen displaying the order numbers has been off. The self-serve kiosks have not been printing receipts. I watched a lineup of over 25 people form because of this, while several mentioned to the staff that calling out numbers (as is usual) was not working because no one was aware of their order number, due to the previously mentioned technical issues. The employees continued to call only the order numbers despite being informed. Only one, who appeared to be the manager, understood that the full order must be read in order for us to know what was going on. When we got the food, the sauce and lettuce were outside the soggy bun, and it was cold.

Previous review (3/5). Busy location. The Carolina BBQ Quarter Pounder could be so much better. The Golden BBQ sauce is quite tasty and the crispy onions are nice. However, no one seems to know how to make one of these special burgers. You never get enough sauce or onions, and the burger ends up pretty dry compared to the original with lettuce and condiments. It's also always a mess when you get it."
McDonald's (675 Upper James Street),1,"We ordered McFlurries. They were a little busy, but we waited... and waited... and eventually found out - when we broke down and asked why it was taking so long - that they had just made them and left them on the counter to melt. So... we were given melted ice-cream and told ""sorry for the wait."" Sorry for the wait? Why did we wait - they served everyone who had ordered after us. I guess they just wanted to give our drinks time to warm up? New policy, maybe?"
McDonald's (675 Upper James Street),1,Seems like every single time I order food I'm pulled to a spot to wait. Today it was 14 min. I work in service I'm in a service vehicle. On my 15 min break I stop for a quick breakfast. I wait my entire break to receive my order. This will be my last time. The amount of competing companies I can stop at is endless. Good bye McDonald's
McDonald's (675 Upper James Street),1,"I waited 20 minutes for a lager fry. They were not short staffed, or face with anything that would slow down the order process. After 5 minutes of waiting I ask a employee if my order was in process. The worker told me off. And staff ignored me, customer with way lager order than me and order after me. Were getting there order first. They said later they were out of frys but were completely ing other people frys order. Who order after me."
McDonald's (675 Upper James Street),5,"After having an absolute horrible day, I went to Walmart and needed to get dinner. The staff there especially the manager and all the rest of the stuff. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm not good with names. You guys are top notch. Thank you so much for accommodating me. You guys made my night I appreciate it more than you know. Thank you. Ashley"
Wendy's (869 Upper James Street),1,"I ordered breakfast from this location because I wanted to give them another chance, and I really enjoy Wendy's when craving fast food. This is the second time I've ordered from this particular location and paid for extras I did not receive. It may not seem like a big deal, but to me it demonstrates a lack of attention and care that could be life threatening (if you you have allergies for example)! I'll be looking at other Wendy's franchise locations for future orders as it is extremely unlikely this one will get a third chance, and I certainly recommend looking elsewhere if you want a restaurant that will provide you the food you've paid them for!"
Wendy's (869 Upper James Street),4,"Delicious, fresh hamburgers made to order. Staff hardworking and courteous. Clean facilities. Great place to drop by for breakfast, lunch or dinner! Ordered regular cheeseburger #1 on the menu.

2nd visit- ordered Cobb salad and it was alright. Fresh ingredients. Staff was fast and efficient. It wasn't busy before noon hour."
Wendy's (869 Upper James Street),1,"DISGUSTING. Has the owner gone bankrupt?

This place was the best Wendy's in Hamilton 10 ish years ago. It is now absolutely filthy and disgusting. I felt since they did a renovation that the place would be nice. It was probably the worst fast food restaurant I've ever stepped foot in.  The bathrooms are locked and you have to be buzzed in from the front. The bathrooms are absolutely filthy, look like they haven't seen a broom or a cleaning agent in years, NO TOILET PAPER, walls covered in what looks like month old soap?

The floors in the restaurant look like they haven't seen a broom in years. Fruit flies throughout the dining room. Half the tables uncleaned. Seat cushions ripped or cut out on most of the booths.

The soda machine has about 5 percent of the drinks available, the rest aren't available.

To the franchisee. Take a walk around your business now and then. You'd be absolutely ashamed of what happened to this location.

To Wendy's Canada. Do a mystery shop of this location. You may force the franchisee to sell it.

This is no way aimed towards the few employees who were working.  They are understaffed but still polite. I feel bad for them.

I need a shower after visiting this location.  Yuck."
Wendy's (869 Upper James Street),1,"We usually make this a stop when we're on the mountain, until today when a small bug crawled out of the wrapper for my burger; I appreciate them offering to remake the burger and for trying to offer a refund but the whole thing put me off, I certainly wasn't going to try another burger and the JBC wasn't worth bothering to get a refund, honestly I just wanted to leave the restaurant as soon as we could. We love Wendy's so I'm sure I'll give the location another try down the road, unfortunately it's gonna be a while after this experience. Inspect your food at this location."
Wendy's (869 Upper James Street),5,"The food was hot and fresh which was a welcomed surprise as it was 12:30 AM and they were about to close @ 1:00 AM. The server was pleasant and greeted us with a smile. We had a spicy chicken combo and cheeseburger combo they were both very good. We will be back, thanks Wendy's!"
Tim Horton's (80 John St),1,"i ordered online thru doordash & my strawberry chill didn‚Äôt have the lid on properly so when i took it out, it spilled everywhere. they didn‚Äôt have food but instead of refusing my order and letting it go to another timmies they told me to refund it."
Tim Horton's (80 John St),5,"Traditional Canadian cafeteria, with lots of snack options and my favorite French Vanilla cappuccino. Staff are friendly and service is fast. Atmosphere is not so good because downtown is a busy area, but I use to go there anyway."
Tim Horton's (80 John St),5,My favourite location to go to. The evening staff always welcome me with a smile and usually start making my tea as soon as they see me. Very friendly staff. They always take the time to ask my how work is and how my child is. The afternoon supervisor (I never remember her name) has the kindest soul ‚ù§Ô∏è
Tim Horton's (80 John St),1,"If I could give 0 stars I would. This location is one of the grossest next to King and Caroline and Wellington. The staff here even gets why ppl start with wanting something, like an iced capp with whipped cream and then turn to a regular coffee when they see the wiped cream being replenished and put back into the nasty, unclean, crusty old whipped cream container. But they still wait for a complaint to do something about it. This is the closest location to me and I would rather go somewhere else. I'm terrified to try a donut from there, has the glaze bucket been cleaned this month? I will NoT allow my child to have milk from this location, as who knows if the order of rotation even applied here."
Tim Horton's (80 John St),1,"I live close by to this timmies and order online through their mobile app multiple times a week. The store is busy, high traffic from walk in orders, mobile pick up orders, doordash/skip drivers and now the option for people to dine in. It is a hit or miss if staff is on the ball, and quite often than not there is something wrong with my order.

I find the staff here have their regular customers by which they know by name and serve in a polite welcoming manner, then they rush and push everyone elses orders. Im attaching a picture of what my sandwich looked like today, the staff and manager at this location seemed to think there was nothing wrong but ive never seen an english muffin cut like that. I returned to the store and had my order refunded, people should take pride in their work even if it is just making a sandwich."
Burger King #2426 (210 Centennial Parkway North),4,Tried the new Ch'King chicken sandwich.    The chicken patty alone was 5.2oz making it the biggest chicken patty of all the fast food places.   It was thick and crunchy.   The taste was good but not as good as my favorite Mary Browns.    I would get it again.
Burger King #2426 (210 Centennial Parkway North),5,"Didn‚Äôt eat in, we went through the drive-thru, we place only a small order (1) vanilla ice cream cone and (1) Chocolate Fudge Sundae @$1.99 each.  On this evening the order taker was very pleasant and well mannered.  No attitude and handed us our order carefully and competent with beautiful manners (I told her so) nice to see this as other places you go to you can get attitude.  Didn‚Äôt get any food products, as we already ate elsewhere.  Just wanted to leave a positive comment in her direction, as Management so be aware of her diligence in her employment.  Have been to other Burger Kings and not so much good service on occasions.
Keep up the great work,
from appreciative seniors."
Burger King #2426 (210 Centennial Parkway North),3,"Whopper Wednesday has been a good time and good deal. It's plenty of food.

Staff here generally make me a fresh pot of coffee to have with my combo. That's a good touch that they know the previous brew was a little old.

Breakfast sandwich combos are good, it's nice that the cheese isn't a Kraft single."
Burger King #2426 (210 Centennial Parkway North),5,"Great service and always get my order right (I always have my whopper altered since I don't like ketchup or sauces on my burger, or tomatoes) even if it's busy 99% of the time have my order perfect. Upgrade my fries to poutine also. And if it's wrong/missing something or mixed up they fix it no problems! Consistently, going to that location for 9 years üëå"
Burger King #2426 (210 Centennial Parkway North),1,Had my wife buy me a bacon and egg croissant with a large hash brown for breakfast this morning. With the 2 minutes to drive to my work to give it to me. The hash browns were rock hard as if they overcooked them. It‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve had a bad experience with my food at this location. Was hoping the food quality would get better over the months but I was wrong. Won‚Äôt be returning there anymore for any food. They use to be good and the food quality use to be great but now it‚Äôs horrible.
7-Eleven (622 Upper Wellington St @ Brucedale),5,"This weekend we were able to visit Emoi Vietnamese restaurant in Hamilton. We had heard some good reviews and they did not disappoint! The fresh spring rolls and the fried spring rolls were very very good. The mango salad was fresh and a very large serving. A few of us had the noodle bowls. We tried the short rib, lemongrass and grilled pork bowls. They were delicious. The meat was very flavourful in each dish and very tender. Some of us also had the shaking beef plate. It was also very good. Also a very good sized portion. We all agreed we would return. We highly recommended checking it out. The decor inside was also beautiful and very clean and modern. Our waiter was also very friendly, attentive and quick to recommend several dishes. A valuable restaurant addition to Hamilton!"
7-Eleven (622 Upper Wellington St @ Brucedale),5,This restaurant most likely is the best thing that happened on upper Wellington. I have been to many Vietnamese restaurants I Hamilton area but this one I can classify to be the best hands down. It is located on a stretch which not busy but the quality of food is beyond superior. Few dishes that I haven‚Äôt seen anywhere. Amazing Vietnamese coffe. They have an item as P4 which is a rare beef with boiling liquid as shown in one video. It is a delight a have food here. This is from today is my favourite location when I need some soup for the soul. ü§©ü§©
7-Eleven (622 Upper Wellington St @ Brucedale),5,"Loved the ambience, service and food. We went for our anniversary dinner since we were craving Vietnamese food and wanted to try this place. We were very happy with the choice and it cost us much less than we had expected. My favorite menu item was the deep fried tofu. I already recommended it to my friends and I'll be back as well."
7-Eleven (622 Upper Wellington St @ Brucedale),5,"The moment you walk in you are greeted with a warm welcome. My family and I go here at least twice a week now. Lots of healthy food selection. My go to meal is bun (vermecelli) noodle with spring rolls, beef or chicken. The tea is also tasty! I feel like it‚Äôs a family owned restaurant which is always a good thing. Presentation is amazing compare to competitors. It‚Äôs more of a fine dining Vietnamese restaurant. I would definitely recommend this to my friends!"
7-Eleven (622 Upper Wellington St @ Brucedale),5,"Awesome Vietnamese place with fresh food and an exciting menu. A bit more expensive then other options in the city, however the flavour is worth it. I love vermicelli and there version was excellent. The fresh rolls were amazing and the peanut sauce is the best I've had yet. They also have a DIY fresh roll appetizer for multiple people that looks fun and delicious! Please check this place out. Recommend."
A&W (Upper James St),3,"Food is always great for a fast food place. Teen burgers all the way.  Wasn't happy about being charged for a BBQ sauce after asking for NO sauce on a chicken burger.  Not a fan of the idea of still paying for something removed and paying an additional amount to replace that item that was removed. I tried to explain this to the employee at the window but she just couldn't understand what I was talking about. Anyways, all in all, a bit better than average I guess."
A&W (Upper James St),1,"Worst customer experience ever! Just spent $60 only to have to girl taking my order act like fulfilling my order was too much hassle. It wasn‚Äôt busy , and I didn‚Äôt order anything odd.literally just burgers. Usually for a larger order I‚Äôm asked to wait in the designated parking spots and they bring out the order. No problem. This time I‚Äôm told to drive around and come through the drive through again in 10 minutes.  I ask if they could bring it out to their waiting spots. She says no, drive through.  Well in ten minutes the drive through is packed. I go to the window,  hoping to bypass the wait. The cashier sees me, shakes to head and tells me to drive through again. She‚Äôs rolling her eyes and giggling. There‚Äôs 3-4 I was in the staff inside. She‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt alone. $60 on burgers and they can‚Äôt take 30 seconds to walk it out to my car? Or even just pass it to me through the door? I‚Äôm sorry , but I think the staff was just being lazy. I come here 2-3x a month at least! So wait in the drive through I did , but I will never eat at this restaurant again."
A&W (Upper James St),5,"Ordered from here the other night for dinner. Haven't had A&W in forever, the quality never changes always delicious and satisfying. I ordered the double Mozza Burger it was very good and I also got fries and gravy with it too. The fries where nice and crispy, the gravy was thick and tasty. Also grabbed a couple double Buddy Burgers, they were delicious as well. Overall the meal was very good quality, tasty, and affordable. I'd definitely recommend their establishment."
A&W (Upper James St),3,We went just to try the frozen root beer.  We ordered in the drive through and we're told to wait in 1 of those spots for our order.  It took a long time (about 10 mins) just to get the drinks.  If this hadn't bee  such a long wait it probably would have been a better experience.  Get your fries seasoned--so much better üòã
A&W (Upper James St),1,"It was worst experience. I spent 47 dollars on food but the burgers I ordered from this location did not taste good, the onions on the sanwichs were disgusting and fries were not fresh, and they did not put even a single pack of ketchup on side in the bags while it was takeout oder. We were wait there more then half an hour for pickup the order. The girl gave me the order was in hurry ."
Subway (830 Upper James St),1,"I ordered through a delivery app last night. My particular issue is with salad that I paid over $13 for. For starters, there was not even enough meat in this salad for a 6 inch sub, yet you charged me over $13. Second, who puts the sauce on a salad when its being delivered? Now, that salad is soggy, so soggy and gross. On top of the fact the lettuce was already soggy. Then, you gave hardly any toppings, 2 cucumber slices, 3 pickle slices? This was the first time ordering from your store and it will be the last time I support it in any way. $13 and change for snack salad? Are you serious, and then everyone is wondering why people don't want to support their business anymore. I am thoroughly disgusted. And you make it so you can't make any notes, so I couldn't even ask for the sauce on the side. Use your common sense before you go out of business, because at this rate, it would be justified."
Subway (830 Upper James St),1,"Girl here working was so rude because I came during closing time. I know its frustrating if we come during closing time but you can‚Äôt treat customer like that. On website its showing you guys close at 2. Still I call her and I asked her at time you close she was like 1:45. We will not take order after 1:45. Last time when I came at that time manager/owner  was there, they took our order at 1:54. If you guys are not taking order after 1:45. Change time on website. Its weird."
Subway (830 Upper James St),1,May 27th 11:54 pm the girl that is working she probably is a goodworker but she kinda scammed me I asked for a crispy chicken footlong like I usually do and she took two pieces of chicken and cut it all into small pieces so there is barley any meat on my sandwich and basically is a salad on bread like bruh who cuts crispy chicken and also only puts 2 instead of the 4 pieces of chicken they always give. Unsatisfied
Subway (830 Upper James St),5,I come here often and get fantastic service every time!! my order is always perfect and I‚Äôd like to mention Parshva specifically for his above and beyond service.
Subway (830 Upper James St),2,"Mostly understaffed on busy nights, tip on the terminal (debit/visa) doesn't go to employees working there but rather to the owner. Same is the case with many stores where student labor is being used. Exploited by owners. Overall service and food is good."
Sunset Grill (1299 Barton St.),4,"I have been here a few times. The food is good but can be a bit on the pricey side for breakfast. We usually end up spending $40 for 2 of us, and that's before tip. I will say their Pancakes are delicious! The service is always good and and the food comes out quickly."
Sunset Grill (1299 Barton St.),4,I definitely will come back. Service is great and friendly. The food is good and good value. Service was surprisingly fast.  I had a good time
Sunset Grill (1299 Barton St.),4,"Servers were nice and the food was not sitting in a pool of grease! Ordered bacon, eggs and sausages and it was all cooked well and tasted fantastic.
Plenty of seating for you and your companions.
Very satisfied with our visit there

Update: This visit was equally as good as the previous, however the table had a bit of a damp film on it and when I wiped it, there was for sure a day or two old grime on there. This is probably just a one off as this is the first time I've had an issue though. Still will be going back to this location üëç"
Sunset Grill (1299 Barton St.),3,"I really like the eggs and toast and regular breakfast items. I had the breakfast poutine and it was really not great. Its a little pricey, but its open early in the morning.  Coffee is not the greatest $2.75 per cup which was wierd to me.  Over all 3 stars üåü ."
Sunset Grill (1299 Barton St.),5,What a gem of a place. Beautiful fresh coffee non stop. The menu is great and the food is awesome!  Love  all that work there. Friendly and pleasant!
Jet Cafe,5,"We got a seat right away, the service was good, a little bit of a wait, but the food makes up for it. Ordered off their iPad they gave us to send requests to the kitchen. Christmas decorations were still up, kinda cute. Food done to perfection, soup was amazing(wonton and spicy tempura), and the short ribs were to die for. The ice cream at the end was good."
Jet Cafe,5,"Quick pit stop on the road back to Montreal. My husband is amazing at finding these little gems of a breakfast place along our ways on road trips. Love the staff, love the prices, love the food, AMAZING!"
Jet Cafe,5,"I have been going to this family-run cafe for over 10 years. Dine-in or takeout, they never miss! Very affordable options. Their menu has something for everyone. Their specials will usually catch my attention. They have a lot of different coffee brews to choose from as well.

Their all day breakfast has been a classic for a long time. 2 eggs + choice of bacon OR sausage OR ham + buttered toast + hash-browns. Condiments and jam can be requested for free. The home fries are bomb.

A homey atmosphere and great service complete this all-day breakfast institution. They always do an amazing job, I only have positive things to say about Jet‚Äôs. 10/10"
Jet Cafe,5,"Very clean and spacious with lots of tables and chairs to dine in.
Staff is very friendly and helpful as they recommend good options.

Multiple good food to choose from.
French toast is very fluffy!
Eggs benedict is delicious. Lots of crispy potatoes as a side.

Nice art to look at throughout the restaurant too!"
Jet Cafe,5,"Cute lil place , my first time here today and it was somewhat confusing because I wasn‚Äôt aware you had to order at the front first , pay & then sit . But the girl helping me was super nice . I ordered fries and a BLT . The BLT came somewhat cold but the fries were decent :) I‚Äôm sure the breakfast would be better ."
Wimpy's Diner (Main Street),5,I ordered from here; as I was craving breakfast all morning! I feel like I haven‚Äôt had Wimpys in soooo long! The service was incredible; the lady was so kind and welcoming. The food was delicious; however I didn‚Äôt realize how large the portions actually were! 10 out of 10 recommend if you‚Äôre looking for breakfast lol! I think eating inside would be better then take out tho; unless you live/work relatively close by! (My food got soggy; my own fault for wanting something so far from work) Still delicious tho!
Wimpy's Diner (Main Street),5,"Wonderful! Warm! Welcoming!
My family and I had a perfect Sunday breakfast and we were given excellent service by the most attentive and exceptionally sweet Rose! The cheerful, welcoming diner was immaculate and our food was promptly served and coffees topped up without us even asking. Thank you for helping my family create a lovely Sunday memory ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Wimpy's Diner (Main Street),4,"Was passing by this location for so many times and finally decided to give it a try last Saturday, and it came out surprisingly good! The food and atmosphere was much beyond my expectations. Great place for a weekend brunch."
Wimpy's Diner (Main Street),5,Such a cute place with very friendly servers! This location is super big and has a lot of seating! The food was great for the price. Our server kept checking up on us and refilling our coffee even though there were also a lot of other tables. Their menu had a good selection and I really enjoyed my experience here! Would eat here again!
Wimpy's Diner (Main Street),5,We love coming to this location for breakfast! All of the servers are so kind and attentive. Food is always super delicious and hot. It‚Äôs always very clean here and we just love the atmosphere and the amazing service. The food is also very fresh every time.
Taste of Lagos,5,"Me and my family came here to dine yesterday evening and it was an absolutely amazing experience! The staff were so friendly, after greeting us with smiling faces they were quick to accommodate our needs, we had a group of 8 and everyone wanted to try everything so they provided us with a family style dining to make the experience that much more enjoyable. The dishes were truly authentic to Nigeria, the flavors, spices, and atmosphere made you taste and feel like you were in West Africa, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. In the heart of Hamilton they certainly contribute to the unique and diverse community that is James Street, I highly recommend anyone to try it out. Our favorite dishes were egusi with pounded yam, the jollof rice ofcourse, the fish was absolutely to die for and perfectly paired with zoba drink. We will absolutely be back and will be recommending to our friends and family."
Taste of Lagos,5,"It's rare that you come across food that makes your heart smile. I've never had taste of Lagos, but this place can bring those true spices of Nigeria to life. Food is sooo good that your taste buds start dancing to the beats of this place. Never tasted such a tender chicken, the rice is bright yet speaks of volume about the chef's magic.

The atmosphere is soothing, your life takes a spin past that entrance door. Welcomed by a team who speaks from heart, and serves with passion. No wonder why they been listed in multiple times in popular pages like Hamilton spectator.

The spectacular service is nothing like I've seen before, it's served with a certain tone of love! It makes you fall in love with place just as the food. I find that this is one of the most underrated place in Hamilton. This is what I like about local business, they put their heart and soul to provide the best one could possibly offer. It's so original that you can feel it through their food and service. This is what makes you eat with confidence.

Tolagos! You've went beyond what meets the eyes!
This is it, my go to place for rich tasty food!

This is insane! Insane that I can't preach this enough!!! Thank you for making Hamilton proud!"
Taste of Lagos,5,"My sister recommended this place and nobody‚Äôs food has made me smile from the first bite to the last like this place. My coleslaw was forgotten but the food made me forget it instantly. Nonetheless, 10s across the board!!! From the flavour of the fried rice to the tenderness of the goat meat, I was impressed; this is a place I will definitely be ordering from again!"
Taste of Lagos,5,"I am always proud to see Nigerian entrepreneurs like Funmise & Victoria doing their  thing. I enjoyed the food so much that I will be returning to purchase more from them.
Taste of Lagos does a good job of bringing Nigerian flavours to Hamilton.
Great job, keep up the good work!"
Taste of Lagos,5,The best place for African food in Hamilton hands-down. Their stews are spiced perfectly and their portions are great. Definitely my go to place when I'm craving good african food.
On the Run 42366 | 1160 Fennell Ave E,5,First time dining here. The waitress was very friendly. She even offered a new coffee as our current one was cold as we were waiting for cream. Food was absolutely delicious too. I would recommend this place & definitely visit again!
On the Run 42366 | 1160 Fennell Ave E,5,"Steady and true. Always good food in a friendly place. Prices still reasonable, good value and no unpleasant surprises. Enjoyed coming here for decades and hope it never changes. A lot of restaurants could take a lesson from Aces."
On the Run 42366 | 1160 Fennell Ave E,5,"I went here a couple weeks ago for breakfast. I got the bacon omlette served with toast, and home fries. The bacon omlette was pretty good I'd recommend getting cheese in it. It was really filling. The home fries were cut different than traditional home fries, they were thick and octagon shaped, I'd personally prefer smaller and crisper home fries but to each their own. The waitress was very kind and attentive and came back a couple times to refill our coffee's and ask us if we needed anything else. The atmosphere was quiet and comfortable, and clean. I'd definitely eat here again."
On the Run 42366 | 1160 Fennell Ave E,2,"EXCELLENT service and GREAT (economical) priced, but the food was ... boring, lacked any flavor and just overall bland.

Without a doubt, you'd be hard pressed to find better service than here, not only was the lady who attended our table polite, engaging and QUICK (yea, food came incredibly fast - hot too). free cup of coffee x 2 with a combo and big portions. Just wish it had some hint of tasting good.

The sausages where spongy and oozed fat when busted open... and what the jail is this kind of side potatoes? I understand you try to stand out.. but it's just potato, leave harsh browns to be hashbrowns man. Even the fried onions couldn't salvage things.

Can't recommend until they work on the actual food (breakfast)."
On the Run 42366 | 1160 Fennell Ave E,5,"We eat here weekly! ..and love it. The food is home-cooked and excellent.
Fish and chips is excellent, cooked perfectly, in my opinion best in Hamilton..and we have tried Harry's, Parkdale, and Hutches.
Other food we have ordered and is excellent are the Burgers, poutine (my hubby had 3 this week !!üôÑ), clubhouse, the breakfasts, chicken fingers, and soups."
Hasty Market (Kenilworth Ave N),3,"Would for sure need to stop in and try the Alfredo pasta fresh in shop ... Did not make it to me like so. That being said, curry chicken was on point üòÅ. I will be back - mayhap when I'm closer üòå!"
Hasty Market (Kenilworth Ave N),1,"Owner and employees are very unprofessional. Food has no flavour, can definitely find Caribbean food somewhere else. No hospitality or customer service either. 0/5 stars if I could."
Hasty Market (Kenilworth Ave N),5,This restaurant came highly recommended! Ordered food for my moms birthday here and it did not disappoint. Best food in Hamilton.
Hasty Market (Kenilworth Ave N),5,"It's definite yes for the food! It's the best spot for Caribbean food in Hamilton! I highly recommend. It's a great spot for drinks, conversation and music"
Hasty Market (Kenilworth Ave N),1,"You can call the owner again if you want to sniff a good drug, it's true that Tylenol was mixed in with the last purchase...
Don't do this again brother."
Sunnyside Grill,5,Fantastic place for breakfast or anything really! We came here with the whole family and everybody loved it. More than the food tasting delicious the service was great. Fast and friendly. Probably some of the best prices around town for a big plate of food!
Sunnyside Grill,1,"PLASTIC IN SMOOTHIE!
I ordered a breakfast through doordash, and a tropical smoothie. I immediately noticed black gunk at the top and pick it out with a spoon.
I called the restaurant and asked about what it was and was told it was the mango skin. I found another large hunk of the same thing closer to the bottom. Upon closer examination it was PLASTIC from what appeared to be the bag they package the food in! It‚Äôs as if they blended a plastic bag up along with the fruit!
Can definitely say I won‚Äôt ever be eating here!"
Sunnyside Grill,4,"Understaffed for how busy it is on Sunday. However service was pleasant and food came out quickly.

Bacon is very thin but crispy. Ham was very thin/processed slices. Pancakes are fantastic. Eggs I asked cooked over hard and it‚Äôs one of the few places that doesn‚Äôt break the yolk to speed up cooking - awesome.

Overall breakfast was delicious. My daughter had the fish and chips and although it looked a bit over cooked she loved how crispy it was and the taste.

I like how the tables aren‚Äôt crammed together and there‚Äôs plenty of space. Overall quite pleased. Will return."
Sunnyside Grill,1,"The worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant. It was not overly busy and we waited 45 minutes for basic meals like an omellete, eggs and pancakes. Our server came to our table only once during that time, unbelievable ! Finally after asking another server, our meals arrived. My daughter had to send her poached eggs back twice ! We asked for a manager, who immediately went on the defensive, arguing that a new cook started that day, it's busy ... busy ?? It was half empty ! What an attitude she had. Arguing, making lame excuses and extremely unprofessional. Also our server never returned. The service was horrible, manager was rude and ignorant and the food was just okay. She offered a 10% discount, not good enough ! She then offered a 40 % discount ... we accepted and got out. I have no problem paying any amount for great service, experience and meal ... in this case we should have been paid for the waste of our time. First and last time there !!"
Sunnyside Grill,4,"Sunnyside Grill was a delight to dine at. üòä
I enjoyed the Poached California (as seen on the 1st and 2nd photo). It is one of Sunnyside Grill's favourites. Which is Hollandaise over bacon and avocado on an English muffin along with a great amount of their Country Griddled Potatoes. üç≥

It is a cute little diner in a small neighborhood of Hamilton, Ontario.

Thank you for the nice service."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (1400 Upper James St. Unit # 10),5,"Everything on the menu is a 10/10. My favorite thing to order is the skillet. 8 of us went for brunch on a Saturday, make sure you have reservations or you'll end up waiting 45mins for a table. Patrick was our waiter and he was excellent. He was extremely tentative, friendly and fast. This location is great!"
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (1400 Upper James St. Unit # 10),5,"Place is great . Food is brought fast after you
Order . Staff are around constantly for coffee refills . And best of all  the menu has such a variety it‚Äôs hard to choose ."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (1400 Upper James St. Unit # 10),4,"Pancake and eggs are excellent! The bread was kind hard and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the way of the bread but I don‚Äôt like it‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs 4/5

Good service. Good place to start your day."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (1400 Upper James St. Unit # 10),4,This place is never disappointing for breakfast. Only drawback when we were there was my samon benedict did not exactly match the picture showing. A little bit disappointed with the fruits. And whatever their mango cranberry juice tasted awful!
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (1400 Upper James St. Unit # 10),5,"I took my friend today for breakfast
We enjoyed it very much. Our server was super amazing, friendly and helpful. We tried the blueberry fields and waffles with a hint of vanilla in them which made the flavour pop!
We had coffee refill, the strawberry banana French toast was particularly delicious üòã
We highly recommend this place."
Denny's Canada (560 Centennial Parkway North),4,"I feel a little torn doing this review ... the gentleman that was doing all the front line work in the restaurant was very kind, beyond polite and tried very hard to make things right with us ... the food was tasty, although some of it wasn't as hot as it could have been ... starters were brought out after the main course in some cases and to be honest the wait time from ordering to delivery was beyond unacceptable. We stayed at the hotel near the restaurant for a couple days and visited Denny's for supper both evenings ... the first night just the two of us, the second night 6 of us. Neither time was the restaurant busy ... first night 2 other tables in there, 2nd night one table other then ours.  We waited about 30 minutes for our meal after ordering the 1st night and well over an hour the 2nd night. If it had been busy it might have been understandable but as mentioned it was not. 3 people with us the second night had been there numerous times before, one said it had been her favourite restaurant until that night ... they commented it was usually packed, service quick and the food delicious. They had been there in the summer and stated it wasn't the way it was the night we had been there. They didn't recognize the staff that had been there the 2 nights we'd been there. That all being said the gentleman gave each of us a 10% off coupon good for the next visit and 4 of the 6 of us were given dessert on the house. He was very gracious in trying to make the situation better.  Not sure if they are new owners but I hope they get it figured out if they are ... the lack of customers isn't going to keep the doors open long no matter how good the food is. Timely service is just as important."
Denny's Canada (560 Centennial Parkway North),5,We were greeted and seated promptly. Our server came over quickly to provide us with water. She was extremely friendly and efficient at her job. The food arrived quickly. It was hot and delicious! The location was clean and nicely decorated. Absolutely delicious breakfast and atmosphere!
Denny's Canada (560 Centennial Parkway North),3,"the food is ok, not sure why there‚Äôs barely any pancake options when it‚Äôs a breakfast spot. seems to me that they have more stuff on lunch/ dinner options. the service is fairly fast, and my server Aisha was very accommodating and so nice, even though i wasn‚Äôt satisfied with my meal. it also seems to me that they made the pancakes smaller for some reason, not bad for the price though."
Denny's Canada (560 Centennial Parkway North),5,Came in around 530 for a quick bite and to take a break from the traffic on the highway. Was not disappointed. Had strawberry pancake puppies and the old faithful moons over my hammy. Both were delicious. Gagan was a great sever. I will be back!
Denny's Canada (560 Centennial Parkway North),4,"Went to Denny‚Äôs for the $9.99 grand slam special. I absolutely love their pancakes!! They are large and fluffy, definitely the best I‚Äôve ever had. Unfortunately the rest of the breakfast was bland , bacon was paper thin , sausage was super small and hash browns just didn‚Äôt cut it. We also tried the milkshakes and they were good basic milkshakes. Our server was not very attentive and disappeared for a bit until we were done. However I did see people enjoying large sized burgers and sandwiches with fries which looked very good. I DO recommend Denny‚Äôs for basic good food."
Stacked Pancake & Breakfast House (Stoney Creek),3,"I have to be honest, the place is rather average. The dining room is nice, the service is good but the food is just OK, I didn't care for it much. We tried 2 standard breakfast options and both were rather generic nothing and not worth retiring for. It's ok if you're looking for a quick bite while shopping nearby but not good enough to take a detour."
Stacked Pancake & Breakfast House (Stoney Creek),5,"There were 7 of us so we were happy you could accommodate us on a day and time we knew it would be busy.
Not sure of the man's name who served us (dark hair), but he was friendly and great with my kids too. That was awesome!
Food came out quick, was delicious, and very fairly priced.
This morning the kids asked when we can go again!
We're definitely looking forward to our next breakfast/brunch at your location!
Thanks!"
Stacked Pancake & Breakfast House (Stoney Creek),4,The food here is great. The pancake stack breakfast is so affordable for how much food you get! The cinnamon roll pancakes are a must. Our server Madelyn was so friendly and nice! Very quick service even though they were packed.
Stacked Pancake & Breakfast House (Stoney Creek),3,"The food was pretty decent and the prices were great! I would highly recommend the French toast and pancakes! However their chicken wrap was really dry and cold, so will definitely skip this next time. The waitress was really friendly and quick, but the one thing the restaurant should definitely look into is why the lady at the front took over 10 minutes to come to the front to greet and seat us. We were not the only ones waiting, there was another family ahead of us, however no one seemed to care. Overall the experience was pretty good aside from that!"
Stacked Pancake & Breakfast House (Stoney Creek),4,We ordered take out at work recently with an online order and there were no issues. I had the Stacked hash with eggs over easy  and it was good and could feed three people. The free birthday cake pancake was pretty good too. I'd eat here again as the menu is pretty extensive.
P√ºr & Simple (Ancaster),4,"Tips: during weekends, always join their waitlist on Google map at least 1 hr ahead of your planned time.

The food was not bad and we both ordered skillet egg with or without meat on bed of their signature potatoes. Ordered egg and meat kid breakfast and added a pancake for extra 5 dollar.

The food was okay. Our daughter liked the sausage and the pancake and ate a couple potatoes. Overall, good for a brunch with kids if you like simple egg, meat, sandwich, rolls breakfast. :)"
P√ºr & Simple (Ancaster),4,"P√ºr & Simple offers a wide variety of brunch options, including classics such as eggs benedict, pancakes, waffles, omelettes, burgers, and wraps. My wife and I appreciated the variety, but we did find that the restaurant could benefit from including more vegetarian options on their menu (we couldn't find anything vegan on the menu if I remember correctly). However, the restaurant's coffee was exceptional and we were informed that is made from Nespresso. While it wasn't the best espresso I've had, the caramel cappuccino was definitely my favorite.

Our server was very friendly and helpful throughout our meal, which contributed to a pleasant dining experience. The prices were also reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food and service.

Overall, if you're looking for a brunch spot with a lot of options and excellent coffee, P√ºr & Simple is definitely worth checking out. However, if you're a vegetarian or vegan, you may want to consider other options, as the menu could use more plant-based choices."
P√ºr & Simple (Ancaster),5,"We ordered two Benedict, Angus and Santa Fe (at $18 each), both of which tasted great! Very friendly servers, nice environment. I would recommend this place."
P√ºr & Simple (Ancaster),5,"Went to this breakfast place on a whim with my wife and we were blown away!

The food was delicious, the service was prompt, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the restaurant instead was clean and very well-designed.

I honestly can‚Äôt think of a single negative, so if anyone is looking for a new place to try, check out P√ºr and Simple.

I know I‚Äôll be back! 10/10"
P√ºr & Simple (Ancaster),5,"My favorite brunch restaurant in the neighborhood! I have been there three times and every time I enjoyed it! The food was amazing, everything was so fresh. The servers were super nice! Kind of the routine to start my weekend now!"
Dairy Queen (1015 Golf Links Rd),5,Was served by Jack Hines excellent and very supportive towards me and the other customers in this establishment. Would recommend a promotion. Floor was dirty until Jack Hines took the initiative to clean the floor
Dairy Queen (1015 Golf Links Rd),1,"Bought the smartie pizza. Asked if it was gluten free, was told yes. Get  home had dinner bring it out and bam! My daughter didn't have birthday cake on her birthday because it's not gluten free. So disappointing for her and me of course."
Dairy Queen (1015 Golf Links Rd),4,Great friendly service. I have never received a poorly made ice cream. Small place and sometimes a long wait but seems worth it.
Dairy Queen (1015 Golf Links Rd),5,It was my 50th and an ice cake was bought for me by my friends and I haven't tasted one before. Oh my God! I enjoyed every bit of it. I was like it shouldn't finish!
Dairy Queen (1015 Golf Links Rd),5,"On April 10th I called the Ancaster Dairy Queen looking for a gluten free cake.  My son was turning 10 the next day and ice cream cake was his request.  They had no gf cakes available but said they can make one but require 24 hours notice.  They informed me that, unfortunately, I had just missed the cut off because it was closing time.  I completely understood and said I'd figure something else out.  The gracious and lovely angel on the line said ""No, no.  Wait.  I'll stay late.  I'll put it together now.  I know how hard it is to find gf cake options"". Above and beyond! We're very grateful and can't recommend enough."
Little Caesars (Rymal Road),1,"I purchased a Medium Pepperoni Stuffed Pretzel Crust Pizza with Cheese Sauce for a total of $15.81. Unfortunately, my experience with the pizza was terrible. It was incredibly salty, and even when I tried removing some of the salt, it did not improve the taste. I feel like I wasted my money on this pizza. The picture clearly shows the excessive amount of white salt on the pizza, and it begs the question of whether such an amount is necessary. Is this the standard amount that should be used on a pizza? In my opinion, definitely not. I had an awful experience with this pizza and would never recommend it or try it again."
Little Caesars (Rymal Road),5,"First off the service was amazing, I had a birthday party order that I messed up on the date of pick up ( 1 week ) I showed up and my food wasn't ready because of my mess up. The staff had my order ready fresh in under 8 minutes. Very accommodating, friendly and understanding.

The food was great, fresh and tasted good.

I highly recommend this location."
Little Caesars (Rymal Road),5,"This is the best Little C's in the city. It's $6 pizza - you can't expect much but its always hit or miss with locations. This location CONSISTENTLY makes cheesy, saucy pizza hot out of the oven. Its never dry and its always cheesy. The staff's customer service is fantastic as well. Whoever the owner is- you've got a great team."
Little Caesars (Rymal Road),5,"Ordered dinner from here the other night. Great wings nicely cooked and flavored nice! The meat lovers pizza was done too perfection and tasted great! I wish they had better options for dips I'm not too crazy about ranch, I'm more a creamy garlic or cheddar habanero dipper. Other than that it was fast quick delivery, everything was delicious and hot! I recommend them! The pics of the pizza have sriracha sauce on them I love it hot üî• lol"
Little Caesars (Rymal Road),3,"Normally  it‚Äôs terrific!! But got a deep dish last night that wasn‚Äôt cooked all the way. raw dough is a no goü§¢
So figured I‚Äôd try again ‚Ä¶ pizza was cooked   And tasty my only fault with it was  horribly sliced. Some Super small slices"
Toronto Pho (Hamilton),5,"Food and drinks are always great here. Today we ordered Chicken and shrimp pad Thai. Picture of the food is after eating half of it. Fresh rolls are great. Favorite drink is the honeydew with aloe Vera.

Well worth the try."
Toronto Pho (Hamilton),4,"I eat Pho quite regularly, for it it was something of a a bit of a comfort that was left over from university. I have tried a few dishes at the Toronto Pho for me what makes Pho good that its good value for the price. Eating here a few times I get a sense of when its good and when there is a bit of opportunities. For example, I remember eating here with my friend and having the noodles stuck to the bottom of the bowl. I know this was not big deal but it is not a good ascetic when you are actual noodles are stuck to the bottom of the bowl. For this reason I actually prefer to get the Pho for take out, as everything is separated into portions, and you get to manage the over quality of the presentation yourself. I highly recommend this place for take out, but having it at the restaurant is not much of an experience. It's nice for a stop in but the restaurant for sitting in is not to special. Very good fresh rolls. The price for Pho for me is a bit over priced"
Toronto Pho (Hamilton),3,"Toronto Pho is a Vietnamese restaurant located in Hamilton that offers generous serving sizes for it‚Äôs price ranges. While the portions are certainly a positive aspect of the restaurant, it is unfortunate to that the taste may be lacking. It‚Äôs a little bland for my liking. We ordered the spring rolls, vermicelli noodles and pad Thai. As a person came from Toronto and have tried multiple Vietnamese restaurants the spring rolls and the vermicelli sauce is definitely lacking. However, it is important to note that taste is subjective, and what one person finds bland, another may find flavourful but not for me and my partner. It may be worth trying other dishes on the menu, or requesting additional seasoning or spices to enhance the flavor of the vermicelli‚Äôs and spring rolls. But I don‚Äôt see myself or my parents going back to this places. Overall, Toronto Pho in Hamilton seems to offer good value for money in terms of portion size, but the taste may leave something to be desired."
Toronto Pho (Hamilton),5,"Really good bubble tea! If you're in the area and craving a sweet drink, I recommend the bubble tea here! My selection is the brown sugar milk tea - but if you want something super refreshing, the fruity explosion is delicious as well!"
Toronto Pho (Hamilton),5,"Best Pho so far in Hamilton. Broth is extremely flavorful, noodles are fresh and the included noodles and meat were plenty. I was used to other places that give a lot less, so I ordered extra noodles and extra rare beef. The extra noodles were about 500g, and the extra beef was about 200g on top of the already included was enough for 4 people. Will be going back for sure."
Cupcakes,3,"It was okay, but the flavours were not balanced correctly, in my opinion. The brownie was quite oily (but extremely moist because of that), and didn't have a strong chocolate flavour. The icing was tasteless. The eclair pastry was fresh and homemade tasting, but the icing was super sweet and the filling under sweet. The icing was like chocolate cake icing, not like an eclair icing. The meringues, I tossed after trying. The white one with chocolate chips was way too sweet. The lemon one wasn't, but it wasn't worth eating. I came to this place because of the great ratings and because I wanted to try their sticky buns or cinnamon buns. The sweet buns were not available when I arrived. I hate to give this star level for a bakery's review, but it is my honest opinion. I would try this place again (if I was in the area) to try their sticky buns because I enjoyed their eclair pastry, but I wouldn't rebuy the sweets I already purchased.

Products: pies (dessert), pies (dinner) like chicken pot pie, bars, cupcakes, cake, butter tarts, meringues, eclairs, mini cheesecakes, croissants, scones, sticky buns, banana bread, loaves of bread, pop, juice, and water bottles.

Dining options: Takeout and --I assume-- pre-order.

Tips: If you want a jaw dropping brownie, try Eric the Baker's or Decadently Yours caramel brownie in Guelph.

Parking: They have street parking and a parking lot beside it.

Wheelchair accessibility: There is a sidewalk in front. See my pics. I forgot to check if they have a wheelchair button. It is completely accessible indoors, no steps inside."
Cupcakes,5,"Never disappoints have had quite a few treats from here. Today, it was lemon pie.
Delicious, give this place a try"
Cupcakes,5,"Weil‚Äôs/Isabel did our wedding cake and donuts for our reception. They were outstanding. Isabel was always very prompt in responding to our emails. Isabel executed our vision perfectly. She found florals and greenery that matched our colours to a tee. And of course the Weil‚Äôs cakes ‚Äî carrot cake, lemon cake and vanilla with raspberry buttercream ‚Äî and donuts were delicious. I can‚Äôt get over how light and flavourful the lemon cake and the vanilla cake were and yet still supportive enough for a three tier wedding cake (the proper dowels were inserted in). The raspberry buttercream and raspberry dip donuts especially were so fresh and tasty. Weil‚Äôs certainly lived up to their reputation for our wedding. (Photographer: Zekar Photography Studio, Hamilton)"
Cupcakes,5,"As a newbie to  Hamilton (visiting from London England) I was searching for a good bakery and having had read positive reviews about Weil‚Äôs Bakery, i decided to give it a try, and Wow! What a great bakery. Their products are delicious! Weil‚Äôs peanut better, oatmeal raisin cookies are delicious. Equally good are the feta and cheese ‚Äúcroissants‚Äù (square shaped pastries) and the cheddar cheese scones. The customer service is outstanding, they are super friendly and welcoming. In short, I have become a fan of Weil‚Äôs bakery and recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable bakery with quality and moorish  baked goods!! Thank you Weils for making my trip to Hamilton comforting!"
Cupcakes,5,"My husband and I purchased two cakes for our intimate, immediate family only wedding - one regular, the other gluten-free. Both were absolutely delicious and beautifully decorated! They arrived perfectly on schedule and our cake table was even decorated with some flowers and leaves to match the cake. We would definitely recommend Weil's of Westdale Bakery for any occasion!"
I heart Boba,5,"Omg yummmm! The best pad Thai I‚Äôve ever had! Got it to go, so the picture doesn‚Äôt do it justice. Definitely would recommend! So flavourful and large portion too!"
I heart Boba,4,"This is some of the best thai food around!  Most people tend to get take out.  Dine in service needs some improvement as they never really check on you once you're served.   Other than that, they are fast and friendly.  Try the house specials."
I heart Boba,1,"I used to really like ordering from here but it seems like they're missing all the important details from my orders these days.

Aside from missed items in my orders sometimes, the one that really bothers me the most is the lack of attention to the notes (Uber Eats). I always ask for extra hoisin sauce as that's an important part of my pho experience. Not only did I not receive any extra hoisin sauce today, I just didn't even receive the standard inclusion of hoisin/hot sauce at all - nothing at all. This might seem like a small issue but it literally happens during 90% of my orders and I've ordered from here at least 30 times in the last year. Never again.

Do you know where I've had a great experience? The new pho place in Waterdown, Pho Viet T&T. The broth isn't as good but I'd rather get less tasty broth since they actually read notes and provide extra hoisin sauce."
I heart Boba,5,"This is one of my favorite places to go to for great Asian food. Nothing is overly priced, we get well over what we expect each time and we have never had a bad experience there! The people there are super friendly and helpful and always welcome us in. This is a great restaurant for families, couples, and friends. You can go there for lunch or dinner and you will not be disappointed. 100% would recommend!"
I heart Boba,1,"Got them Sunday, Dec 5th , 2021. Ordered the house special which is to include Shrimp , Beef , Chicken and vegetables on a bed of noodles. There was 1 piece of shaved beef 1 small piece of chicken and 3 shrimp. MEAT lovers should avoid this stingy restaurant, you will be paying for just noodles for 15.99$.

Called them to see what they could offer because of this dissatisfying meal.
The lady argued with me (basically saying I was lying) , and then she offered a ""sorry"" .... I asked her what she was going to do about it?
She said they weigh out and give the same amount to everyone. I then told her that , if this is what she serves everyone then that's extremely cheap. She said I should call her back later cause she's busy and said she won't do anything about either way......
This is legitimately my first time ever complaining about any restaurant , so no ""Karen's "" here.
Avoid this place , horrible customer service and terrible quality !!!"
Mahal Restaurant,1,"I've never had a butter chicken taste like pure maple syrup, but here we are. It was so sweet. The website says its cooked to Canadian tastes...i honestly wish i was kidding. It was inedible. Veg samosas are half empty (see picture) and mostly tasteless. 1 star for the Naan I guess? I will not return, save your money and go elsewhere."
Mahal Restaurant,3,"We ordered their tandoori chicken and beef nihari for the first time through uber eats. Unfortunately, our experience was not great. Although, the service was prompt and good considering the presentation and amount of food they provided. But the taste wasn't good at all, it was very ordinary as if you could do better by cooking those yourself. The tandoori lacked basic spicy and masala. The beef nihari wasn't actually a nihari, it was just simply a broth or soup. I wanted to give them 1 star, but giving them a chance so that they are going to improve themselves by considering the feedback."
Mahal Restaurant,3,"Had heard a lot about the Lahori fish...the restaurant is not really a place for dining in, but good for takeout.
Since I am a pretty good cook myself, I did reverse engineer the fish. And it's OK.
They were busy though"
Mahal Restaurant,4,"This place is a dive but an amazing stop for some takeout halal Indian/Pakistani food. Service is excellent when the owner is there otherwise, it is a hit or miss. One of my favourite places in town! Chicken biryani is a must (make sure to tell them your spice level other wise don't complain that it's too hot)"
Mahal Restaurant,5,I ordered the steamed rice with chicken tika masala which is spicy if your into that. Delicious food. I love the nan bread. Definitely worth it. I would recommend it to anyone. You can also check out masalas which is another great restaurant especially if you like vegan food.
Mike's Submarines,1,"The service was horrible. The male owner of the store was rude and very disrespectful towards his staff and customers.  My husband asked for extra onions on his sub and the owner told him he would have to pay extra for them. The customer that was behind my husband asked for extra onions and the owner told her "" for you, no problem."" When my husband asked why he had to pay extra for the onions and the other customer did not he was told that if he didn't like it to go to the subway down the street. The poor kid that was making our subs was shaking. I felt so bad for the young man that was working there.  We have been a long time customer of this establishment but I will never return to this one. And I will be telling others about his arrogance."
Mike's Submarines,1,"Been going to Mikes for 20+ years and their subs are delicious but this location is less than impressive,  showed up at 7:30 when they close at 8 and it was already closed. Not to mention the staff is nowhere near as good as the fennel location when they are open. Always had a great experience and amazing subs at fennel, don't waste your time going to this location"
Mike's Submarines,1,"‚ÄúIf you want to customize your sub go to Subway‚Äù is what the workers to my wife. They were so rude when you asked to make changes to the sub on the menu.

Not sure why it matters what you want on your sub, shouldn‚Äôt you like what you are eating instead of it being an inconvenience to the workers‚Ä¶.stay away if you want any changes to the menu."
Mike's Submarines,5,"Ordered some subs for a party! Everything was fresh, delicious and a huge hit. Very affordable and plenty of variety. Would order again in a heartbeat! Thanks Mike‚Äôs Subs!"
Mike's Submarines,5,"The sub I got was great! Tasted amazing, veggies were fresh. I actually finished the whole thing, which I never do !"
Gino's Pizza (640 Mohawk Rd W),4,"Overall: 7 / 10
Solid pie and the best place to eat in this mall. Friendly service. Fair prices. $4 for a large slice (the size of 2) or $10.99 for a 1-topping XL (walk-in). Recommended because the smaller size pizzas end up with a much thicker crust. The medium ends up almost like a pan pizza, while the XL ends up like a thin chewy NY style.

Crust: 7 / 10
Nice crust, chewy, soft, but not too sloppy and soggy. Really nice that it holds up to the amount of sauce and toppings they use. It's especially good when really hot and fresh, so eating in the mall is a good idea.

Sauce: 6 / 10
I like a place where you get a lot of sauce, no need to order extra. It's simple but effective. If you order extra sauce and a medium pizza with double pepperoni, you'll get something quite good (almost like Chicago Style with the amount of sauce and topping).

Cheese: 6.5 / 10
Good cheese and a fair amount.

Toppings: 6.5 / 10
Standard pepperoni and toppings with no issues of quality or quantity."
Gino's Pizza (640 Mohawk Rd W),1,"Placed an order online, after waiting 20 minutes they call saying I entered my address incorrectly and the order was canceled. I entered my address correctly, their website is garbage. In the conformation email it has MY postal code I entered however the lady on the phone told me the system automatically changed my postal code. They sent my order to a different store now, but after 20 minutes, my order should be half done by now not just starting.

TLDR, took them 20 minutes to call me so now I'm waiting an extra 20 minutes"
Gino's Pizza (640 Mohawk Rd W),5,"Been going here for years,,great place to grab a HUGE  piece when you're on the go. Pizza is always tasty and hot. So if you need a quick bite or a great meal , hit this place up. And make sure to say hello,,the staff are quite friendly."
Gino's Pizza (640 Mohawk Rd W),4,"Good pizza and some good pick up specials for this location.

Overall if your in the area some decent pizza and a good price for pickup

Easy to get to for parking at mall"
Gino's Pizza (640 Mohawk Rd W),5,I get pizza from here all the time. Tastes great! Good prices. I love their dip too! üòª
Pho Dui Bo (Stoney Creek),5,"Don't think twice about diving into this restaurant experience because out of all my Google reviews this establishment really stands out.

It's a no nonsense restaurant set up to serve many happy customers at once.

The service is fast, friendly and the food comes out fresh and tasting delicious.

I order #600 on the menu and the soft spring rolls with shrimp are awesome!

Well done you master Pho'ers"
Pho Dui Bo (Stoney Creek),5,Super yummy food. Really quick and good service. Big portions for a really good price. Love it here.
Pho Dui Bo (Stoney Creek),5,"Walked in,was greeted and sat right away. Server was quick to come over with menus and water. Service was extremely quick and staff were very friendly. This is definitely one of the better broths I‚Äôve had as there was not a lot of oil but still a good amount of flavour! You get a good amount of noodles and meat! Extremely pleased with my experience here and would definitely recommend. Great prices too!"
Pho Dui Bo (Stoney Creek),4,"I have been to many Pho places this is one of good ones. I had a soup and vegetable rolls( need to improve on those) - had crispy tofu, lettuce and noodles in it + can be made bit more better.  The soup quantity was good"
Pho Dui Bo (Stoney Creek),4,Tried a new soup w seafood #210...ordered semi spicy...was delicious
The Hearty Hooligan,5,"Tried for first time yesterday with my wife and son.

Really funky atmosphere walking in, as a 80‚Äôs baby all the retro stuff really hit nicely.

Immediately greeted by the friendly staff and seated right away. He dropped off some menus for us and gave us a moment for deciding on drinks. I went with the signature angry redhead and my wife got wine.

The angry redhead was amazing.

Ordered Mac and cheese for my kid, and my wife and I split the nachos and dill fries and we got the pepperoni and cheese pizza pockets.

Fantastic meal, left with full bellies.

Been a while since I felt that the service and food was worth the price. I definitely felt that here."
The Hearty Hooligan,5,"Absolutely delicious! I have been there many times and have always been amazed at how delicious the items are! The pizza pockets are so far my favourite meal. The cookies and cupcakes (especially the lavender one) are to die for! I love this place and will continue coming back! Great, positive and friendly environment as well."
The Hearty Hooligan,5,What a rustic vegan restaurant experience! You can tell when you walk in here that these people are the real deal. There's a sense of comfort and finding people you have a lot in common with. What's there not to like. The food was really good. It is self-proclaimed vegan junk food but many if not all is homemade. The food here's certainly decadent and my son and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The desserts were really delicious although we just had cookies and the one that we ate was so good we ended up taking home a dozen. If you're vegan and you're in the area this is a must stop.
The Hearty Hooligan,5,"Stopped in for a quick bite on the way home from center mall. The crunchwrap and housemade lemonade were both fantastic. Almost forgot to get a picture of my food, it was that good. The staff were all friendly and the vibes/music are great (especially if you like the Simpsons)"
The Hearty Hooligan,5,"Today was my second time at this delicious plant based hot spot and everything was amazing! From the deco to the energy and the food, the place is amazing and a must when in Hamilton! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Very grateful for a restaurant that doesn‚Äôt exploit nonhuman animals and proves that plant based food is so incredibly yummy! üôèüèΩ"
Beavertails (Kingston),5,A terrific spot to enjoy authentic Beavertails. A great selection and very tasty.  The place is well decorated and designed to a A Canadian theme.  Very tidy inside and out. The staff are very friendly and courteous.  You will have to stop here when in Kingston.
Beavertails (Kingston),5,"I love this place. The ambient, the pastries, and the staff are all amazing. Highly recommend.
My favourite flavour is Bananrama (chocolate hazelnut spread with banana pieces). The owner, Haider, is amazing and a very nice person. We had nice time chatting. The kids enjoyed the pastries and the ice cream. If you are around in the town and crave for some sweat stuff, go and try BeaverTails. And yes, their coffee is good too.
I will definitely come back to this place again when I visit Kingston."
Beavertails (Kingston),5,"We absolutely loved eating at this BeaverTails location. I must say we had very low expectations considering it's a chain but I'm glad we decided to stop by. The staff was amazing and gave us great suggestions about what to order.

We ended up having the Bananarama beavertail (nutella + banana) since it seemed to be their most popular option. It was crunchy outside and soft on the inside and the toppings matched really well together. We also ordered the poutine and I must say it's one of the best poutines I've ever had. We shared a Beaverdog and we were surprised by how good it tasted. Just keep in mind that they only have ketchup and mustard as toppings for it, but it didn't need more than that in my opinion.

Looking forward to coming back!"
Beavertails (Kingston),5,"We came here 2 days in a row. That's how you know it's good!!  The service is quick, despite it being so busy. We ordered the classic and Killaloe Sunrise. The beavertail was soft and crunchy.  For the Killaloe Sunrise, they only add a piece of lemon to make it different from the classic. The classic is just cinnamon and sugar on top. I thought the batter would be made with lemon, but it wasn't. The only lemon flavor came from squeezing the lemon on the cinnamon and sugar flavored beavertail.

I love Beavertails, so I will definitely be back."
Beavertails (Kingston),3,Your average beavertails! Located in a lovely area to walk around with your beavertails in hand. The atmosphere was rather dark. The service was alright! Took a bit of time to make.
La Luna (Concession Street),4,"Food is always amazing, fresh. The building and seating could use a little facelift, but otherwise it's still one of my favorite places to eat!"
La Luna (Concession Street),4,Needs a bit of work for dine in but food makes up for it. A bit cold so bring a sweater if eating in. The share plates are all so good! One of our go tos.
La Luna (Concession Street),4,This was my first time experiencing Lebanese food.  Oh. My. Goodness! It was delicious! We had the share platter (I think that's what it was called) and my friend taught me how to eat it.  Even the rice was cooked perfectly.  I'll definitely be back.
La Luna (Concession Street),1,"Friends purchased a gift certificate for me after my mother passed away.  When I attempted to use the certificates, the owner came out and told me the certificates were not signed and would not honour them.  I explained WHY I had received them and was shocked at the lack of sympathy demonstrated.  Confirmed with friends that the certificate was purchased at lunch time from a waitress in the establishment.  Definitely won‚Äôt be back to this location (as I understand it, all locations are owned independently)

Update:  While the food is simply amazing, the customer service at their Concession location could not possibly be worse!!!  I received a gift certificate from some friends for a family meal after the passing of my mother.  When I initially attempted to use the gift certificate, I was refused as somehow the gift certificates had not been signed.  The friends who purchased the gift certificate on my behalf had to return the restaurant to have the gift certificates signed.  I returned then to use my gift certificate and explained that I had been refused due to their error in not signing my certificates.  The waitress who had made the error was apparently the one I was speaking to.  Instead of an apology, she was incredibly rude saying, ‚ÄúI had thirteen tables that day‚Äù.  I understand it can get busy and honestly don‚Äôt fault the server.  The business itself had two separate occasions to offer an apology for their error and did not.  Instead, they were completely rude, even knowing the reason I had received the gift certificates.  I was completely disappointed in their lack of concern and complete disregard for their customers.  If you value good customer service in the least, steer clear!"
La Luna (Concession Street),5,"When I visit my folks in Hamilton, La Luna has often the restaurant of choice for a family meal, where everyone enjoys something on the menu, including the kids. Over the years, we've eaten in several times and also ordered take out. The food has consistently been good and the service, when we've eaten in, has been friendly and timely.

On our last visit for take out, they missed one of our meals. It was a pain to have to drive back to the restaurant, but they were great and gave us complimentary baklava to make up for the missed order.

If you're looking for Lebanese food, you should definitely consider this place."
Bombay Touch,4,"The food is great üòÅ  my new wife, her family and myself came for a nice dinner. We were seated quickly. The server is very nice. The food came rather quickly and everything was hot and fresh.

My only two suggestions are these:

The food comes quick, but the dishes build up and one quickly runs out of room for the next dishes. Please have someone come and take used dishes often.

The booths and tables move quite easily, it would be good to bolt them down or affix them to the floor, just to keep things from moving around.

I really liked it here, and I look forward to bringing my wife and family here again as we are close by. The food and servers were great, so I say 4.5 üôÇ"
Bombay Touch,5,"I was so pleasantly surprised by this gem. I never usually am a lentil fan but their creamy lentils was just amazing! Everything made fresh to order and the robot delivery was a fun extra. Chicken delicious, prices good and service fantastic!"
Bombay Touch,5,Food was very tasty. Ordered chicken Tikka and lamb karahi and a veg samosa. Had to wait 25-30 minutes for chicken tikka to be served but it was worth it.
Bombay Touch,5,Great environment and atmosphere with great music at the right volume.  We were welcomed warmly and served in an excellent fashion.  The menu had soo many options it was great and delicious.  Great taste and fresh.
Bombay Touch,5,"Restaurants with not such great ambiance have always proven themselves in taste and customer service. Chilly chicken was truly a dish which is gonna drag me back to your doors. We ordered Bhindi Masala, Malai Kofta and Dahi Puri. Everything was 10/10. And a whole 1 star in the rating won by the Robot Serving the food. Totally worth it!!"
Ajio Korean and Japanese Restaurant,5,"Been going here for 2 years now and they‚Äôve never disappointed me ever. The food is always so good and I get really good service from everyone.
Although, it is a small restaurant, I would totally try it out. You can also order online and it‚Äôs really affordable. Love this place!"
Ajio Korean and Japanese Restaurant,5,"Always enjoy coming here! I usually just get the veggie bento, and it's always very tasty with a good assortment of items. The price of the veggie bento is great and you always leave feeling full! We got a little side salad and congee, I am unsure if those come with it or if it is a starter for every guest, but it's perfect! The service is okay, we did come in a bit close to closing so we waited quite a while before being seated after the empty tables were cleaned. Still very grateful that we were still served!"
Ajio Korean and Japanese Restaurant,4,"Spicy Salmon Roll ($7.50): 7 / 10
Spicy Tuna Roll ($8.50): 7 / 10

Both rolls were tasty and large! There was lots of fresh fish on top as well as inside the roll, which really fills you up nicely. I really enjoyed the fact that it was actually hot (spicy). I would definitely be back to try more of the menu. Everything was fresh and the prices are very fair for the food quality and quantity. I'm sure the special rolls are excellent and will be trying some next time to update this review!"
Ajio Korean and Japanese Restaurant,5,Very simple and cute restaurant. The woman that helped us was very polite. The food came out HOT very fresh and great tasting food. Very much enjoyed our time here. Cards accepted and cash accepted with a 5% discount!
Ajio Korean and Japanese Restaurant,5,Been to Ajios multiple times and I love their cold noodles! So much flavour and I really like their salad and congee for the apps. The fried pancake was decent.
"GREENLEAF - South Indian Food, Idli, Dosa Restaurant In Hamilton",5,Better than Milan restaurant in flavour I love it worth coming from Niagara with my friends enjoy the food had a good time. Go for Dabeli it‚Äôs the best with faloda.the sweet lassi is the finisher after the meals do order that it‚Äôs the must
"GREENLEAF - South Indian Food, Idli, Dosa Restaurant In Hamilton",5,"I visited this place 2nd time today with few friends in Hamilton and will definitely visit regularly. We tried Dabeli, Vada Pav, Pav Bhaji, Dahi Puri, Manvhurian Dry, Dosa, Masala Chaas & Mango Lassi!
I have few pictures to share. But each and every dish tasted extremely good.
For Manchurian Dry- I would say it was very spicy but otherwise definitely Indian street style taste.
Customer service is also 10/10 we were received well and served with smile.
Food quality & taste definitely on point!

Will visit again soon!"
"GREENLEAF - South Indian Food, Idli, Dosa Restaurant In Hamilton",4,The food was good in terms of quality quantity and price.the place was ok enough to sit and eat.service was good too.
"GREENLEAF - South Indian Food, Idli, Dosa Restaurant In Hamilton",3,"We tried Mysore Masala Dosa, The Dosa was good but the chutneys weren't the greatest. Also the sambar tastes not as good as the 'South Indian Sambar'.

Service was good, the poor girl needs to attend the cash and serve and clean all the tables. She was the only one at the front !!!!!
One row of seating is so much squeezed and so hard to get seated. The Washroom are just 'okay'."
"GREENLEAF - South Indian Food, Idli, Dosa Restaurant In Hamilton",2,What a waste of money. We did take out and got very less quantity. We also ordered samosa which was half burnt and just had boiled potatoes with no spices. Never going there again. Terrible experience.
Indian Spice,4,"It is one of the restaurants having good indian style egg dishes. We tried Gotalo and was delicious. We also tried vadapav and veg grill sandwich. I visited retaurant after dinner like in India we used to go sometimes after dinner. Pretty good in quantity.

Vadapav 2/5 (The typical burger buns are not best suit for vadapav)

Sandwich 4.5/5

Gotalo 5/5"
Indian Spice,5,Fantastic food hands down. Tried this restaurant three times and happy to have same taste every time(not too many Indian restaurants have this consistency). Had egg dishes so far. Next time will try Dosa(heard good reviews). And lastly the owner is very humble and loves connecting to customers. Nice job guys.
Indian Spice,5,"My go to place for south Indian food.
Food is delicious, and i am the kind of guy who puts quality over everything, trust me when i say this, quality of food is outstanding at this place.
In terms of the price, you get the best bang for your buck.
Mittal was our server last time we went and she made our experience a positive one."
Indian Spice,1,"One of the worst experience visiting here with family members.

Need to wait for more than an hour between giving order and servings.

Instead of butter naan, kulcha was served as butter naan! .

The food items' taste and spiciness have been tailored as per Canadian white people. For example, their user base is completely Indians, still when it comes to very spicy food, it's not at all spicy!

Overall, not worthwhile visiting there! It's total waste of time and money."
Indian Spice,5,We stumbled across this restaurant in Hamilton. The taste of food was delicious. Vadapav and masala half fry was on of the dishes that we loved it. Pavbhaji could be more spicy side but apart of this everything was really good.
Lotus Thai & Vietnamese Cuisine,5,The food here was absolutely delicious. Great for ordering multiple dishes and sharing with a family or friends. The Waitresses were very nice. All the dishes were great however I would certainly recommend the Penang Curry. Will visit again next time we are in Hamilton
Lotus Thai & Vietnamese Cuisine,5,My daughter loves it here as do I. Friendly staff and fast to make your order. No complaints at all. üëçüèΩ
Lotus Thai & Vietnamese Cuisine,5,"Excellent service and delicious food! We got the crab Rangoon, and my boyfriend and I each got a bowl of pho. I wish they had tendon but it‚Äôs ok lol. The broth is extremely flavourful with a very clean mouthfeel. One of the best pho broths in town in my opinion. Their pandan tea is also a game changer! Can‚Äôt wait to come back!"
Lotus Thai & Vietnamese Cuisine,5,"One of my favorite places of all time. The staff are very polite, attentive and hard working. The restaurant is very clean and inviting and you really get that welcoming feel from the staff. The food quality and flavor profile are almost second to
none, especially for the price. I highly recommend the #211 Lotus Speacial Pho Sate which is this coconut curry spicy pho with beef and noodles. This dish really packs a flavorful punch that will straighten you out proper and send you home feeling better than ever. Give this fine restaurant a try, you won't be disappointed.  5/5‚òÜ"
Lotus Thai & Vietnamese Cuisine,5,A week after eating here and I'm still dreaming about the delicious food and amazing hospitality. Just picked this spot randomly off Google maps and it did not disappoint! Great portions and decent prices for delicious food. The spice level was just right
Saigon House Restaurant (Hamilton),4,"I was pretty happy with my Pho, and Rice dish. Vietnamese Coffee was great but it took an hour to prep when I finished my dishes by then. I noticed the Service has been kinda sub par since my last two visits but it was probably that one server breaking the experience.

The busser seemed more polite and accommodating than the Server himself. I had to walk up to pay because it took so long, which the busser was very great to deal with but then the Server guy comes back 10 mins later asking if I needed the bill. Also didn‚Äôt have water refills at all.

I‚Äôll still give this 4 stars overall to be fair but just keep in mind that one guy might break your Service experience."
Saigon House Restaurant (Hamilton),5,"Very flavorful and we'll seasoned! We enjoyed everything that we tried, I think the only downside was we came at a busy time so things weren't moving as quickly as we would have liked."
Saigon House Restaurant (Hamilton),5,"Our sauce container exploded minutes after sitting down. It was one of those things that occasionally happens, the heat of the dishwasher introduces micro-cracks and/or micro stresses in the glass that nobody would be able to see, and eventually it explodes.

We decided to go home and get cleaned up before returning. Without prompting they gave us one of our two meals for free, which I felt was fair (the sauce only got on one of us). Luckily it did not stain.

Other than the initial unfortunate event it was a great place and was an interesting experience."
Saigon House Restaurant (Hamilton),5,"Great food in a no frills setting. We did the ""all you can eat BBQ"" and found the meats and vegetables to be great quality with lots of options to try but also that the side dishes we very very good. Just don't expect industrial loft designer fancy environment. Strongly recommend!"
Saigon House Restaurant (Hamilton),4,"Food was pretty good overall, just nothing particularly stood out vs. Other pho I've had. The only thing I can really comment on about the food was that it is definitely spicier than what I've come to expect out of Satay dishes, but if you love spicy food it shouldn't be an issue. Service was good as well."
Sana Grill (Fennell Ave),1,I ordered their chicken rice from them through the app. And not only did it have like the smallest cup of sauce I've ever seen it also had none of the hot sauce I ordered. Don't uber from them or this is what you get I guess
Sana Grill (Fennell Ave),3,"This place has the best chicken and rice plate UNLESS the girl with the glasses is making it!  You will notice she barely even cooks the rice, doesn‚Äôt ask if you want hot sauce in the rice like every other employee does, also barely cooks the pitas so they are still very bready without the bite of truly warmed bread, every time I go in and she serves me I die on the inside because I‚Äôm forced to order and waste 15.50 on a chicken and rice plate which I can barely stomach (and usually throw out half) because the rice is barely warm and clumpy and downright gross.  It takes her 45 seconds to make, with the other employees they take at least three minutes and they actually agitate the rice in the pan to spread the heat.  Someone please tell her how to apply heat. It is her job and she is making me want to never go there again.  The other employees cook everything well which is why I keep going there.  Seriously, you have worked there for 2 years now, taste your own gross cooking and put some effort in.  Here I am refrying it in my own pan turning the white sauce into straight oil‚Ä¶ put some vinegar into the rice as well with your clear white bottle.  Keep your eye on her and you will know what I mean.  She doesn‚Äôt really know what she is doing.  Other than that, best chicke and rice in Hamilton, would have been 5 stars across the board if she had some more training.  It‚Äôs a shame"
Sana Grill (Fennell Ave),5,"The falafel and rice dish is amazing! And only $13 with tax.

It's the best with loads of white sauce and the regular amount of hot sauce.

It even comes with two warm, soft, fluffy, chewy pitas!"
Sana Grill (Fennell Ave),1,"Theres a young woman who works here who might be the most miserable woman I've ever met in my life, she seriously hates her job. She is always wearing headphones and consistently turns people away saying the store is closed when its not. There are many many complaints about her on here and to the owners, she is ruining your business!"
Sana Grill (Fennell Ave),5,"The wrap is smaller than i expected. However, they add lots of white sauce in it that makes every bit very flavourful. Definitely worth paying a visit. They can add the white sauce on top of the fries as well which is great. Place itself is not big so take out would be your best bet."
Royal Paan (Hamilton - Rymel),5,"Paan Shop Par Excellent

I recently had the pleasure of visiting an extraordinary paan shop, and I couldn't be more thrilled to share my exceptional experience. Nestled in the heart of the city, this paan shop is an absolute gem that deserves recognition for its outstanding service and delectable offerings.

From the moment I stepped inside, I was greeted by warm and friendly staff who were passionate about their craft. Their knowledge and expertise in creating exquisite paans were truly impressive. They patiently guided me through their extensive selection, explaining the ingredients and flavors of each paan with genuine enthusiasm.

The variety of paans available was mind-boggling. From traditional classics to innovative fusion creations, this shop had something to cater to every palate. Each paan was crafted with meticulous attention to detail, ensuring the perfect blend of flavors and textures. The freshness of the ingredients was evident, as every bite exploded with bursts of delightful taste.

Not only were the paans exceptional, but the presentation was also impeccable. They were elegantly wrapped in betel leaves, adorned with vibrant toppings and sprinkled with mouthwatering chutneys. It was a feast for the eyes even before I indulged in their delightful flavors.

Moreover, the shop maintained impeccable hygiene standards. The cleanliness of the preparation area and the use of fresh ingredients further enhanced my confidence in their offerings. They took special care to accommodate dietary preferences and offered sugar-free options for those with specific requirements.

What truly stood out was the personalized service I received. The staff went above and beyond to ensure that my paan experience was nothing short of extraordinary. They patiently answered all my queries, suggested unique combinations, and even customized paans according to my preferences. Their passion for creating a memorable experience was evident in every interaction.

Lastly, the prices were reasonable considering the quality and variety offered. The value for money was exceptional, making it accessible for all to indulge in this unique culinary delight.

Their outstanding service, wide range of flavors, impeccable hygiene, and personalized approach make it an absolute must-visit destination. Prepare to embark on a tantalizing journey for your taste buds and experience paans like never before. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!"
Royal Paan (Hamilton - Rymel),5,"This place is very good to enjoy Indian food. We have tried Garlic Masala Dosa, Panner Kathi Roll,  Dabeli, Bahubali Sandwich, Cheese Garlic Puff, Chocolate Shake and Ras Malai. The Panner Kathi Roll and Dosa were must try one. In sweet the Ras Malai was so much tasty. We have it order twice."
Royal Paan (Hamilton - Rymel),1,"In canada I visited most royal paan but I experience with this store like one of the worst royal paan in world as well staff and service. But don‚Äôt worry I can complain to health department as well food safety if your owner not take it any action and your franchise. Bad customer service.
If your washroom is not working you should fix it or close your restaurant... Everyone needs to wash their hands before they eat.? Will never come back.
This restaurant has two rest room and both of them are not working and my kids need to go washroom but they don‚Äôt have washroom working.."
Royal Paan (Hamilton - Rymel),1,"Disappointed to receive stale 'raj Kachori', falooda was ok, please improve"
Royal Paan (Hamilton - Rymel),5,The food is extremely delicious and the best part is there are so many varieties of dishes to choose from as well as the service is also great. I definitely recommend this place. Dine in and take out services are also great. Noodle burgers and Bombay grill sandwiches are awesome.
Lava Pizza & Wings,4,"Heard a lot about their Samosa poutine. Tried with high hope. Was impressed with the taste. Crushed vegetable samosa was the actual ingredient along with chopped onions, green peppers, tomatoes, green peas, cilantro and some white sauce on top to made the taste amazing. Medium size was good for 2 of us. 10/10 for the food.
4 star is just for their customer service."
Lava Pizza & Wings,3,"Reasonably priced, the food itself can be hit or miss, my most recent order wasn't without issue, the large chicken shawarma poutine was quite decent, good portion size. the small gyro pizza i ordered however... the strips of gyro meat were almost crispy and bland, like if i were blind and not knowing what kind of pizza it was i'd think the meat was some kind of flavourless freeze-dried bacon. plus the extra topping of roasted garlic i ordered was absent on the pizza but not on the bill. we all have off days, the restaurant/fast food industry isn't immune to that either."
Lava Pizza & Wings,2,"The breading on the large pizza I received was gross it was like a really bad unleavened flat bread. The sauce could have been better too.

Although to be fair I ordered a cheeseless pizza so maybe they don't have much experience with that."
Lava Pizza & Wings,1,"They burnt  the pizza and it was too cold to walk back and return it.

They made us wait for 20 min for what, for this pile of garbage

Unhygienic place

Dnt compromise on quality"
Lava Pizza & Wings,1,"Not only did I see a cockroach when I came into pickup an order I placed on the phone, I paid 25$ for a large pizza that was horrendous and gave me food poisoning. Attached is a photo of the cockroach, places like this shouldn‚Äôt be in business."
Industria Pizzeria + Bar (Stoney Creek),5,"This pizza joint is ok!

The staff are welcoming and we found a great seat in the lounge where the overall restaurant environment is well designed.

The food was average or slightly below.

I love grilled calimari but unfortunately this version disappointed.

Grilled squid should come out lightly seasoned but this dish was covered in sauce and the quality of calamari was poor.

The caesar salad passed and the pizza good.

It was a little sloppy for my liking and therefore the crust near the front of the pizza triangle was limp and lifeless.

The experience was good, but not good enough to return unfortunately.

As a  note to management, the plastic handled scissors to cut the pizza was a little sketch and left a negative impression with me."
Industria Pizzeria + Bar (Stoney Creek),2,"I wasn't impressed with the service at this location. The waitress gave my father-in-law the incorrect order, there weren't any refills offered, & she couldn't open the bottle of mineral water. My brother-in-law had to open it for her. I was also disappointed with the quality of the calamari & I work in the food industry. I hope they make improvements before I consider going back to that location and have a family meal. Thanks!"
Industria Pizzeria + Bar (Stoney Creek),5,"Was fantastic. First time here, and asked the waitress to give me recommendations. She did NOT disappoint! The pesto was amazing! Nice alcohol list, something for everyone. The donuts were a little greasy but SO good."
Industria Pizzeria + Bar (Stoney Creek),5,"Party of four on a Sunday night. We didn't have to wait long and were directed to a table. Our server was extremely friendly and brought us water and cutlery right away. We ordered the Grilled Calamari, Fries, Pepperoni E Formaggio Pizza, Spaghetti E Polpette, and Spaghetti Ai Frutti Di Mare. The Grilled Calamari was really good, soft and tender. Didn't take a picture of the calamari since we just dived into it as soon as it hit the table. The rest of our food arrived and portion size was good. The food tasted simple and fresh. The atmosphere was a bit loud for my liking. However, with sports playing on most tv screens, it's expected to be louder. The service was friendly, attentive, and overall great. I would definitely recommend Industria Pizzeria & Bar."
Industria Pizzeria + Bar (Stoney Creek),1,"Got a pizza for takeout, which I ordered over phone, instructed for it to be pre cut, and specially asked if they had their $15 pizza deal after 8:30pm which the person confirmed with me.

Fast forward I instead had to pay the full price which is $7 more, and when I asked the manager why I was paying full price she told me take out does not get the special price, so dining in is cheaper then take out!!??? I have never seen that before. I also told the manager they confirmed the $15 sale price over the phone and all she said was she will let the staff know??? Not sure what that means, but the service was horrible overall. To top it off the pizza was horribly cut and I literally had to tear it with my hands as you can see in the right side of the photo. Horrible experience overall."
Dim Sum House,5,"Great, authentic yumcha with a few fusion items. The Yew Chow dumplings were a bit overcooked so would fall apart when trying to take them out of the steam basket but it was all delicious."
Dim Sum House,4,"We are so delighted to have recently discovered/tried this restaurant. Within the past two weeks, we have already gone three times due to our family's enjoyment of it. Within Hamilton, we would argue this is one of the better traditional dim sum restaurants we have been thrilled to eat at, although we acknowledge it is still a reach to compare it to authentic dim sum restaurants out in the GTA. Their food prices are fair and we justify it based on the fact we are saving on the cost of gas to go out-of-city for the premium.

Portion sizes are reasonable to the price, though there are some items that are certainly bang-for-the-buck. The congee is spectacular for Hamilton quality, we have not experienced anything like this within the city confines and we're sure to order it on every visit.

As usual, downtown parking is never thrilling, but there is availability in rear lots and curbside (if you're lucky), but most of it will be paid unless you are willing to do a bit of a hike or it's a weekend/holiday.

The staff there are attentive and friendly. With years of exposure to the level of service at Asian restaurants/eateries, I can say their service puts a smile on my face. The atmosphere is inviting and the only area I would say is a bit lacking, would be their washrooms, they're a bit dingy and is located downstairs (would be a problem for those with accessibility needs). This place accepts cash and card (without a surcharge), which is nice.

I did notice some promotional offers on their tables, one with a 10% discount offer and when I inquired about how to obtain it, I was not given a very clear answer and left confused. I had to do some digging on my own and my response to that would be if there are promotions available on the table, then the staff should be aware of how to explain the promotion terms/conditions."
Dim Sum House,4,"A nice spot for dim sum. Ambience is quite nice and clean. They have a great selection of dishes to choose from, and you order from an iPad. Dim sum dishes are generally well done. The rice and congee dishes are quite a substantial size as well. Would recommend the sticky rice."
Dim Sum House,5,"Always a great experience & yummy authentic dim sum!! I grew up having dim sum almost every weekend but when we moved to Hamilton, options were very limited. I was super happy when I saw there was a second Dim Sum restaurant opening and I‚Äôm so glad I gave it a shoot! It‚Äôs become my go to whenever I‚Äôm craving! If you don‚Äôt want to leave the city, this is the place to go!"
Dim Sum House,4,Was really nice place. have good dimsum and easy to order from I pad .. service was great ..will definitely will be our regular place to go
The Burnt Tongue (Locke),5,Bangkok fries were delicious! Nice and crispy  fries and tasty sauce. Soup was piping hot and delicious. Will definitely come back whenever I'm craving soup.
The Burnt Tongue (Locke),1,"Cash was rude, food took forever, one burger came up then our other order took another 10 mins (burger and fries) altogether took way too long. When I asked how long it would be I just was told ""It's coming"" ..very rude ...never goin here again. used to be way better. Also, my burger was undercooked. Checked it when I got home bc I only ate my fries at the restaurant."
The Burnt Tongue (Locke),4,"More places need to exist like the Burnt Tongue.  Hearty sandwiches and soups with veg options that don't taste like it comes from a can or some warehouse? YES PLEASE!

Service here is quick casual and it comes fast.  Fries are crisp and doused in sauce if you order beyond the regular fries.  Sandwiches are healthily stuffed and flavourful.  Soup is seasoned well and love the veg options.  I wish they had more options that had more green veg or veg stock.  Either way, I'd come back because it was affordable and tasted great."
The Burnt Tongue (Locke),1,If took a long time to get the 2 burgers. One burger came after 15 minutes. And the other one after the first person had finished eating theirs. Staff were not friendly and were annoyed when we inquired how long it would be for the second  burger. Unacceptable service! The second burger was undercooked and pinkish in the center. That's a health risk. This restaurant used to be excellent but not anymore. Won't be returning ever again. So disappointed.
The Burnt Tongue (Locke),5,"Great spot for lunch on a chilly day. tried their tomato soup, which was the best I‚Äôve ever tried, the grilled cheese was bigger than expected for the price and the fries are great, not too crispy but not too soggy. The atmosphere is nice, it‚Äôs a pickup counter with tables to sit at. Overall it was a great meal with fair prices, I would love to try their full menu of soups eventually."
Fishing Sushi,3,"As a treat we tried this new to us sushi restaurant after watching a YouTube video.  We had never heard of this restaurant on concession.  It‚Äôs take out only and if you have cash 10% off.  After review of a giant menu, we decided on dim sum, maki sampler (18) and a special maki.  Our favourite was the special maki.  Warm and fresh.  Good prices.  I would have liked to try more special makis versus the generic sampler we choose (California rolls and such).  Pass on the dim sum and stick to their specialities. Next time."
Fishing Sushi,5,"What can i say, i eat a lot of sushi. and i can say with certainty that fishing sushi is the best sushi i have ever had.
the tuna and salmon are so fresh and delicious and melt in your mouth good.
the food is always ready so quick and you can‚Äôt beat the price for the quality of food they serve. the dim sum is also spectacular and i continue to be a customer to this place on a weekly basis.
(i would add a picture but i always gobble the food way too quickly before getting a photo
AMAZING"
Fishing Sushi,5,"Good sushi, fairly priced and quick service. Staffs are nice, professional and attentive. Will come back. I also took my family and friends. Overall, very satisfied"
Fishing Sushi,2,"Wanted to give a different sushi joint a chance. Not a fan at all. All the nigiri were tiny half bites and maki were underwhelming. Better off buying at Fortinos. The shrimp is a bit weird, why is it still translucent? (looks uncooked and questionable)"
Fishing Sushi,5,"One of my go to place for sushi in Hamilton!  They have a variety of party trays. The rolls are a large size, great tasting and fresh! Prices are decent but well worth it. I was obsessed  and could eat this everyday."
McDonald's (Kingston - 312 Princess),5,The place layout is nice but it feels a little crowded. The staff are great though. They are very friendly and professional.
McDonald's (Kingston - 312 Princess),1,"Horrible experience with staff they judges and pointed at me, the whole time I was trying to eat because I have a service dog. Awful. Staff not trained towards disabilities"
McDonald's (Kingston - 312 Princess),5,Atmosphere ok-ish! Food was good though!
McDonald's (Kingston - 312 Princess),1,Worst behavior by the servers....making fun of customers...didn't know I do understand their language....Please do train them customer service prior to putting them in front
McDonald's (Kingston - 312 Princess),2,Closed at 4am despite being 24 hour?! Normally a normal McDonalds tho.
For Thirst and Hunger Beverage and Food Company,4,"Amazing little restaurant, working on adding a bar section, spectrum friendly and able to use more stimulant friendly area. Frozen take out dinners for single or family. Consignment items for sale. Food is delicious and the owners are super friendly!"
For Thirst and Hunger Beverage and Food Company,2,"Was very disappointed in the breakfast. Hash browns were hardly cooked and the breakfast was cold. They have no decaf coffee when that is all I am able to drink. I will not be returning to this restaurant and suggest others to do the same.
My partner found that the food was tasteless."
For Thirst and Hunger Beverage and Food Company,3,"it was alright. potatoes not crispy or seasoned, stale ketchup. sticky table (think it has been painted with wall paint) nice enough staff though."
For Thirst and Hunger Beverage and Food Company,5,The food and staff are a 10/10. Both of my experiences have been fantastic. I want to eat here everyday
For Thirst and Hunger Beverage and Food Company,5,"The owners are the absolute friendliest people!
Loved the unique sandwich menu.
The food was delicious and a huge hit with our staff.
Highly recommend!"
A&W (328 King St),5,"Honestly hands down the best breakfast I have ever had! Everything is made to perfection and the staff at this location are always so welcoming and accommodating! My favourite location by far!! Also, A&W truly has the best hash browns by far!! Way better than McDonald‚Äôs and Tim Hortons! Do yourself a favour and go order the all Canadian breakfast from them!!"
A&W (328 King St),5,"Best customer service in town I've ever experienced in a fast food restaurant...
I thought I ordered fries... But I could have ordered onion rings by accident... They gave me my fries and never questioned it.
Just made it right... Thank you."
A&W (328 King St),5,"If you go too often the staff will remember your order...""teen combo with fries and rootbeer for here"".

But really, the AC is always cranked, the staff are timely and kind, and it has a nice atmosphere."
A&W (328 King St),1,"Ridiculous service !!!! Super slow, tables were dirty. Anjali who was taking the order was so slow, tables were dirty and when I spoke to her and a male cook ( Indian guy with must-ache) said ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt help it, the manager is not answering the call and you talk to him‚Äù. He kept on throwing his manager under the bus. He said ‚Äúwe all are trainees and we can‚Äôt help it. Manager doesn‚Äôt do anything ! ‚Äú
I am shocked by the carelessness and the lack of customer service at this store.
To top it all Anjali started arguing with me saying I was rude to that guy and that ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt help anything. Manager is not helping. ‚Äú
I told her is that you guys represent A& W and you can‚Äôt say ‚Äútalk to the manager ‚Äú. No apology. No empathy nothing.
Huge line up. Dirty tables. Very bad place.
Manager/ owners - pls hire more people and train them well. They need to know how to handle an irate customer and not pass the buck to you all !!!
Very sad ! They can‚Äôt say ‚Äú we are just the workers and talk to the manager ‚Äú !!!
I specifically asked Anjali if chicken BLT has any other meat, (since I was not sure ) than chicken and she said ‚Äúonly chicken‚Äù and now I have the burger with bacon in it and I don‚Äôt eat bacon !!"
A&W (328 King St),5,Friendly service and a fresh breakfast for a reasonable price plus a giant cup of coffee.
Tommy's,5,"Had a friends lunch and all 15 of us got to sit at the same spot; tables next to each other. That was amazing:-). We all enjoyed our meals including the kids. Both the kids and adults menus have some good variety options. I went for the Cobb salad. Everything  tasted so good.
The  taste was well worth the wait for the meals. This also just gave us the extra reassurance that all meals are freshly prepared fresh :-). The portion sizes Vs the price are excellent value for money. I even ended up taking some of the salad home since it was too much for one sitting.

Loved that they provided kids with a kids toy bin and so they were engaged while we waited for the food."
Tommy's,5,"The food was excellent as always! The service is phenomenal! Your water/coffee/beverages are always filled right to the brim and your food always comes within 20 minutes. You usually are seated wherever you want when it‚Äôs not busy. Dan and Zach were super nice to me and so was Leslie, one of the floor managers. Would definitely recommend if you‚Äôre on a budget as a student, or just passing through the downtown region of Kingston, Ontario"
Tommy's,5,I LOVE that pancakes is an option as a breakfast side! I ordered eggs benedict (I asked to have my hollandaise sauce on the side) and pancakes (with blueberries added) as my side and was able to enjoy a sweet and savory breakfast. The milkshakes are also quite delicious!
Tommy's,1,"Arrived on a Wednesday at 5pm. It wasn't busy. Service was extremely slow and after they dropped off the food, not one visit to ask how the food was or to refill our beverages. I ordered the Stinky Burger and it was a mistake. It was very dry. Burger seemed like it was forgotten on the grill and was spiced with too much Montreal steak spice or something. It was like a hockey puck. Definitely a waste of time and money. I have to start realizing that downtown restaurants in Kingston, ON are not going to be of good quality. Lots of students here means you don't have to have tasty food because students are just looking for a place to drink and snack. Very disappointed."
Tommy's,5,"Service was great.
I didn't want to come here but I'm glad I did.
Deep fried pickles with sour cream and chipotle sauces. Yummy best I've tried.
Classic burger and fries were done right. The stink burger my girlfriend had was great as well. The caeser salad needs a bit of lemon to round it out. Finished with fried cheesecake it was good also. This is definitely a place I will come back to."

Subway (Ontario Street),5,"friendly staff, efficient and fast service and fresh ingredients each time i go. place is clean and it is always a good experience for grabbing a quick, fresh and inexpensive bite"
Subway (Ontario Street),1,"there was this girl Ayushi taking our order, she was so rude and her attitude was not acceptable. You better make customer‚Äôs day with smile not ruin it!"
Subway (Ontario Street),1,"Tables were dirty , staff member had family visit  but when it was no customers ordering the eating area was overlooked"
Subway (Ontario Street),1,Ordered a sub today clearly put in the notes to be toasted extra long as I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to eat it until my break and didn‚Äôt want the bread to be soggy. It wasn‚Äôt even toasted. I called to complain and they argued with me that the cheese was melted so it was toasted.
Subway (Ontario Street),1,My rice bowl's rice tasted rotten and sandwiches don't have any sauce in the first 3 inches...... will not visit this location again...
Wendy's (1043 Princess St.),1,"The weekday morning order taker and is a rude, ill-tempered individual. There‚Äôs too many fast food joints to be turning off customers!"
Wendy's (1043 Princess St.),4,"Service was quick and friendly. Ordered a Baconator combo with large fries and a large drink, and my order was ready almost as soon as I finished filling my cup at the soda fountain. I ordered to go, but there is a large spacious, fairly well lit dining area you can sit at if you order dine in. Location is easy enough to access from Princess Street and has plenty of parking available. I'd recommend here if you are looking for a quick bite to eat while running errands nearby"
Wendy's (1043 Princess St.),1,"Store hours are incorrect, they do not close at 10, they close at 9 at the very least. Hopefully the franchise owner can update the listing.

Employee wouldn‚Äôt let me in to order, at 9:30, asked if I could walk through the drive through to order and was told yes. Some guy with heavy facial acne stood there and laughed at me but didn‚Äôt serve me."
Wendy's (1043 Princess St.),1,worst wendy‚Äôs I have been to. They‚Äôre super rude and make your order wrong! All their milkshakes and other drinks are only half filled!! Save yourself the money and don‚Äôt go here
Wendy's (1043 Princess St.),4,Great food. Better than Peterborough ontario Wendy.  Food actually tastes good.
Geneva Crepe Bistro,5,Went twice in three days because I love the menu selections and the food quality. There were 7 of us and we all enjoyed our meals.  There is something for everyone. Great selection of drinks also including the London Fog which I am told was perfection.   I had the Royal Thai with buckwheat crepe both times and loved it. Dessert crepes were just irresistible. If I were living in Kingston this would be my go to cr√™perie.  Service great also. Note this is not fast food and quality takes slightly longer although we went at a quiet time so did not need to wait.
Geneva Crepe Bistro,3,The food and drinks were amazing. The service however was very poor. Staff came off as rude and hard to flag down. Was seated for a little over 22 minutes before our order was taken. The person seated next to us who came in 10 minutes after us had there order taken after only 5 minutes. Tried to flag down the server and had them completely ignore me eventually saying ‚Äújust 2 minutes‚Äù as they walked by. Server also seemed to be rushing everything they did even to the point of yanking the menu out of my hand before I was done speaking.
Geneva Crepe Bistro,5,"When you walk in you might be put off because the place has some stuff here and there but do NOT let that deter you. The food was absolutely delicious, the flavors were AMAZING!! I had the signature savoy crepe and you won't be disappointed at all. Easily one of the best things I have ever eaten in my entire life."
Geneva Crepe Bistro,4,"Really good crepe place, amazing flavors. They are short of staff so food will take its time but it‚Äôs worth wait. This was the Brownie one split between two people. This was one second round, first we had the versaille and the maple breakfast one both were excellent"
Geneva Crepe Bistro,4,"The sweet crapes we ordered were ok, although the dolce delache was apparently caramel syrup and my daughter couldn‚Äôt eat it.  I ordered build your own crape with stake and caramelised onions and got 4 small pieces of meat and raw onions."
Panera Bread (88 Dalton Avenue),5,"I recently visited Panera Bread in Kinston and had a wonderful experience. The staff went above and beyond to make sure that my meal was perfect. I ordered half a veggie sandwich, but by mistake, they brought a normal sandwich. However, when I informed them of the mistake, they immediately and politely made me a new sandwich.

To make up for the mistake, they even offered me a full sandwich, which was incredibly generous. They served my food to my table, despite it being a self-service restaurant, which was a nice touch. The staff was friendly, and the service was prompt and efficient.

The sandwich itself was delicious, and I particularly enjoyed the Ten Vegetable soup. It was flavourful, healthy, and the perfect complement to my meal. The coffee was also fantastic and a great way to end my meal.

The ambiance of the restaurant was beautiful, with warm lighting and comfortable seating. The restaurant was clean and well-maintained, making for a comfortable dining experience.

Overall, I highly recommend Panera Bread in Kinston. The staff, food, and ambiance were all exceptional. I give it a 5-star rating and will definitely be returning in the future."
Panera Bread (88 Dalton Avenue),5,First time eating here and it was really good. Average price. I especially liked how they give you a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready so you arent waiting in a huge pick up line.
Panera Bread (88 Dalton Avenue),3,"Been visiting since it first opened - it has really gone down hill over the years. Great location next to the Tesla Super Charger + good service and always a smile. Just the food is meh quality and keeps getting worse.

P.S. Please at least cut the damn sandwich so I don't have too with a flimsy plastic knife."
Panera Bread (88 Dalton Avenue),3,"I was a bit disappointed at my last visit March 2, 2023.  Service was slow (although it was lunch time). I ordered the Pick-2 with the Smoky Buffalo Chx Melt and Asian Sesame Salad.  The salad was fine but the sandwich was a lot of sauce with very little filling.  My wife ordered 1/2 Med Veggie Sandwich and one French baguette with salad (her order was good but the baguette was missing which was OK in the end since she was full anyway). The bread is always excellent, staff are friendly.  But, for $42.78 for my wife and I (no beverages) it's a bit pricey for a mediocre sandwich."
Panera Bread (88 Dalton Avenue),3,"This is the second Panera I have ever been to.  Sadly, this location was well understaffed.
It took 20 mins to get a coffee made.  Then almost another 30 mins to get a take out lunch made.  One item was a Mediterranean bowl (delicous with a baguette), the other was a Mediterranean Sandwich and an apple.  I would not be writing this review if it was not for the fact, that after 3 hour drive away, pulled over for lunch....and no $15 sandwich.  üò†
There was lots of confusion with the customer before.  Hope this was just a ""bad day"" for staffing."
Denny's Canada (670 Gardiners Rd),5,"It was absolutely delicious. My mom decided to bring me here since this is my first time‚Ä¶ absolutely amazing. The wait was a little long, but there was one cook so I get it. But the wait was very much worth it‚Ä¶ I definitely plan to make this a normal stop every time I visit Kingston"
Denny's Canada (670 Gardiners Rd),5,"As a former resident of this city many years ago, visiting this particular Denny's as part of my bachelorette visit was a trip down memory lane.

To my delight, my bridesmaids had never been to a Denny's before, and they were pleasantly surprised by the experience. The restaurant has maintained its charm. The fast service, incredible food, and friendly staff all contributed to creating a truly memorable visit.

From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm smiles and a welcoming atmosphere. The staff at this Denny's went above and beyond to ensure our visit was enjoyable. They promptly seated us and provided excellent service throughout our meal, making us feel like valued guests.

Speaking of the food, it was absolutely delicious! The menu offered a wide range of options to suit everyone's tastes, from classic breakfast dishes to mouthwatering burgers and decadent desserts. The quality of the food was top-notch, and it exceeded our expectations.

Revisiting the Denny's on Gardiners Rd brought back a flood of happy memories for me, and I'm grateful to have shared this experience with my bridesmaids."
Denny's Canada (670 Gardiners Rd),5,"The entire team at this Denny's were amazing. My partner and I went for Valentine's Day, and even though they were understaffed, Chayse and the rest of the team were all so incredibly sweet. The food was delicious and quick to come out despite how busy the kitchen was! I've worked in food service before and I understand how hard it is to run understaffed, so I am very very pleased with the service we got. Please pass along my thanks to the team!!!
The banana caramel pancakes were exceptional, I highly recommend trying those if you can.
Great work everyone!!"
Denny's Canada (670 Gardiners Rd),5,"I had an exceptional customer service experience recently and would like to share my positive feedback. Niko the server was incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and attentive. They went above and beyond to address my concerns and ensure my satisfaction. Their friendly and professional demeanor made the entire experience pleasant and stress-free. I truly appreciate the outstanding service provided and would highly recommend their assistance to others."
Denny's Canada (670 Gardiners Rd),5,"I‚Äôd like to compliment our Server, Jinsey (I hope I‚Äôm spelling that right from memory). She made our experience a five star one. She was friendly, attentive and helpful and had a lovely welcoming smile. In fact, I would definitely recommend her for a raise! As for the food, we all had different things which aren‚Äôt mentioned below. I had the pancakes only and they were good. My mum had an egg sandwich I think with French fries. The fries are delicious. Amazing. She liked her sandwich. My husband had a double burger with onion rings and he loved it. We also had coffee and it was delicious. I would say we spent between $15-$25 each."
Peter's Place Restaurant,5,"Simple home-style breakfast. We shared the traditional breakfast and the turkey club. Both were good and came out quickly. The staff was very nice. Price was fair, we would come back."
Peter's Place Restaurant,5,"Really nice place, And the food is so good üòä"
Peter's Place Restaurant,5,This used to be a little hole-in-the-wall plave but they have expanded. Food was excellent and service was great!
Peter's Place Restaurant,5,"Eggs Benny was crazy good. Also cheaper than most breakfast/ brunch places in Kingston. My hubby had the BLT w fries and loved the sandwhich but the side of fries was a v large and slightly expensive portion so we had to take some home, which is fine. Nice staff and pretty clean, will likely come again!"
Peter's Place Restaurant,5,"Top notch! If you are looking for that morning-breakfast-diner-vibe, then come here. Great food, great prices, great environment!"
Coco Frutti (Kingston),4,Got a table quickly after arriving on Saturday around noon. Eileen was very hard-working and sweet! The food was classic breakfast food (the home fries were great!) and there is plenty to choose from on the menu. The lattes were also yummy!
Coco Frutti (Kingston),5,"went in with my girlfriend, it did take a little  time to get a table but we did go during a busy time the fruits, potatoes,eggs,crepes, sausages,bacon were all very delicious and filling. waitress were very nice and quick and the coffee was just right"
Coco Frutti (Kingston),4,"We decided to take my daughter to her favorite place for birthday brunch.  We were treated like family as soon as we entered the restaurant. We  were given our choice of seating.  Our server was so sweet and kind. She was timely and so patient with all of our extraness lol. She happily made several trips back to us to make sure that our meal was perfect.  The dining room was not super busy, but  our server was the only one waiting on tables. Although when our food was ready, the manager/owner delivered the first portion of our order as soon as it was up. We were delighted with the quality of our meals and were very pleased with our whole experience.  The cherry on top of our meal was when our server surprised my daughter with a yummy fudge brownie dessert and she sang happy birthday to her all by herself! She was so sweet and my daughter loved her birthday surprise.  It was so great and it made her entire day!"
Coco Frutti (Kingston),5,"Excellent brunch spot! Don't let the Sunday brunch line scare you, it moves very quickly. Lots of sweet and salty options, vegetarian options, good portions and delicious food. Sherry was fantastic and decor on point. 10/10 would recommend"
Coco Frutti (Kingston),5,Love this place for breakfast! Tried their croque moinseur and crepes. Nice ambience as well.
Gina's Grill,5,Always beyond happy with the food and service at Gina's grill. Such a great bang for your buck. Tons of food and it is so GOOD! All this food is 2 meals. You won't be disappointed if you try this restaurant!
Gina's Grill,5,"What a great diner!  After the change from the old 'star diner', I was unsure if Gina's would stand up.... And it certainly does!  Food is delicious and to your table in no time.  The staff are super friendly and always there to fill up your coffee. Now, I noticed the prices are up a little... But that is very understandable in light of everything is costing more today!  Highly recommend Gina's if you are wanting a more classic 'greasy spoon' experience."
Gina's Grill,5,"Wow! Yet another fantastic meal at Gina's! The food is delicious, the staff so friendly and accommodating! It feels like a home cooked meal with family. I have Celiac disease and this is one of my go to places to eat dinner in Kingston. Thank you Gina and staff! You still make the best greek food!!"
Gina's Grill,4,My wife and i went to Gina's Grill for Breakfast. We get in get greeted sat down waited about 10 minutes to get served. Two more customers came in and got served as they sat down with coffee and the waitress took their order before taking out order or even offer a drink order. Not to good customer service in my opinion. Not even say sorry for taking to long to serve us. In my opinion the food was luke warm and nothing to write a good review and the coffee was burnt tasting and the service was not the greatest. I usually give places a 2md chance but not this one. Thumbs downüëéand 2 star at best.
Gina's Grill,4,"A real locals spot! Our server was excellent, the food was pretty good although our pancake was a little underdone. Other than that it's a great bang for your buck, the bacon was perfect. We'll be back I'm sure!"
COBS Bread (RioCan Centre Kingston),5,"This is the best location I've ever gone to. The products are consistently fresh and delicious!

If I could give 10 star review with regards to the staff, I would. Each of them are so friendly and hard working. I have to shout out to Jack. Simply the best. Whomever hired Jack,  you hired a star.

I always feel so welcome here!"
COBS Bread (RioCan Centre Kingston),3,"I was hoping for more. Small selection.
Scones aren't traditional, very sweet. Danish are bland, cinnamon buns were very good. All three were quite pricey."
COBS Bread (RioCan Centre Kingston),5,"There isn't anything I wouldn't recommend, that's how bad this place is!! It becomes a good addiction ü§£ü§£ü§£"
COBS Bread (RioCan Centre Kingston),5,Every-time I go in I have a pleasant experience. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful and the food is delicious. The pumpkin scone and cinnamon buns are the best!
COBS Bread (RioCan Centre Kingston),5,"This was our first visit to this fabulous bakery and will not be our last. The service was second to none. J.J made sure we got exactly what we needed and gave us many samples to help us make our choices. We chose white bread rolls and a few danish this time but after tasting the sunflower sour dough bread sample, that‚Äôs on my list for next time as well as some hot cross buns."
Tim Horton's (945 Gardiners Rd-Cataraqui Twn Cntr),5,"Only two staff members working in the front, a bit of a lineup, but the two ladies did very well, with smiles on them the entire time. Both my beverages came out fresh and hot."
Tim Horton's (945 Gardiners Rd-Cataraqui Twn Cntr),1,"Nothing Pleasant about this tim hortons. The coffee was horrendous, the service was probably the slowest service I've ever experienced going to a tim hortons. It took 15minutes for them to make a breakfast wrap with only 4 people in front of me. I would strongly not recommend going to this tim hortons especially if you are in a crunch for time. That service should never be that slow especially being near a main bus transfer route. Need to hire people that actually want to work and not people who just drag their feet. They are not organized at all and was rude when I asked about my food. Last time going here. It was so bad I watched customers just walk out not even grabbing their food because they didn't want to wait any longer"
Tim Horton's (945 Gardiners Rd-Cataraqui Twn Cntr),1,"Service here is disappointing everytime I go and today was no exception.  There were very few people in line but the cashier still felt the need to rush through my order of one coffee and brought up the payment on the debit terminal before I could say anything or get the app open to scan. I tried to scan the app on my own before making payment and the scan beeped so I assumed it had worked and then tapped my payment card.  I did not receive any reward points or a roll up the rim credit. I returned to the same cashier and explained the situation. He sheepishly looked down at the point of sale terminal screen and pretended to ""investigate"". He then said ""There's nothing we can do"" so I asked if it was my fault or his? He then changed his story and said ""the points and roll should show up later"",  needless to say they did not.  Overall a small inconvenience in the grand scheme of things but the lack of decent customer service and lying to my face is what's most frustrating besides not getting reward points or a roll."
Tim Horton's (945 Gardiners Rd-Cataraqui Twn Cntr),5,Five star because the staff are very nice and they professionally handled and de-escalated a woman that was harassing them and trying to cause a scene. All because the washrooms are temporally/permanently closed. She could‚Äôve just used the Cataraqui Centre‚Äôs washrooms.
Tim Horton's (945 Gardiners Rd-Cataraqui Twn Cntr),3,"The service was fast and it was overall an okay experience but once again there is little to no cream cheese on my bagel, if i have to pay an extra $1 for cream cheese there should be enough to cover the bagel, not good!"
Quik Chek Convenience Store,4,"Only negative thing I can say is that lid on my takeout container wasn‚Äôt secured properly so it was a bit messy when I got home. Despite the mess, the food was tasty!

I am not sure of the name of the dish I ordered, staff recommended. It contained samosa, lots of chickpeas, cilantro, diced onion & tomatoes, and nice amount of heat!"
Quik Chek Convenience Store,3,"Had falooda, pan and thali today at Imperial Pan. Nice to have a place like this in Kingston , the falooda and thali was average found the falooda expensive the thali was well priced. Nice to have freshly made rotis. Lots of options will go back to try some other snacks.

Went again and had pani puri and chutney puri they were sooo good."
Quik Chek Convenience Store,5,"Tried their thali, samosa and gulab jamun. For the price you pay, this food is fantastic. Looking forward to trying more of their dishes!"
Quik Chek Convenience Store,5,"This place has been my number one for a while now. Their food is good, but what‚Äôs more surprising is their service. Their staff is really what has me coming back, especially the girl in the front, Kaushar. I haven‚Äôt seen her in a while, but she is really sweet and makes sure everything goes out perfectly even during busy times. Keep up the good work. Cheers!!"
Quik Chek Convenience Store,3,"A bit pricey for street food. Taste wise, it's average, nothing mind blowing to write about. For the extra butter fans, you will enjoy it. Not much better options in Kingston so this place will suffice for now"
35326 Petro-Canada (1586 Centennial Drive),5,Nice lady serving at the cash. She Was joyful and seemed happy to be there. Acknowledged me even if she was busy with another customer. Food was hot and freshly made. Place was very clean and inviting. Wasn't actually going to get anything... But they did get to me!!!
35326 Petro-Canada (1586 Centennial Drive),3,"I'm a fan of supporting the grass fed beef market.  For fast food, A&W has become a family favorite. It isn't economy fast food, but we feel the quality is worthy it.  However, after we just spent $54 on a family of 4 I had to run back inside for extra BBQ sauce. I was a little disappointed to have to make a $0.63 purchase through my debut card for the two packets of sauce.  Upon getting back on the road we discovered that the Papa burger paid for was a Momma burger."
35326 Petro-Canada (1586 Centennial Drive),1,"Worst A&w ever, got an egger breakfast sandwich with ketchup there was 3 times the butter than ketchup on my egger. Also got an early grey tea which was only filled half of the size of the cup. We pay a leg and a arm to buy your food and it the worse quality that you guys serve. Work on it instead of upsurging your prices and ripping off people"
35326 Petro-Canada (1586 Centennial Drive),5,"Excellent customer service, fresh food and very courteous staff. If you‚Äôre around the area this is a nice place to stop! We were serviced by Vincy on July 3 afternoon and she was very helpful and patient with my elderly parents. Thank you."
35326 Petro-Canada (1586 Centennial Drive),1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICE. Definitely watch how much you're charged for meals because one A$$#0|¬¢ will make sure you pay for it all seperate. I'm thinking he may be pocketing the difference ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§îüò†
Crossroads Country Store,5,"We came to a crossroads and had to choose‚Ä¶ Pizza or Indian food? And decided to do both.

We have passed this place a hundred times and chalked it up to binging a typical so/so small town pizza shop, but after some friends recommended it, me makes the drive, and will be making it again.

Their pizza crust is great, heavily cheesed with the right amount of toppings. The sauce is on the sweeter side but not crazy sweet.

I‚Äôm a die hard Biryani fan and Kingston is loaded with fake watered down (Canadianized) Biryani, this is one of only 2-3 places that I will actually order it.

The young guy working the counter was super friendly and polite. Very helpful.

Prices are a bit high, but worth it.

#Pizza #HiddenGem #ChickenBiryani #Biryani #Indianfood"
Crossroads Country Store,5,"Wow! That was so fresh and made with care! You can tell the dough is not frozen but made fresh . The perfect amount of toppings, and the pepperoni is huge ! So good !!  The crust !! Stone baked !  Yummmmm delivers way out on Rutledge ! Crossyroads!!!"
Crossroads Country Store,5,"One of the best pizza‚Äôs I‚Äôve had in years. Meat lovers was exceptional, will definitely be back"
Crossroads Country Store,5,"Oh my goodness. This place is an amazing hidden gem for Indian food!

Tonight we ordered the Chicken Biryani, the Butter Chicken Masala and the Paneer Tikka Masala and two Garlic Naan. The Paneer was sold out but they offered an alternative called Chicken Kurma (not yet on the menu). We said heck yes to the substitute and oh my goodness!!

Literally every single thing was phenomenal! Amazing job you guys - consider us new regulars!"
Crossroads Country Store,5,I ordered 6 samosas and she kindly offered to make them fresh.  Samosas are very delicious and have a great flavour to them. It's nice to have vegetarian options as well.  Very friendly and helpful staff. Would definitely recommend.
East Side Mario's (Kingston),5,Just wanted to give a big shout out to Madison the hostest. We went to this location Friday July 21 @615pm. It was extremely busy and we had a weird request for a table for 5 plus a highchair. She was so sweet and was trying her best to get us a table as soon as she could and kept us updated on the situation.  I felt so sorry for her as she was getting pulled in every direction and just wanted to praise her for keeping calm and getting through it! We also enjoyed our food!
East Side Mario's (Kingston),4,"Years ago, we vowed we would not be back because the service was so poor.  After today's visit, we will definitely be back.  Good food, great service, relaxed and pleasant atmosphere.  You have been reinstated on our 'date night' spots list."
East Side Mario's (Kingston),5,"Our large family recently had dinner at this location and had a fantastic experience with our server Kasey. While restaurant was very busy, Kasey was extremely efficient and explained all the steps to ordering for a large party so the whole process went quickly and smoothly. The food and drinks came out promptly and everything was delicious. While it was busy, we did not feel rushed at any point, and Kasey took the time to chat with our party and make us feel welcome. Another staff member also came over to congratulate one of our family members on a milestone that we were celebrating. Great experience overall."
East Side Mario's (Kingston),3,"Well, usually ESM is my go-to, favorite place for lunch out. Although this location is nice, it's clean, the servers are lovely, it was most definitely not the best meal.  Again, service was fantastic.  But the rest left little to be desired.  The bread wasn't fully cooked, the soup was tepid at best and my appetizer was overcooked . We ordered the chicken Parm bites.  Had they not been overcooked, they would have been quite tasty.  My main entree was not even remotely warm.  I always order the cheese cappelletti, and had it been actually hot it would have been yummy.  The service was quick so I'm not sure why the temperature of our food wasn't where it should have been.  Sigh.  Again, not the server's fault and she was tipped very well.  It will definitely be a while before I visit this particular location though."
East Side Mario's (Kingston),1,"Decided to dine in since we had ordered skip one night and enjoyed it.

Brought our family of 5 it started out strong with minimal wait on getting our drinks and food order placed. However that‚Äôs where it took a turn for the worse.

I had ordered a house salad and soup for my mains which came out at the same time as everyone else‚Äôs starters which ultimately left me sitting there awkwardly as everyone else ate, after an ungodly long wait for their mains. Even after waiting so long the pastas were both rubbery and dry making 75% of the dishes inedible, the pizza that came out was okay at best. One of the kids said theirs was ‚Äúmeh‚Äù and the other commented saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs dry, even the pineapple is dry‚Äù. My house salad I ordered (due to the fact I‚Äôm vegetarian) had a hair in it when I arrived which I decided to just eat around since our server/bartender was nowhere to be found. Later found bacon in it at which point I called it quits, the tomato soup I ordered tasted like glorified tomato sauce. Overall was a waste of our time and money, won‚Äôt be back and won‚Äôt order take out again due to the fact they clearly don‚Äôt care and have subpar kitchen standards.

Our server saw the untouched food and not so much as asked how anything was, not even once. Save yourself this experience and call it a pass."
Ghost Kitchen Brands (Bath Rd),5,"Incredible food incredible service friendly staff I couldn't think of a more perfect place to be able to try multiple restaurants because this place is multiple restaurants within one location it is a unique experience to Kingston because when you go inside you don't see staff everything is a touchscreen ordering system the only time you will see a staff member is when your drink and food is ready.

I have became friends with two of the staff members they are two wonderful people and I couldn't ask for better friends like them to me they are more than friends they are family"
Ghost Kitchen Brands (Bath Rd),1,"Wow.

These fetid, fungal, abominations arrived. There‚Äôs mold, and then there‚Äôs ‚Äúthe box has internal condensation from decomposition‚Äù. Could have been an episode of NCIS. Cinnabons should be brown, white, golden and delicious. Teal, chartreuse, and puce should not be a part of my cinnabon experience. Kingston, this Can‚Äôt be trusted."
Ghost Kitchen Brands (Bath Rd),1,"I have ordered from ghost kitchens previously on Uber eats and I enjoyed my order a lot, so me and a friend decided to go to Ghost Kitchens in person this afternoon to check out the location .
When we went in I went to the cash and waited at least 7 minutes for an employee to come out, when he did come out we were required to order off of the wall machines instead of ordering at the cash.
We went ahead and tried to use the machines, we got our order completed and when I proceeded to pay, but their debit machine would not work. It sent my order to the cash so I went up to ask to pay there In which i was able too. Thankfully.
I noticed my order was double the price it said on the machine.. something was added to my order accidentally they said, and  When I explained that is why I wanted to order at the cash because I prefer to place my order with an actual person rather than a machine..: the employee looked at me and said could you please go re order on the machines‚Ä¶
I was extremely disappointed by this time. I had already spent at least 25minutes in the store‚Ä¶ the employee was short with his words as well as rude, he didn‚Äôt show any concern or empathy, at this point I just left the store‚Ä¶

In my opinion, service can determine if a business will make or break it‚Ä¶ as much as I enjoyed there stuff when I  ordered it for delivery, I will never go back to Ghost Kitchens due to the experience I had today. That employee ruined it for me and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going here to anyone, they are far from accommodating"
Ghost Kitchen Brands (Bath Rd),1,Don't order from this place. It needs to be closed. I order a sub that had no onions in the description and comes with alfredo sauce. The sub was made with lots of onions and some kind of sauce I couldn't even guess what it was. But definitely wasn't white Alfredo sauce. Taste so bad even my dog wouldn't eat it.
Ghost Kitchen Brands (Bath Rd),3,"i enjoyed my cinnabon, there was a hair‚Ä¶ but regardless it was hot and good. took only five mins. ate in, great experience and was very fun experience. DISCLAIMER Hair was found near the end"
Sima Sushi,4,"üìçSima Sushi

‚≠êÔ∏è8/10

55 pc party tray - $69.95
Red dragon - $14.95

Sima sushi is a great downtown Kingston sushi option! Since it's sushi, it is definitely on the pricier side, but the quality is nice. They also currently don't have dine-in so you will have to find a place to eat elsewhere. We got the 55 piece party tray, which was a decent size for 4 people. They also provide gluten-free soy sauce and certain sushi items upon request!

**For more, follow @smfoodd on Instagram!!"
Sima Sushi,5,"sushi dinner and sashimi dinner are 10/10ÔºÅÔºÅ! Just look at those thick cut sashimi, $25 for 18pcs sashimi? You can‚Äôt find a better deal in town. Let alone the freshness of those fish. Definitely my go to place for sushi~"
Sima Sushi,5,"The chirashi and deluxe sushi are fantastic. Very well seasoned rice and large pieces of fresh fish. The special torched rolls are delicious! No reservations accepted, but the small restaurant fills up fast!"
Sima Sushi,5,"Ordered takeout for the first time from here, and we all agreed the food was AMAZING!  Definitely highly recommend the Dynamite dragon, and the double torched spicy roll was out for this World, the Yam tempura roll was excellent!"
Sima Sushi,2,"The food is good quality but literally every time we order (which is fairly often), it takes two hours to get to us. We live a 5 minute walk away. They are in over their heads and taking more orders than they can reasonably fill in order to make more money."
241 Pizza (Kingston),1,Asked for chilli flakes on side. This is what i got. Who can eat this all red Pizza. Never had an issue like this before. But this time I don‚Äôt know who made it. But very very bad quality and taste. Cannot even eat it because its tooo spicy.
241 Pizza (Kingston),1,The staff behaviour was very rude. They don‚Äôt even know how to talk with the customers. Rest pizza was good but they have to respect the customers and should be behave politely.
241 Pizza (Kingston),4,"I reviewed this restaurant last year around November with one star about personal hygiene and overall hygiene and I see they changed a lot this year in a very good way. Thank you for bringing good changes to the business and thank you for the clean environment you have created now. Your pizza is delicious but pricey compared to Pizza Pizza and your small pizza costs like medium of them, I hope you can do something about it and you would be the best."
241 Pizza (Kingston),2,Messy atmosphere and religious propaganda right in my face while I'm just trying to get a pizza.. ... food and cults don't belong. Awful.
241 Pizza (Kingston),5,Order from here often and it's been a great experience every time. Great vegan options including vegan cheese for meals. 241 is the only place I've been able to find in the city so far that I can order a pasta from. My only regret about 241 Pizza is not trying them sooner! Thank you my friends!! :)
Maki sushi & noodle,5,"Beautiful little place, tucked away in a plaza on 15. Atmosphere is lovely and the staff are very polite! Salmon nigiri is the best you‚Äôll ever have! Come enjoy your new favourite restaurant in Kingston!"
Maki sushi & noodle,4,"The sushi was good and recommendable, I ordered the black dragon roll. The Japanese ramen tasted good, but didn't surprise me, there was very little soup in the noodles and it can be a little dry to eat. The location is not close to Queen's University and dt, but very close to rmc!"
Maki sushi & noodle,5,"Love our neighbourhood sushi place! The friendliest staff, and the food is amazing. My only suggestion is please bring back the tofu options for the rice & noodle dishes! Plant based protein is super important for those who don‚Äôt eat meat."
Maki sushi & noodle,5,"Although they are hybrid service, I like their service and foods.  Udon taste good and sushi is as expected.  Good to try."
Maki sushi & noodle,5,"For anyone that likes affordable high-end food, this is the place to go. I'm cheap but appreciate quality food and this was the best sushi I've EVER had. It was fresh, well presented but what really stood out was how tasty the rice and salmon was. I've never had rice that delicious ! The salmon was incredible and they use REAL WASABI. I've eaten in almost every sushi place in Kingston and this was the only one that actually used real wasabi and it was AWESOME !  Well done Maki and thank you for introducing a genuine sushi experience to Kingston !"
Sushiya Zen,3,"Food was ok. Fresh.
Like ordering in a wearhouse. Takeout only now. Looks sad, rundown, full of storage. Prices kind of high."
Sushiya Zen,5,"Salmon chirashi: 5/5, the salmon itself is so fresh and it just melts on your tongue. I also like the seaweed and spice they put on the rice. The green onion on top is also an interesting twist. Only one suggestion tho, there could have been more avocado to balance the whole dish."
Sushiya Zen,5,"Delicious food, very nice and friendly staff, reasonable price. Nicely decorated, good music, pleasant place to have your meal.

Lots of options in the menu. Would only suggest to include the traditional salmon roll in the menu (only options were salmon+cucumber roll or the spicy salmon roll).

Also, the sauce for chicken Katsu and pork Katsu were tasting different from the traditional recipe, but it was also good. I like it. :)"
Sushiya Zen,4,"Our first visit and we were not disappointed. The tuna, unagi, and red snapper sushi were fresh and tender. The agedashi tofu was good, wish there was a little more sauce though. The rolls were well done, rice was excellent, but we definitely preferred the unagi roll and deluxe dynamite over the spicy tuna which was a bit mushi in texture. Sima Sushi is our fav in Kingston, Sushiya is probably in our top five."
Sushiya Zen,5,"Awesome Food! One of the best sushi houses I've ever been to. Service as just ok, but decently efficient and polite."
FIVE GUYS GARDINERS (ON-1562),5,"First time there and I'll definitely be going back. Delicious, fast friendly service and great atmosphere"
FIVE GUYS GARDINERS (ON-1562),5,"Great service, great burger and fries 15 minute turn around from ordering and getting back to our car with our order. It was busy.
Love that I can get my burger wrapped in lettuceüòç‚úÖ got my peanuts in the shell at the entranceüëç and though busy on a Friday 6ish time. The flow was efficient and orderly. Like that one of the employee took the garbage bin to the bathroom corridor to change the bin bag and then bring it back to it's location. Give that a 5 star and a favourite place to eat in town. Keep up the great service and work as a team."
FIVE GUYS GARDINERS (ON-1562),5,"A solid 5/5 ""Five Guys"" location. Clean, full of ""Five Guys"" enthusiasm and energy. The quality of the fries alone justify the trip. Crisp, fresh homelike old school fries."
FIVE GUYS GARDINERS (ON-1562),5,"Fantastic burger and fries. Excellent selection of toppings. My family has soy and gluten allergies, no problem!"
FIVE GUYS GARDINERS (ON-1562),5,5 guys burgers and fries are always good never had nothing but yummy goodness for this place
Melt&Grill,4,This has the food preparation speed of a fast food restaurant with the quality of a restaurant. There is a wide selection of food options available to select from. The sitting area is small but always available. However  the staff dont always clearly communicate what comes with the food and when your food is ready.
Melt&Grill,5,We order from this place all the time it‚Äôs a smaller place which I love we have enough chains like McDonald‚Äôs here. The food here is soooo good and very very well priced. The wait is never long and even with a long delivery time the food is crispy. Just recently tried the pulled pork poutine tonight. And wow. The best pulled pork poutine I‚Äôve ever had I could taste everything the pork flavour is perfect there wasn‚Äôt too much gravy. I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.
Melt&Grill,5,"I‚Äôm vegetarian and got the veggie melt, it was phenomenal! Food came out pretty fast and was really good. There isn‚Äôt too much seating, but our group of 7 sat down across two tables and it worked great for our meal."
Melt&Grill,1,"Just went there today.

We ordered Veg. Momos , Veg poutine, Onion rings.
- Onion rings were okay.
- Do not try to re-invent the wheels. Poutine is always made with longs cut fries. Veg poutine does not mean to have just veg gravy. It should have some toppings as well with this price. Just call it classic poutine with veg gravy. Taste was okay.
- Momos had no taste.

Overall food quality vs price was not okay. You should think about walk in customers rather than online customers. Focus on food quality or bring the price lil down.

Would not go again !!!"
Melt&Grill,5,I ate potato cutlet with Indian touch and it was very tasty. The staff is also really good and friendly. I will definitely visit there again.
Harvey's (Norwest Road),4,Service was great. Aroo goes out of her way to make you welcome and well received. She is attentive and fast. Always a smile. This is the type of person any business should be proud of and happy to have working for them.
Harvey's (Norwest Road),5,"The new management have made a huge difference to this location. Harvey's burgers have been our family's favourite fast food place. The quality of the food has always depend on the location you buy it from in Kingston, (I find this personally).
We went with our family to dine in, the service was excellent, the cashier and cooks were extremely friendly, food was fresh and yummy and I would definitely go back more often to this location.
Accessibility, location, parking and cleanliness all 5 stars."
Harvey's (Norwest Road),5,Alex is amazing! Always makes sure my order is perfect. Thank you Alex and I appreciate the hard work you and your colleagues do every day. You are all amazing! Best Harvey‚Äôs in town. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Harvey's (Norwest Road),1,"Very rude.
Employees talking own language when they are serving to customers.  And also they are just throwing the bun.
I feel so sorry for the owner hiring wrong employees."
Harvey's (Norwest Road),5,"I recently visited this fast food restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the speedy service. The food was hot and fresh, and tasted just like I remembered. The prices were reasonable and I will definitely be back!"
Little Caesars (507 Princess Street),4,"Let‚Äôs be honest, you‚Äôre not expecting gourmet anything out of this little Caesars. But, the convenience and price makes this place top of my emergency lunch list. No other place you can walk in, walk out in 30 seconds with a pretty good medium pizza for under $10 these days. A bonus is that the staff are also always great. This is a number one option for anyone in a pinch for lunch or dinner while downtown."
Little Caesars (507 Princess Street),4,Friendly staff.  Food was what you would expect from Little Caesars.   The order area was a little dirty and the floor definitely needed to be washed.   The kitchen area looked much cleaner!
Little Caesars (507 Princess Street),3,"This is the 2nd time they've made what should have been a delicious simple pizza taste awful. Little Cesaers...what is happening to you? Three words...quality quality quality! In the Great North, this should be the bare minimum standard. I ordered a coupon pizza, yeah I know, the coupon orders aren't treated the same as the non coupon orders, atleast that what it looked and tasted like to me. Man, I am getting tired of my nagging reviews, but the truth has to be shown. I mean it's all about show and tell since Gr 3. Anyways, back to the story...waited and got my warm pizza with a smile from the friendly staff. Walked it home in under 10 mins. Put it on my countertop and went to go buy some Pop Shoppe and Jones soda cause I support local right. Get home and move the pizza box over to find an oily residue on the counter top where I left the pizza box. Opened up the box and man oh man, it's like they poured oil on the pizza for jokes and giggles. So I called them, they were very friendly about the mistake, oh golly gosh, I felt bad for making a fuss. But I had too, because, well look at the pictures for yourself. So they tell me that they apply garlic butter and next time I got tell them that they need to go light on the garlic butter because you know, there are no formal standard training or procedures on how to make a franchise pizza dish for Lil Cesaers? They definitely break barriers and think outside the box at this location. Maybe the pizza specialist doesn't know the definition of drizzle? Will have to explain that to them next time I order, and I am not leaving the store until after inspecting the goods. Yes, it has come down to this...#Embrassing. The raccoons will eat well tonight though..."
Little Caesars (507 Princess Street),4,"Great employees, fast clean location. Really sad to see the option to tip employees via debit is gone, when I worked here it really helped me out."
Little Caesars (507 Princess Street),5,"Fast, cheap, and contactless when you order with your phone.

Always good, on time and correct."
Izumo Sushi,3,"I‚Äôve ordered from Izumo a few times to try it out before doing a full review.

When I first went here they were still open for dine in and I loved how intimate the dining area was. Though it‚Äôs quite small, it‚Äôs not often busy. Since Covid they started doing takeout only. They also *usually* give a discount when you pay with cash like most sushi places. Lately they‚Äôre doing a 20% discount on cash payments.

They are a family owned business and have very kind customer service. If you‚Äôre ordering in a large group and getting one of the party trays, you‚Äôll be paying a bit less than other sushi places in the area, however the size of their maki rolls are smaller than most places. The quality can be hit or miss, I have gone sometimes and found the fish didn‚Äôt smell as fresh or that some pieces were a bit dry unfortunately.

That being said, my most recent experience with them was positive; our order was ready on time, we got a 20% discount for paying with cash, and they packed a small container of soy sauce for each of us - we all like different levels of wasabi in our soy sauce, so this was lovely. Most of our sushi pieces tasted fresh and the maki rolls all had a unique flavour to them, which was nice.

Sushi is one of my favourite foods, I eat it at least once a week. In Kingston, I have three favourite sushi places that are hard to beat in terms of quality and taste. Therefore I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be back here anytime soon for sushi. Instead I‚Äôll return when they open indoor dining and try out their noodle dishes."
Izumo Sushi,1,"I ordered food last night and when the order came incorrect I called the restaurant to inform them. They flat out admitted that when they are busy they will give the customer whatever they have available, I have never heard of that in my life. The food went into the garbage as no one liked what they gave us, they didn‚Äôt even bother checking if anyone was allergic to this random sushi we were given instead, possibly poisoning/killing someone. No apology was given in any way, shape or form. The lady kept asking me over and over what sushi I got instead like answering that question would somehow make things better. No refund was offered in the slightest, I had to ask for one. Generally I would have shrugged this off but this was possibly the worse service I‚Äôve ever had."
Izumo Sushi,1,"takoyaki is frozen not fresh octopus is like eating rocks because it is months old. Very disappointing. I've to mention everything else I ordered was rotten.

I recommend nobody eating here untill they can meet sanitary and cooking  standards or you will get sick"
Izumo Sushi,2,"This was quite disappointing. All of these rolls but none of them had much, if any flavour. Almost couldn‚Äôt differentiate one roll from another. To boot we only received one tiny container of soy sauce for all of this sushi and after tax, tip and delivery it cost over $90! Unfortunately, won‚Äôt be ordering again."
Izumo Sushi,2,We ordered for the first time since moving to Kingston. Over the phone they were very pleasant. Picked up order only to find out when we got home that a roll was missing. When called they said we would have to drive all the way back downtown to get it or get a refund in person only.  Therefore one child didn‚Äôt get their dinner order. At first glance the rolls looked well made except for the avocado which was old and very brown and spotted even before opening the clear lid. Was not worth the $71 we spent.
Apsara Angkor Cuisine Restaurant,5,"The best Thai food I have ever had. The coconut shrimp is bliss, the Tom yum soup seems to have fresh seafood, and the sticky rice is heaven. When I go back to Kingston again, I will surely revisit!

The bathrooms were squeaky clean and smelled wonderfully. The staff seemed to be tired, but were still polite."
Apsara Angkor Cuisine Restaurant,5,"This is a great establishment! We had dinner here and we were a little nervous at first. But we weren't disappointed in the least!!

We got a seat right next to the fireplace and it was most definitely the best seat in the house! The fireplace made it feel so cozy!
If you can, try and get that spot!  üòâ

Our waitress was fantastic! Her name was Vanessa and she was just great! Very timely with refills of our glasses. Plus she was very kind with a great, elegant energy! She gave us really great suggestions on the classic, best dishes that were the favorites.

The food was great and the service was fast. We were very pleased. And it tasted incredible üòã If you go, you should try the vegetarian noodles with the cashews! The crunch of the cashews was a great touch to the soft noodles!"
Apsara Angkor Cuisine Restaurant,4,Great food. Tried chicken pad thai and glass noodles. The Tom yum soup cleanses your palette and has a good spice level. Paid Parking is available on Ontario St ahead of city hall at minimal rates.
Apsara Angkor Cuisine Restaurant,5,"Wow what a great gem we walked in as we felt like having Thai and we were just staying around the corner, staff very welcoming friendly helpful we were hungry and looking through the menu went with soup then spring rolls vegetable and meat sweet and sour prawns and ginger chicken all amazing really enjoyed sweet and sour prawns all in all a great dinner service is really organized and fast we ordered the starters and they were out very quickly and the mains also will certainly look forward to going back."
Apsara Angkor Cuisine Restaurant,5,"Looking for a great, affordable and authentic Thai and Cambodian restaurant in Kingston look no further because this place is it!

Food was absolutely delicious and was served with very professional and friendly staff.

Will be definitely coming back in the near future for yet another amazing meal.

Thank you!"
KFC (29 Warne Crescent),1,"Every time I have KFC I remind myself why I don't eat KFC
But this one worst experience in kfc.
I ordered basket-18 and drink, she forgot to put my drink, napkins. I came back again, another guy gave my drink even didn't say sorry. Worst guys they dont know how to talk to customers."
KFC (29 Warne Crescent),1,"We stopped at your location on Saturday, April 9 to try again after the last meal was terrible in hopes it had improved. Not so. That chicken was dry and over cooked and basically tasteless. The service was fast but that is all I can say about this business. Unfortunately for you we will not try again."
KFC (29 Warne Crescent),1,"So its Friday! Parking lot packed and people driving in and this location and Princess St and I assume the rest close doors at 8pm! Seriously? Beside the 401?????
You had loads of people wanting food and you close like clockwork. Are you kidding me????
I went to Popeyes!"
KFC (29 Warne Crescent),1,"Not very happy! Was just there tonight to get a 14 piece meal that‚Äôs comes with four side! Plus fries! We ordered paid and left and started to check our bag and we did not receive our fries nor a receipt! So I went back and said politely we did not get our fries and the guy that didn‚Äôt not take my order says he was listening to the woman taking out ordered and then decides to have the nerve to keep shoving the receipt in my face saying ‚Äúsee no fries‚Äù
And proceeded to accuse me of lying about French fry‚Äôs! Note we ordered gravy so obviously we would have ordered French fry‚Äôs for the gravy. Just common sense that fry‚Äôs go with gravy!"
KFC (29 Warne Crescent),5,"Wow. I love KFC. There is nothing better than Dirty Bird. This location has super friendly staff and the chicken always comes out hot and fresh. The Colonel would be proud. I would have included a photo of the chicken, but I ate it all!"
Pizza Studio (Kingston),3,"Operating under a similar concept to Score Pizza, which is further down Princess St, it's essentially a build-your-own-pizza store.

It's certainly less busy than Score and you actually get to see the ingredients in front of you as opposed to picking just from a list.

However, for $14 for a relatively small pizza, it's definitely not worth the price.  Especially with the very small amounts of toppings that are put on the pizza. The pizza tastes pretty average.

The store itself is medium-sized and has a blue and white theme with seating."
Pizza Studio (Kingston),4,A local pizza place good for a late night meal or one for when you are stressing. I've been once myself and tagged along once with a friend. The pizza is about the cost of score or other local pizza places. There are preset pizzas or make your own. They also have a big selection of ice creams and fried sides. I think the food was good for what it is.
Pizza Studio (Kingston),5,"I had gone to Pizza Studio with my friends. We ordered for tandoori paneer poutine. And, to be honest, it was so delicious. The customer service by two girls- one in a turban and the other one with spectacles was amazing and they were friendly. The ambience with music was so good. And, you should be happy that now we are your regular customers."
Pizza Studio (Kingston),5,"I visited here last week on Monday. I order a tandoori paneer poutine and a veg pizza. That was delicious. They have many Indian flavours.
Staff is very polite and excited to serve."
Pizza Studio (Kingston),1,"They change price for custom pizza on there convenience, every time I visit its different that doesn‚Äôt make sense i order same thing. There food and service is gd though"
Pizza Pizza (414 Princess),1,"Wow, such a disgusting attitude. They made a mistake , we ordered the pizza with creamy garlic sauce but they made it with tomato sauce. When we raised the concern the guy said they were out of creamy garlic sauce. Through out the visit they were giving nasty looks, we didn‚Äôt even say anything or made an issue. Never coming back, felt threatened by the attitude of the staff."
Pizza Pizza (414 Princess),1,"Ordered a large size cauliflower bites‚Ä¶ box was not even half full. Most of the time I order from different location, I know the portion.
I called customer service, did not respond properly, he put me on the hold without asking, then hanged up on me."
Pizza Pizza (414 Princess),1,This Place is just simply disappointment all the time I have ordered. This time the Pizza was simply undercooked. Even the chhese on the top didn't melt. Coomon dude. Check what you making before giving it tothe customer.
Pizza Pizza (414 Princess),1,"We ordered a garlic base large pizza and he gave some other sauce as the base instead of what we ordered,when I enquired about it he said they only have tomato as base.He didn‚Äôt said that at the time he took the order or atleast he wasn‚Äôt sorry about that.
The behaviour of the guy who worked today was horrible.He was acting rude."
Pizza Pizza (414 Princess),1,"I would leave zero stars if I could. I was a visitor in Kingston for the weekend and want to share my food experience of this store with you.
The Indian Girl prepared my order. I ordered Pizza with 4 Toppings and what I received is just a cheese crust with 2-4 pieces of each topping.
The food is Zero for the price and to make it even worse it is not even close to authentic.
You should not call yourself a Pizza Pizza Franchise. The service ridiculously whitewashed.
Literally, Don‚Äôt go there, they are not worth it."
Shawarma El Mina,1,"I ordered chicken poutine, chicken platter and chicken fry today....both had a disgusting odor from the dish and chicken was not tasted fresh. I am a regular visitor of this shop and I am familiar with the taste. For sure they packed   terrible chicken in my takeout....I will not recommend this restaurant anymore. I spent $41 for chicken poutine, chicken platter and chicken fry. I believe they packed remaining from previous day. It was a waste of money tonight."
Shawarma El Mina,5,"Friendly staff, food quality was satisfactory, price was reasonable for the quantity, , parking available, HALAL"
Shawarma El Mina,4,"I went in at lunch to grab a quick bite to go. I ordered the chicken shawarma. The sandwich was built to my liking in front of me. Fresh lettuce, tomato, pickles, hot peppers, and an excellent sweet sauce. The chicken was piled high and before wrapped they put it in a sandwich press to brown the pita and warm everything up. For just under $10, it was a terrific sandwich. The service (a younger guy and I assume the owner) greeted me with a friendly hello and even though it was busy they had in out the door quickly.
I would have given 5's on everything but the interior looked like it needed some attention - tired and worn.
The food and service - a definite 5++. I'll be back!"
Shawarma El Mina,5,"Good food, a little pricey but no qualms there because it‚Äôs good quality. Sauces are balanced and don‚Äôt overpower other flavours. The shawarma was well put together and didn‚Äôt dismantle while eating. Portions were sizeable and the owners feel like warm people. Overall, it makes for a perfect mom n pop shop."
Shawarma El Mina,5,Hands down to the best Falafel in Ontario! My husband tried their shawarma plate and he loved it too. Must eat for us on the way to Montreal/quebec or when in Kingston. The person who owns/serves the place/food is the kindest and another reason to be there. Thank you so much.
Minos Take Out West,4,"We ordered the Golden Shrimp Platter for takeout and it was delicious! The shrimps were cooked well, butter and garlicky. The salads were fresh, veggies were great and the carb portion was good. We shared it between 2 adults and had quite a bit leftover.

The only downside was we were told it‚Äôll be 20 minutes before it was ready for pick up and when we got there, they then started putting the order together so we had to wait another 20 minutes (it wasn‚Äôt even busy). Also, the store could also do with some cleaning, our shoes were sticking to the floor. Our pickup order was for lunch on a weekday. Hopefully they‚Äôll sort the conditions out, while continuing to make great greek food!"
Minos Take Out West,5,Great place. We go there for the pork soulvacki uncooked to bring home and throw on the BBQ. Their Greek salad is really good as well! Reasonable prices and friendly helpful staff.
Minos Take Out West,4,"Restaurant was clean, tables outside were sanitized just before I sat down to eat, all staff wore ppe and followed strict covid guidelines. I ordered a medium Greek salad for lunch. It was fresh, portion was huge and the homemade salad dressing was delicious!"
Minos Take Out West,1,"GROSS FOOD!!
shrimp has the shell on it and saut√©ed, apparently they don't have pita only stale white bread. I ordered oven roasted potatoes with lemon... they were old potato wedges that were deep fried.
I thought I ordered Greek food, what I got was sub-par bar food with taziki that was O.K.
Probably because they bought it. All food is frozen then fried. Eww"
Minos Take Out West,2,"I just had what used to be the best ceasar salad around.
What have you done and why? It did not resemble the salad I have been eating all these years. So disappointed."
"Mary Brown's Chicken (656 Gardiners Road, Unit 20a)",5,"We live in PEC but whenever we visit Kingston we usually drop in here for take out ‚Ä¶. Food is always delicious ‚Ä¶even the leftovers on the second evening still taste great üëçjust love it ‚Ä¶. Staff very friendly and accommodating ‚Ä¶.let me switch out a gravy for coleslaw last time ‚Ä¶.we had to wait 10 minutes for the food on our last visit but it was worth every minute!
See you soon üòä"
"Mary Brown's Chicken (656 Gardiners Road, Unit 20a)",4,"Ordered through skip the dishes. They missed part of my order while packaging, called the restaurant, I wasn't the most pleasant. They were more then helpful, and delivered the missed item I'm their own vehicle. I should add that skip routed me to one across town, not the closest one to my house. Appreciate the customer service."
"Mary Brown's Chicken (656 Gardiners Road, Unit 20a)",1,"Feels like every once in five visit, we get completely unseasoned chicken. Don't know if it has anything to do with the timeframe you buy em but when you do, it's like eating cardboards with a thin layer of flavored coating. Never got replies from support emails. I do not wish for any compensation, just better quality control with your brinings. Thank you."
"Mary Brown's Chicken (656 Gardiners Road, Unit 20a)",1,"Horrible customer service, for both my mom and I in 2 separate encounters. I'm not sure whether you only have racist cashiers/servers, but I will never return. They are horrible!!!"
"Mary Brown's Chicken (656 Gardiners Road, Unit 20a)",5,5 star everyone is so friendly and kind the supervisor Sarah is amazing and kind they delivered the food straight to my table and the food was amazing üëçüèª will visit again
The Cheesecake Factory Bakery by Ghost Kitchens (Bath Rd),5,"Incredible food incredible service friendly staff I couldn't think of a more perfect place to be able to try multiple restaurants because this place is multiple restaurants within one location it is a unique experience to Kingston because when you go inside you don't see staff everything is a touchscreen ordering system the only time you will see a staff member is when your drink and food is ready.

I have became friends with two of the staff members they are two wonderful people and I couldn't ask for better friends like them to me they are more than friends they are family"
The Cheesecake Factory Bakery by Ghost Kitchens (Bath Rd),1,"Wow.

These fetid, fungal, abominations arrived. There‚Äôs mold, and then there‚Äôs ‚Äúthe box has internal condensation from decomposition‚Äù. Could have been an episode of NCIS. Cinnabons should be brown, white, golden and delicious. Teal, chartreuse, and puce should not be a part of my cinnabon experience. Kingston, this Can‚Äôt be trusted."
The Cheesecake Factory Bakery by Ghost Kitchens (Bath Rd),1,"I have ordered from ghost kitchens previously on Uber eats and I enjoyed my order a lot, so me and a friend decided to go to Ghost Kitchens in person this afternoon to check out the location .
When we went in I went to the cash and waited at least 7 minutes for an employee to come out, when he did come out we were required to order off of the wall machines instead of ordering at the cash.
We went ahead and tried to use the machines, we got our order completed and when I proceeded to pay, but their debit machine would not work. It sent my order to the cash so I went up to ask to pay there In which i was able too. Thankfully.
I noticed my order was double the price it said on the machine.. something was added to my order accidentally they said, and  When I explained that is why I wanted to order at the cash because I prefer to place my order with an actual person rather than a machine..: the employee looked at me and said could you please go re order on the machines‚Ä¶
I was extremely disappointed by this time. I had already spent at least 25minutes in the store‚Ä¶ the employee was short with his words as well as rude, he didn‚Äôt show any concern or empathy, at this point I just left the store‚Ä¶

In my opinion, service can determine if a business will make or break it‚Ä¶ as much as I enjoyed there stuff when I  ordered it for delivery, I will never go back to Ghost Kitchens due to the experience I had today. That employee ruined it for me and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going here to anyone, they are far from accommodating"
The Cheesecake Factory Bakery by Ghost Kitchens (Bath Rd),1,Don't order from this place. It needs to be closed. I order a sub that had no onions in the description and comes with alfredo sauce. The sub was made with lots of onions and some kind of sauce I couldn't even guess what it was. But definitely wasn't white Alfredo sauce. Taste so bad even my dog wouldn't eat it.
The Cheesecake Factory Bakery by Ghost Kitchens (Bath Rd),3,"i enjoyed my cinnabon, there was a hair‚Ä¶ but regardless it was hot and good. took only five mins. ate in, great experience and was very fun experience. DISCLAIMER Hair was found near the end"
Thai House Cuisine,5,"We were very happy and impressed with Thai House! The server was very accommodating, she gave us enough time to decide, answered our questions and checked in on us just the right amount. I was surprised that the inside is a very nice sit-down restaurant, sturdy and clean tables and chairs, nice window seating options, calming music choice that is the right volume to allow for lovely conversations (though if you sit next to loud people it can be disturbing because you hear everything they're saying)

The food, oh my goodness, it was delicious.. i got a vegetarian pad thai with fried tofu and it truly was exquisite the best I ever had! I attached a photo (sorry it is mid-meal lol because i was too eager to eat it and forgot the idea to write a review). The sauce was smooth and had some sweetness to it, the vegetables are cooked just right not too soggy and not raw, just the right crunch, tofu was well marinated, and the noodles were bursting with flavor! I normally eat half the plate but i had to eat it all because i enjoyed it so much!

Next time i think i will try the sweet and sour fish, it sounds amazing!

One thing to suggest to the server is to ask if we need refills on our coffee/tea, we didn't know we could do that until the end and it was a bit too late."
Thai House Cuisine,5,"Delicious food and very friendly staff! I went recently with my mom and we ordered their stir-fried ginger beef, appetizer assortment and coconut soup with chicken. Each dish was filled with flavour and very fresh! The resturant also has a great atmosphere with plenty of bright, natural lighting."
Thai House Cuisine,5,Best Thai food we have had in Ontario. We have lived in Hong Kong for 28 years and travelled to THAILAND many times. The restaurant is very clean. The staff are super friendly and the food is EXCELLENT.  Had the Tom Yam soup the Pad Thai and the Red curry.  All well done. Catered for the extra spice as well. A DEFINITE RECOMMENDATION
Thai House Cuisine,5,We were seated promptly provided with water drinks and menus quickly. Given ample time to peruse the menu.  The food we ordered was delicious. We tried a drink at the wait persons suggestion to finish our meal that was lovely. Will definitely go back again.
Thai House Cuisine,5,Great little place with very friendly and welcoming staff as well as great authentic Thai food. I also loved how simple their menu is with one single pricing scheme for all the offerings available. Our little toddler had a blast with the staff too.. great experience
Guac Mexi Grill (Kingston),5,"I am from Toronto and was in Kingston for work and wanted something quick for lunch. Searched online for options and this store happened to be 3 mins away so decided to give it a try. Customer service was excellent, store was a little busier but still managed to get my lunch in no time. Food tasted really good and staff was fantastic, store looked pretty neat and clean. Would definitely recommend this place."
Guac Mexi Grill (Kingston),5,Best nachos in town . Great staff which makes the nachos more tasty. The best thing is gayatri makes according to how we want it . Highly recommended
Guac Mexi Grill (Kingston),5,"This new burrito spot just opened up and I think it's great! The staff are extremely friendly and welcoming and the interior is clean and well sanitized! While ordering, the staff members are patient and double check before adding anything! They also take their time to plate the food in an aesthetically appealing way! Really impressed! And of course, the food! The ingredients they use are fresh and taste great! Solid prices too considering what you're getting! Definitely recommend this place if you pass by! üòÅ"
Guac Mexi Grill (Kingston),1,"The WORST customer service experience I have ever had at a take out style restaurant. On the several occasions that I have been there, I have stood and waited for 10 minutes or more waiting for the employees working there to acknowledge me. Even when the store is empty they prioritize working in the back over taking orders and it feels like they don‚Äôt respect customers valuable time. For all the time they spend preparing there always seems to be empty bins of ingredients that they have to completely refill mid order which takes even longer. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating to have my time wasted. On top of that the employees often give what feels like dirty looks.

Food is okay. Worse than chipotle. Edible but mediocre at best.

If you go here be prepared to wait for nothing."
Guac Mexi Grill (Kingston),3,"Service was good, but the food was just okay. I agree with a previous review,  Chipotle is much better."
Boston Pizza (95 Dalton Ave),5,"It is a fantastic experience to have dinner here. I highly recommend the pasta and pizza, and I believe the chicken wing and steak are also worth to try! They also have the great televisions for you to watch some sports game! Great place to spend the time with your family or friends."
Boston Pizza (95 Dalton Ave),5,Our server Noushin G was wonderful as was our service and our food. The manager came around to all the patrons tables to ensure that all was well. Excellent experience and we will be back
Boston Pizza (95 Dalton Ave),1,"I wish I read the reviews on food before I came.

I‚Äôm a frequent at Boston Pizza in Manitoba and now in Newfoundland and I‚Äôve loved the food and atmosphere both always at any locations I‚Äôve been.

Just stopped here with family on my trip for dinner and wish I would have just stopped at a Pizza Hut and likely would have enjoyed the Pizza there better. Spent over $150 and had an Awful experience!

My plates were wet and had to wipe them with tissues myself, I asked for extra sauce and I could barely taste the sauce on my Pizza, my kids ordered Pasta and they eat a few bites and refused to eat more and didn‚Äôt want to take it home which is unusual for them. My nachos where mostly half raw as if they weren‚Äôt fully baked. The brand should really look into the quality of food served at this location.

I‚Äôm editing this review, to add to my miseries I just came to restroom and found no toilet paper! When I went to wash hands one dispenser had no soap and another one was dripping soap on the counter and didn‚Äôt look up to hygiene standards. I work as a GM in retail and proud of the restroom areas we have in our store and how well we maintain them. If there was a -5 star I would give it as a rating.

I will likely be worried stopping at a random Boston Pizza other than my regular locations with this experience."
Boston Pizza (95 Dalton Ave),5,"Loved the vibe of this place, Our Server was the sweetest.. super quick service! we just got beers and two sharable!! for the nachos, she recommended us to go half plate, thank god she did, that itself was too huge for us to finish‚Ä¶ The cactus cut potatoes was disappointing as most of it was almost burnt.. but over all good experience.. !!"
Boston Pizza (95 Dalton Ave),3,"Had lunch with family today, the service was excellent. We sat outside and had a little tough time with bees. The food was average the Thai  shrimp were excellent, the nachos were oily, the calamari was not great and presentation was terrible. The special Friday offer for pizza was on the expensive side $12 for a small pizza and it was really small."
Presotea (Kingston),5,"Took a celebratory trip to Kingston and decided to stop by for a quick boba and was definitely not let down! The staff were very friendly, and prepared the meal right away. I had the signature Boba and the fried chicken. Both were amazing! Will definitely be coming back again Thanks again! üßã"
Presotea (Kingston),3,"Tonkatsu ramen: 4/5, the noodles and the soup are good, the tonkatsu could been sliced thinner so it‚Äôs easier to chew

Mango green tea: nah, totally not worth $8, in my opinion, their food is ok, but their drink is over priced

Chicken karaage: 1/5, nothing special"
Presotea (Kingston),5,The food here is tasty. The service is always good. I would highly recommend their ramen. And the bubble tea is one of the best in Kingston! Btw their cheeses cake is amazing!
Presotea (Kingston),4,"The tonkatsu ramen and calamari were okay. I think it's the bubble tea that's worth getting here - lots of flavours to choose from with fresh, chewy tapioca. I wouldn't mind coming here again to try their other ramen."
Presotea (Kingston),5,I always love going here there food and tea are always delightful. And I really have to give them credit when it comes to customer service. I order online from skip and unfortunately they had run out of the food I order but provided me with a free drink which was absolutely delicious. 10/10 would definitely recommend!
Swiss Chalet (Dalton Ave),5,"We were in town for a soccer tournament and had our Saturday night team dinner with the players and parents here. The staff were fantastic and very accommodating. We had a group of close to 50 people so I expected it to be a big challenge. We were very impressed with how well organized the service was despite our large group. Every player, parent, coach, etc, said the food was great and would be happy to return here in the future. Thank you to the staff for taking great care of our group!"
Swiss Chalet (Dalton Ave),3,"My 96 year old grandfather was taking us out for lunch. After being our bill. My grandfather payed in cash. The server look at him and say how much change do you want back. What who says that. How rude!! I guess you we‚Äôre assuming you were getting a tip. Just give him his change back.  His change was around 18$. He left 8$, After we left he was concerned because he didn‚Äôt feel he left enough for a tip. If you had just given him his change. Your tip would have been bigger.  But you didn‚Äôt want to be bothered to make change or you were just making sure you got your tip. I don‚Äôt know what was going on. He did the math after we left and felt bad that he didn‚Äôt leave a better tip. But I guess you should just be happy with what you got.  This is not how you treat people. Just make the change and don‚Äôt assume your going to be tipped. This was greedy and rude. But I guess it backfired in this situation.  I was very disappointed with how she spoke to him."
Swiss Chalet (Dalton Ave),3,"We went there because of a coupan that was mailed to us! The deal was amazing, 2 can dine for $20! We each got a quarter chicken, one side of coleslaw and green salad.

One of the chickens unfortunately was undercooked, I could see the veins in the chicken and it was definitely not seasoned enough, so it had a chickeny taste to it and not in a good way! The other chicken however was cooked fine. The coleslaw was very tasty.

Overall worth the price of $20 for 2 people but otherwise not the best quality food‚Ä¶"
Swiss Chalet (Dalton Ave),1,"We decided to have take out for supper from Swiss chalet, what a mistake!!! My wife after working all day sat in a line up for over 20 minutes and only to get cold food! Called Swiss Chalet and talked the to franchise owner Maddie!! So he said?? He was not sorry and made excuses for the order! If you are local or out of town do not go to this location!! (Dalton Ave)"
Swiss Chalet (Dalton Ave),5,I‚Äôve eaten here many times for business meetings and personally. The welcome when you arrive and the food is as you‚Äôd expect ( great) and a very clean dining room and washroom makes it my go to for food I know will be cooked the way it‚Äôs supposed to be. No surprises. You know the owners are very hands on and make it an easy decision to keep coming back. Just tried the stir fry for the first time. Piping hot and really tasty. I‚Äôll order it again when I want to change it up!
Montana's (Kingston),4,"The food here was great. Decently priced, taste good and the service was very fast. Would definitely come back next time."
Montana's (Kingston),5,"From start to finish was a wonderful experience. Seated by a very polite young man. Savannah was our waitress. What a lovely human being. So attentive, personable and welcoming. Food was delish and arrived quickly, which was great seeing as we had our toddler to entertain. Highly recommend!"
Montana's (Kingston),5,"If I could give more than 5 stars I would.   Our server, Jacob, treated us like we were in his home.
From the moment we were greeted by the host I knew this was going to be a great time.
Best food I have had in a restaurant in forever!
The service was even better.!
Great Job Team!!!"
Montana's (Kingston),5,"Was at the Gardiners road location in Kingston and our hostess Paige was absolutely wonderful, she had such a bubbly personality & anything we needed she was on it! I will be back thanks to Paige :)"
Montana's (Kingston),5,"We went to the Gardiners location on Thursday June 29th, for my son and nephew's grade 12 grad, busy was an understatement, we had 2 extra guests than we expected but we're quickly accommodated with a patio table. Savannah, our server went ABOVE & BEYOND, kept us up to date with our food, being apologetic when they didn't have a couple menu items we wanted, and able to rhyme off her menu favourites to give us different ideas of what would be great recommendations to substitute for the other meal. She told our table a very funny story from her childhood and had fun with us when she was at our table. Savannah was outstanding with every bit of service she provided. We will be returning to this location, even though we live on the complete opposite side of town."
Burger King #3056 (1295 Oxford Street East),5,"I tried the new butter chicken burger and honestly I did not like it. It tasted weird. From now on I will stick with my all time favorite, the WHOPPER! Other than that Burger King Rocks! Cheers."
Burger King #3056 (1295 Oxford Street East),2,More of a food critic here then experience. Orderd there new breakfast bacon king and the new sausage cheezy melt and I will say not worth the money and kinda disappointed. Breakfast king had mayo and to much of it. And the melt well was like something I could have made at home I guess I was expecting crispy buttery bread like a Texas toast would definitely not order them again unless improved. I would give both sandwiches a 1 out of 10.
Burger King #3056 (1295 Oxford Street East),2,All the staff saw me and  absolutely ignored me taking my order after 10 minutes of waiting in an empty store. The store is always empty and doomed. I just love BK fries and Burger over McD that's why I go there. The staff can be more hospitable to a customer.
Burger King #3056 (1295 Oxford Street East),1,Went through drive through for delivery pickup and then I ask for regular fries on the window and they directly say No to it the said you have to order on the speaker not at the windsor. Wow thank you Burger King for the excellent service l
Burger King #3056 (1295 Oxford Street East),1,"The night staff at this place seems to work at a slow pace, giving the impression that they lack motivation. It appears as though they may not be adequately compensated for their efforts. Particularly, the Indian girl at the front cash who assembles the orders appears unmotivated. Improvement in their efficiency and motivation is necessary."
Frank & Burgers,4,"Delicious casual lunch. We tried the build your own hotdog / smash burger and the perogies. Definitely the best hotdog I‚Äôve ever had. Amazing french fries. Good service but strange ambiance, very busy with dozens of takeout orders being fulfilled for ghost kitchens. We will get takeout next time."
Frank & Burgers,5,"This is my third time trying them at Western Fair. The food is just perfect. The staff is ALWAYS super friendly. always makes me extra enjoyable.
So in love with this Chili Cheese Hotdog!!!
I am sure that I will come back again and again. If you visit Downtown area, please please don‚Äôt miss this place. Otherwise you will definitely regret."
Frank & Burgers,5,"The atmosphere is amazing! Was not busy at all. My boyfriend, son and I were very welcomed by the waitress there. She was super patient with us. Seeing as it was our first time there. My son is picky about food, and he loved it. The prices for the portions are perfect. Will definitely be going back soon"
Frank & Burgers,5,"What a gem of a place this is. I was looking for some late night eats near my hotel and this place was one of the only places open. Very happy I found it. It's a lively bar with a 24 hour kitchen. The bartender worked the room like a pro and somehow took care of the entire bar full of people without breaking a sweat. She remembered my name and made sure I was taken care of all throughout the night, while doing the same for everyone else in the bar. It was pretty refreshing to see such amazing service. It's rare these days!"
Frank & Burgers,1,Me and my gf ordered the franks platter tonight for 30 dollars expecting that it would be nice to take a Monday night off cooking but that was a mistake because it the order was butchered no wings at all came no sauces for the quesadilla and worst of all the mozza sticks literally had no cheese in them just crusty cold bread bites lol. Kind of pathetic im not here just trying to be rude but I almost chuckled at this. Gunna cook next time
Canteen (172 King St),5,"I just discovered Nooner's about a week ago after living in London most of my life!
This place is a real gem.
Let me rave for a moment.
The restaurant is clean and well kept, the food is homemade and absolutely delicious and super affordable.  The staff are friendly and welcoming.
I ordered the roast beef sandwich with coslaw and it was a satisfying portion without being too much food.
I will definitely keep going here and I highly recommend you try this place out. I've found a new place to dine that will keep me coming back!"
Canteen (172 King St),5,"Loved the sandwiches, environment, and pricing! Can't find better food at this price point in town. Will rave about the tarts forever!"
Canteen (172 King St),4,This place is a charmer for a quick snack or lunch downtown. The day-old pastries were a nice cheap treat when they were available.
Canteen (172 King St),5,Best quick lunch spot when working downtown! The prices are super reasonable. High quality fresh food that feels like a home-cooked meal at grandma‚Äôs.
Canteen (172 King St),5,"Slow cooked roast sandwich was amazing. I wanted the coleslaw on the sandwich and they delivered! Portions are alright for a lunch but the quality makes up for it. 4.5 but I‚Äôll round up.
Will be back."
Reset Social Cafe,5,"My go-to cafe in London! üòä

The staff are friendly, the coffee is delicious, and the juices and sandwiches are great too!

There's plenty of seating and outlets as well as free wifi. I've done work for a few hours here with no issues at all (after purchasing food/drink of course).

I looove the basil aioli they put on some of the sandwiches! ü§§ I also love how colourful the decor is. I get a lot of work done when I come here.

It looks like they also have board games on the shelves (by the seating that's around the corner near the bathrooms)."
Reset Social Cafe,1,"I am disappointed about the food and the service at Reset. I ordered Avocado Goat Cheese Sandwich and here was what I got. The bread was so soggy, the avocado and cabbage was spreading everywhere out of the wrap. It looked like a mess. I work at a building close to Reset, so it only took me 3 mins to open the bread after getting it at Reset.

As soon as l stepped away from the counter, the three girls started laughing. I don't  understand why they laughed right after I turned around.

I used to go to Reset a lot for lunch. They were way better than today. I will never go to Reset again. It's not worth the price."
Reset Social Cafe,5,"Love this cafe. Their ""Cafe Reset"" coffee is weirdly awesome and I always go for it. Sandwiches and wraps are tasty and healthy. The place has a good vibe with a lot of comfortable seating. You can also take your pup and can enjoy their outside seating space."
Reset Social Cafe,5,"Reset Social Cafe is a very well managed and elegant urban coffee house. Tables can be sometimes hard to find since they are usually taken by students that are studying but I respect that they added more seating options recently, even though they removed a large section in order to make room for coffee roasting. I love that they sell cold beer in cans and you can grab a six pack without heading to the store!"
Reset Social Cafe,5,"Just found this gem! Very healthy and delicious food and drinks here and a very chilled out vibe. I found this is a good place to socialize and to either work or study since it's not overly busy, comfortable seating and free wifi. Staff is friendly and the lady with the magenta hair is particularly awesome and has such a welcoming personality! I only wish it had more parking but it's downtown. Love the music that's played here and overall great atmosphere."
"Church's Texas Chicken (1030 Adelaide St N, London)",4,"Church's Texas Chicken sits in a strip mall in a fairly nondescript neighborhood. This is a small location but does have about 6 tables for dine in. It is well lit, whole looking new and clean.

I got the spicy chicken combo with onion rings on the side. This is probably the best chain restaurant for onion rings as the bite, seasoning and crunch are perfect. Really surprised about that. The chicken is good and is larger than most other competing franchises.

Service is polite although it does take 15-20 minutes in the early lunch order if you are ordering something other than chicken as they make them fresh.

Parking is shared in the lot but due to the location, I'd consider it ample. It may be a little more packed as it is next to a Dollarama, but the lot is large enough."
"Church's Texas Chicken (1030 Adelaide St N, London)",5,"Very good staff. Always so respectful and friendly. I love coming to this fried chicken joint as it is one of the best in London. Clean, affordable, and delicious"
"Church's Texas Chicken (1030 Adelaide St N, London)",5,"Omg, the fried chicken was fresh and juicy as hell. We also tried the biscuit and churros, they were amazing too. Their fried chicken was HUGE and a 4 pcs chicken combo was more than enough to feed 2 of us. The price is so cheap considering the size (seriously, how do you guys even make money???)
My only regret is not finding this place sooner, won‚Äôt be going to KFC or Popeyes anymore for sure.ü§™"
"Church's Texas Chicken (1030 Adelaide St N, London)",1,"Wanted to come for dinner, there is no accessable dor button, i called the store and all i got was a ""sorry for that"" and that she will pass my coment to the manager, and no offer to come hold the door open for me, as i am in a wheel chair and i cant managed to navigate into the store and hold the door open as my joystick is on the right and the door opens to.the right. If i could have rated lower for my experience i would have."
"Church's Texas Chicken (1030 Adelaide St N, London)",5,Fresh made to Order Is The Best !! I Love the Chicken especially the Breading .It's not Greasy Just Moist And juicy. The biscuits are The Real Winner Though As Even my 1 year Old daughter Loves them. 
Subway (355 Wellington St Unit 4),1,I asked for bag for food and this guy literally declined my ratings on Uber eats driver profile. Even I explained why I am asking. This is really not good
Subway (355 Wellington St Unit 4),5,I have had nothing but great experiences with this Subway! The ladies (and one gentleman that I've seen) are always polite. The cashier is pleasant and nice. It's nice to see the same happy faces whenever I go here.
Subway (355 Wellington St Unit 4),5,Great customer service ... Amazing response to my severe egg allergy ... Thanks!
Subway (355 Wellington St Unit 4),5,"What a deal! $7 meatball sub on managers special ? Yes please! Toasted to perfection, cheese melting, marinara gooing, mouth watering flavor party . I can not vouch for this sandwich shop more , my only complaint is I eat them so fast I have to set aside a part of an after noon to mourn the loss of such a brief but intense love affair . All hail Subway sandwiches and it's army of sandwich artists , may this location prosper for years to come !"
Subway (355 Wellington St Unit 4),4,"This subway holds a special place in my heart, as I've been coming to it since it opened in the basement of the Galleria.

More importantly, the staff there REMEMBER this, and regularly bring up that I must be one of their oldest customers.

It's a small thing, but it feels great."
McDonald's (Western),1,"This location has decided to close It's dining room ""due to maintenance "", but let's be honest that's just code for not wanting to serve the unhoused. They will accept mobile orders from 8-8, but no walk ins.

We went around 10pm, and we're close so we didn't drive. They only accept drive through orders after 8pm, and the staff mocked us for not driving. It was quite frankly,  a horrible experience. We were Instructed by an employee to order through uber, and have one of the 4 drivers in the parking lot hand it to us. This would have cost us double the amount. After verbally berating us, the employee went back inside and laughed at us through the window. We were polite,  but only met with hostility.

I suggest you go accrosd the street to babaaz shawarma,  support a small business instead."
McDonald's (Western),5,"This location is consistently quick getting orders out. I don't know who trains the people that work there, but they've done a fantastic job. Plus any staff I've encountered at the windows are always courteous. I wish every location was this organized and speedy - #1 McDonald's location all day long!"
McDonald's (Western),1,"The worst Mac I‚Äôve ever visited
The restaurant is dirty, I told them the table is not clean they gave me the sanitizer!!!
Washrooms are disgusting
There‚Äôs no cups for ketchup
The staff were saying bad words in very loud voice"
McDonald's (Western),1,"I order from here off uber eats often enough. The staff here are very incompetent. They couldn't read a chit if their lives depended on it. I always modify my food to my preference. 9/10 times, the staff fail to include the sauces I paid for, without the add on I end up throwing the bland food away. Do better."
McDonald's (Western),1,"The South Asian lady working at the second window on Saturday night has a terrible attitude.

Didn‚Äôt even say hello, slammed the window on us twice. Obviously I‚Äôm not expecting McDonald‚Äôs staff to be customer service oriented but it was all unnecessary. Coming from someone whose worked in fast food for over 2 years.

We weren‚Äôt even being difficult. Our order consists of two items.

Please teach your staff basic customer service skills and mannerisms."
Wendy's (676 Highbury Avenue),1,I ordered a strawberry lemonade at 10:25 today a guy gave my order he was so rude this was my first time trying wendys and the customer service was so bad . Lemonade was ok though
Wendy's (676 Highbury Avenue),4,"I recently visited the Wendy's location in London for breakfast and had a great experience. The food was delicious, and the prices were reasonable. Although I had a previous experience where my order was messed up, the staff was happy to fix it for me, free of charge and with no hassle. I appreciate their willingness to make things right and I will definitely go back to this restaurant and continue to enjoy their food."
Wendy's (676 Highbury Avenue),1,"Seems like every time I get a salad from this location it's always missing something.This time the Apple pecan salad was missing the red apple,cheese and cranberries.Husband got food from the drive-thru so of course when got home didn't expect to find missing items in the salad ordered again.Not the first time this has happened. Not happy. Staff need to make sure orders are put together properly"
Wendy's (676 Highbury Avenue),1,"Waiting in the drive thru for over 45 mins. Unacceptable. Line around the building, and they told us one second to take our order and we waited over 15 mins for her to come back."
Wendy's (676 Highbury Avenue),1,"There was what looks and feels like a chicken bone but the store told me all their chicken is boneless. Then wth is in my chili? They just told me to get a refund on uber. Thanks, because $6 makes up for the fact that my gum is bleeding and I put some foreign thing in my mouth. They can't even tell me what it is ü§¢ü§Æ"
Mary's Place,5,"My husband and I go to Mary's Place about every two weeks and have done so for about a year.  We have tried other breakfast restaurants and like Mary's Place the best.  I like a BLT and have certain standards that I like to be met, such as:  Crispy bacon that isn't greasy, a nice fresh tomato and crispy lettuce, all in a neat sandwich.  Mary's Place does this perfectly in my opinion.  The coffee is tasty also.  The waitresses are attentive and friendly.  They try to get to your table as soon as you sit down and ask for your beverage order.  The food, once ordered comes in a timely manner.  Hubby likes their Toasted Western with Home Fries.  We get the same orders each time we go.  We also like the homey atmosphere and it's not noisy or hectic like some places, even if all the tables are full."
Mary's Place,5,Ordered breakfast through Sikp the Dishes. Food was so good and the portion sizes are great. Recommended with five stars.
Mary's Place,5,Nothing fancy but definitely delicious - we especially loved how loaded the pancakes were with blueberries. Highly recommend!
Mary's Place,5,"Orderes for delivery. Good pricing, well packaged, was still hot and tasted great!"
Mary's Place,5,"In my opinion, the best breakfast and lunch take out in the area."
Harvey's (Highbury Ave),5,"Over the past couple weeks I‚Äôve held two dine-ins for the LTC home I work for. I‚Äôve had the pleasure of dealing directly with Danielle (restaurant manager) & her wonderful staff. Each large order I placed was handled with care, quality & efficiency. Danielle went above & beyond to ensure we had everything we needed in a timely fashion.
I truly appreciate your hard work, friendly attitude & welcoming atmosphere.

We‚Äôll definitely be back."
Harvey's (Highbury Ave),1,Bad customer service. I said there was like no gravy for my poutine. Then they said I had to pay extra. And the toppings for my burger. They where very stingy
Harvey's (Highbury Ave),4,"Smiles with courtesy- I like Congo pepper hot sauce, rather than standard hot sauces. Its a clean, well managed location. Seating a plenty IN a bright seating area.  Great Job!"
Harvey's (Highbury Ave),5,"This is one of the cleanest Harvey‚Äôs location I have ever seen. And they have amazing staffs with always smile on their face. I came today ( July 3rd) at around 6pm and there were a girl( If I am right, her name is Evelyn or Evalyn cause I heard other girl calling her like that) taking and garnishing my order. She was super fast and super nice eventhough i was a little bit picky. She and her colleagues did amazing job üíØüíØüíØ"
Harvey's (Highbury Ave),1,"I had a cheese burger only ketchup, French fries and an ice tea... I got food  Poisoning! I'm mostly assuming that it was from the burger because the taste was gross. It was the worst sickness I've ever gotten in my life"
Pita Pit (1255 Kilally Road),5,"Absolutely Delicious and very filling and I felt great and energized after eating their food, now I can't stop ordering it. It wasn't just a fluke, they are consistent and know what they are doing. Very healthy ingredients in their burrito bowl. I recommend this place to everyone who asks where to get good food in London."
Pita Pit (1255 Kilally Road),1,First time ordering. My pita had literally 3 tiny pieces of buffalo chicken inside!? Is that actually a joke? It was alllll lettuce and mostly the hard parts. I can't even believe they would sell that and think we wouldn't complain. Never going back. Waste of money. If you want salad. That's what you'll get .
Pita Pit (1255 Kilally Road),1,"I had my boyfriend pick up lunch for me to bring to work. When I opened it and started to eat it the whole pita cracked open and toppings fell everywhere. When I called to tell them how horrible my experience was and that I couldn‚Äôt even eat my lunch and I had the whole pita and toppings wrapped up and I would like it replaced they told me they wouldn‚Äôt replace it because all the pitas are the same and from the same supplier so there‚Äôs nothing they can do for me. I order pita pit all the time and I have NEVER had this happen to me. Almost a 15.00 pita and couldn‚Äôt even eat it so disappointed.

DO BETTER!!! I will never be returning. You‚Äôve lost my business and I will pass along to anyone who goes there."
Pita Pit (1255 Kilally Road),5,Never wrote a review for restaurant but this pita pit is one of my favourite staff is so amazing food is so good I work next to them even if I bring my lunch I crave for their chicken rice bowl
Pita Pit (1255 Kilally Road),5,"I get Pita Pit regularly but this was my first time at this location and it was the best pita I have ever had. The two girls working (sisters) were very kind, friendly and professional- even when the customer ahead of me was very clearly intoxicated. Overall a great experience!"
Student Variety,5,Great place historic diner from 1956. Only wish they had retained original vibe inside. It's clean and modern but very cute. Breakfast was served hot and fast. Bacon was great and eggs perfect.
Student Variety,5,"Introducing another perfect Brunch place located right in downtown London, ON! ‚ú®I have been wanting to try this for the 4 years of my undergrad! Their menu items are all at very reasonable prices, like egg bennies breakfast is around 13.25! ü´£Their interior also very comfortable and home-y. This time, I got..

üåØClub wrap üåØ
I have this recent craving of sandwiches and wrap so I got a chicken wrap ü§™(My fav type of protein!) It was so yummy as the combination of mayo sauce, chicken and bacon goes so well together! ü§ìThe lettuce and tomato also add a bit of freshness and cruchiness to the wrap! Totally should try this!

üçüHome fries üçü
They also serve French fries or home fries with the wrap! The difference between French fries and home fries is that frech fries are deep fried while home fries are seasoned and grilled! ü§çI got the home fries this time, it was perfect! It was so soft and perfectly seasoned, not so salty! üòÅAs I am writing this, I am craving for it! ‚ú®

‚òïÔ∏èCoffee ‚òïÔ∏è
A brunch with coffee is the best! I got their coffee this time, they allow refills as well! ü§™I saw that there was a type of coffee that they serve is pretty special, it is called Greek Iced Frappe Coffee! I didn‚Äôt get to try it this time, but will do one day!ü•∞

üçìFruit salad üçì
They also serve a lot of different types of sides like pancakes, bacon strips and fruit salad! They have two sizes of fruit salad, small and large! It is full of tropical fruits: pineapples, grapes, watermelon..etc.!üòÜ

I love this place and will definitely come back for more home fries and other food!!‚ú®
Thank you for the great hospitality and yummy food üíó"
Student Variety,5,"Went for brunch with a small group, only 4 persons and it was amazing. There were only 2 or 3 servers but we got service really promptly. Our server was so friendly too,  amazing service. Let's talk about the food. OMG, the portion size is out of their world. I got 'For the Hungry' and the leftovers served me for another day of breakfast. It tasted delicious too. Free refill on coffee is also great."
Student Variety,4,"Great Food and Portions, Awesome Diner Aesthetic, Excellent Service and Friendly Staff"
Student Variety,3,"A London breakfast staple for years and I went there for the first time with my husband and daughters (9 yrs, 4 yrs and 3 month old). Was lucky to find a table right in the corner but was a bit cramped for us. Didn't think the place was quite small so if you go, don't bring in strollers or car seats. Some of the staff could perhaps be a bit more 'cheery.' The lady who waited on us, short white hair, she was great except she was a little lacking on refilling our small coffee cups. They're busy so I understand this but it's not a big place at all. The food is not bad, not the best either. Typical breakfast fare. Not bad place overall."
Mother Hubbard's,5,"Met a good friend for lunch here today (his pick) and like every other meal we have enjoyed here it was perfect. George (the owner) is a super friendly gent who definitely cares about the quality of your dining experience. If you miss that classic diner experience of a home cooked meal then Mother Hubbard has what you need in their cupboard.
Definitely a place many return to for a consistent dining experience."
Mother Hubbard's,5,Best restaurant in London! The staff are so professional and friendly. The owner George is very kind and works incredibly hard. The food is delicious every time no matter what you order. Will definitely be back!
Mother Hubbard's,5,Amazing food. Phenomenal service. Had a great time. Would definitely go back.
Mother Hubbard's,5,My favourite place to get a comfort meal!! Everything is always fresh and made well! Great experience!!
Mother Hubbard's,5,Always a good place to go for all day breakfast!! Good price and good taste.
Buzz Bagelz,5,We went there Saturday for breakfast and Sunday for brunch  both visits were amazing the 2 different waitresses we had were great if back in London would i definitely go back  for that homemade strawberry jam..
Buzz Bagelz,5,"5 stars for excellent service, delicious food and fair prices. Pictured below, the Vegetarian Eggs Benny and Potato Latke Breakfast. Both were incredible. We also got the Club Sandwich to go with a side Greek Salad. So happy to find an amazing diner within walking distance. We‚Äôll be back!"
Buzz Bagelz,5,"Absolutely loved this place ... It's a must for anyone that can appreciate a home cooked meal followed by a delicious slice of pie.

It started with the friendly greetings when we entered this family run business. It's the perfect size to make you feel right at home.

The food was spectacular, we arrived at lunch so two of us had breakfast and the third lunch.

I don't very often hand out 5 stars... So mark this diner on your list of must visits!"
Buzz Bagelz,5,"The thing about Billy‚Äôs is that it‚Äôs perfect. It‚Äôs the perfect diner. Perfect lovely staff, very good coffee, frequent refills, hash browns OR home fries!!! They have their OWN jam and their OWN chili sauce if you like that kind of thing. There‚Äôs ALWAYS enough cream on the table. I love them! Bless Billy‚Äôs. (Oh and they their sunny side eggs are always EXACTLY right. Harder to find than you think!)"
Buzz Bagelz,2,"My husband wanted to have a nice breakfast for his birthday and we came because the place had a good review on it. The food came cold and eggs had a piece of shell in it. After waiting for a while for no reason (there were three tables nobody cleaned for a while), we had to ask to be moved inside.
The waitresses had the brilliant idea of putting little cups with honey, maple syrup and jam besides our table to attract the wasps. We couldn't chew for more than two times without waving our phones and napkins to take them out of our faces. We weren't moved inside at all - they came to offer after over 30 minutes, when we were almost done eating.
I wouldn't come back even if I could eat for free. Food is not exceptional, you can eat at other diners for the same price (better food and way better experience)."
7-Eleven (1181 Western Rd @ Sarnia),2,"Although subway was good but there is section called,‚Äùspecial instructions‚Äù that is supposed to be read. My subway was supposed to have sriracha and grilled as well. That they missed.
This was not the first time they missed my instructions it happened before. Can‚Äôt ignore it everytime. I would really appreciate if employees can read the order properly."
7-Eleven (1181 Western Rd @ Sarnia),1,Supposed to be open till 2 am. The open sign is on but the store is closed
7-Eleven (1181 Western Rd @ Sarnia),1,I was charged for an online order I didn't place. I'm in the US and don't know anyone in Ontario. I have never been to Canada. I got in contact with the owner and sent him the email for order. He tried to send my money through email but I couldn't receive it because I don't bank in Canada. This must have been too difficult for him to understand. My account has been compromised and my privacy and finances have been violated. Does Trudeau own Subway Canada?
7-Eleven (1181 Western Rd @ Sarnia),5,"Having a Splendid SUB at Friday night is such a blessing üôå üòç üôè ‚ú®
Such a sweet employee along with generous amount of topping she gave us. Definitely recommend üëå"
7-Eleven (1181 Western Rd @ Sarnia),4,"It's a Subway, no complaints. Decent value if you get the three foot-long deal for $27.49, or if you get 1/2 dozen cookies for $3.89!"
TAJ MAHAL KITCHEN & BAR,5,"This is my honest experience. My friend and I had Lamb and Mutton Biriyani today. It was scrumptious and the mint chutney was awesome too. I like the ambiance. When it comes to service, the girl was so nice, polite and respectful. The restaurant is clean and peaceful. I talked to the management during my last visit when we tried their 50-cent Samosa (worth every penny) which is commendable. I love their hospitality and will visit again soon."
TAJ MAHAL KITCHEN & BAR,4,"I got takeout for a very first time from Taj Mahal.
Their Butter Chicken was tasty, buttery and just melt in my mouth.
The Fish Curry was also good.
Their Naan, especially Garlic Naan was my favourite.

First time I tried some desserts too, maybe a little too sweet but still good in overall.

Will come back to try more different dishes."
TAJ MAHAL KITCHEN & BAR,5,"I don't know why there are so many negative reviews for this place. We ordered multiple things and everything was absolutely delicious. The food, the service and the ambience everything was outstanding. Definitely going to be one of my go-tos for authentic Indian food. I have shared some pictures of the two thalis we ordered."
TAJ MAHAL KITCHEN & BAR,5,I am a very picky eater but the food was great and very kind service. 10/10 will be back to try more things
TAJ MAHAL KITCHEN & BAR,3,"Tried their buffet today. The food was just ok.

Regarding the Main course, Goat Curry was really nice.
Butter chicken was not upto the mark.
Tandoori chicken was horrible Can‚Äôt feel any kind of masalas in that.
We ordered butter naan, Some of the Naan were freshly prepared and some were not fresh.
Salads were ok.
Expected some authentic Indian sweets as dessert but got some Tim bits as well as some muffins.

Customer service was really good.

Although an average food experience."
Family Circle Restaurant,5,"Was sad to learn that this place will be demolished for a high rise as my first time going was today (July 7, 2023).

That being said the club sandwich was just the right combo of ingredients and the fries were great! The server was very kind and positive and the place has an older yet welcoming and bright feeling.

Prices were not outrageously inflated either.

Thank you for the first and last visit!"
Family Circle Restaurant,3,"I want to rate this place higher, as I am not one to typically complain. So I'll start off positive, the restaurant was lovely inside, the servers were attentive and orders were correct. My meal was perfect. However, my husband was served a fantastic looking meal on an EXTREMELY dusty plate. Honestly disgusting. His finger was covered in thick dust when he touched his plate. He did send it back and ordered something else. Which they gracefully did, but rushed (understandably) and unfortunately wasn't fully cooked. It was a burger so he ate it anyways, as beef can be pink."
Family Circle Restaurant,1,"I had breakfast and the waiter serving us tried to be nice but clearly seemed annoyed at our presence
I don't know why, maybe it's the difference of nationalities or there is some other reason for that..
We ordered sandwiches without ham, then he said it was turkey and I wasn't sure
I felt like I was being watched, as soon as I finished one of the dishes he started running to take it away
Bring the bill before you ask him! I don't find this tactful...
I will not repeat the experience because I have never felt so comfortable"
Family Circle Restaurant,4,"Great staff. Prices are unbeatable. Quality is all there. My number one recommendation.

Cons:
Interior design is very dated and run down, especially the carpet. Handicap button in the front door doesn't work."
Family Circle Restaurant,5,"I have been to most breakfast spots in London, but for years now, Family Circle is always the first spot that comes to mind and the place I always find myself when gathering for breakfast or a late lunch. The service is absolutely incredible and if that hasn‚Äôt been someone‚Äôs experience, I would question their energy when engaging with the staff - were you kind?

And by all members of the FC team! A big shout out to Chris for always being welcoming, kind, attentive and every time (no exaggeration) he ensures the food is delivered as ordered, hot and delicious! Christina for her light and energy and Michael for always checking in regardless if he‚Äôs serving me or not! Excellent helpers. I always appreciate the chats and visits made to the booth to say hello. Never any issues when adjusting your meal or menu items either which is great. While I do not see the chef - thank you too!

FC is clean and inviting. Seating is spacious and there is bathrooms on site. TONS of parking. The coffee is yummy and they are always around with a top up. If you want great service, a mom and pop meal with a comfy spot to relax, then FC is worth it. Their prices are very fair and with inflation, the service is worth the price and a tip - they deserve it. These types of places and this type of service can be considered gold, depending on how you view things! Just go, and if you did not have a good experience the first time, go back again."
Reef Bakery,4,"Chicken tawook are great
Beef skewers are great
Breads are yummy!!!!
Hummus is good

Most kababs meh ... It's not that good, I wouldn't recommend it. Dry and hard but with flavor.
The pastrami sub was horrible. I think they forgot to cook the meat. It was very hard to finish. Don't buy.

Prices are reasonable.

There are bugs flying around like fruit flies. I think they need to take care of it ASAP before it gets out of their hands. I will recommend eating in their patio area instead of dining indoors."
Reef Bakery,3,"This restaurant is very interesting it also has grocery, butchery and lot of other merchandise. We had booked a table in advance but when we got there,they had no idea. As we were a large group we had to wait for tables to be reorganized.  Also, they ran out of dough to make bread, it was delayed . The food was otherwise good. They have a variety of fresh fish. I also the prayer room they have."
Reef Bakery,5,The food here is very tasty. I recommend trying it. It was more than wonderful food. I give it 10/10
Reef Bakery,5,"This was my first visit, and I very much enjoyed my lunch. One item I didn't get in my photo was the fresh bread I had with it which went perfectly with the hummus and the garlic. It was quite a bit of food as well (especially for a lunch) however if you are hungry you will have no problem finishing. The meat was slightly dry for me, but other than that it was excellent. I'll be returning soon to try something new. There is also a grocery store and what looked to be a bakery with pastries as well"
Reef Bakery,4,"Terrible service, but everything else made up for it.

There were 2 separate occasions were my table made a request to the employees. In both these occasions, the employee said they‚Äôd be with us in a minute but then ignored us.
Though it seems like a dine in restaurant, the service is more like fast food. You grab your own table and plates, you order at the counter, and bring it to the table yourself when it‚Äôs ready.

The food however was great. The beef and chicken were both very tender. The portion sizes were also great, and the prices were very fair.
Because of the good prices, it‚Äôs understandable why their service isn‚Äôt up to par.

Overall, I enjoyed my visit and will likely be back in the future."
Ring A Wing (Wonderland),1,Better off ordering from mcdonald‚Äôs. Nothing tasted good from here. Also no wings in my mixed platters which says on the menu for 5 wings. the fish tasted frozen and no effort put in. I would give zero star if I could. this was for $40? F.
Ring A Wing (Wonderland),1,"First of all, I wanted to give this place a try because of their availability. I wanted to check some reviews and even though I saw those really bad reviews I said let‚Äôs give this a try maybe they could do my order better! It was the worst decision I‚Äôve ever made! These guys really have to work in the amount of SAUCE they put on the wings! If you are promoting wings you should be leaving the taste of chicken to your guests not just pure sauce! It‚Äôs not fun at all! Also, on their website they promote the medium nachos with beef on top (it‚Äôs a total lie) it does not come with it. And they do not even think about calling their customer to let them know if something had changed with their order. A total bad experience! Not planning to order from this place anymore!"
Ring A Wing (Wonderland),1,"I‚Äôve gone to ring a wing for 20 years DO NOT EAT HERE. they send the wrong order, cold and soggy and this is what the guy said ‚Äúmam, it‚Äôs not my fault the driver took too long to get there‚Äù and also told me that the CAJUN DRY had sauce today and it‚Äôs my fault. I have ordered Cajun dry EVERY TIME BECAUSE I HATE SAUCE. What a TERRIBLE business it is now (hence the zillions of poor reviews)"
Ring A Wing (Wonderland),5,"Service was good, food was ok. The breading on the wings was sorta grainy, it kinda turned me off. They were cooked well though. The saving grace were the samosas, particularly the vegetable one. my goodness that thing was good, they're only a dollar each.

Edit: ask for the wings with the sauce on the side A+++. They get too soggy if it takes you a while to get home or delivered."
Ring A Wing (Wonderland),1,"Thank you for drowning my wings in sauce. I decided to give you guys another chance since the last few abominations I got but now this is the final nail to seal the coffin . Whoever was making these wings either dropped them into sauce or decided it was their last shift forever and quit on the spot and took it out on my food . My wings literally could have made a glass of water cold thats how much sauce was on put on the wings. When I picked up my container of wings I thought I was carrying a new born child that‚Äôs how heavy this thing was . Are you guys making smoothies or wings ??? Don‚Äôt ever order from ring a wing again, unless you love drinking sauce."
Springbank Minimart & Video Balloon Centre,4,"To start out, the pizza is really good. This was our second time ordering. No complaints about the pizza. It's fresh, the toppings are good and plentiful, but the free dipping sauce we got with the pizza today at lunch (cheddar) was not at all what I was expecting. It looked like shredded cheese that was partially melted, but then congealed. It was not sauce-like whatsoever. It was inedible."
Springbank Minimart & Video Balloon Centre,1,"This place has changed hands a bunch over the last couple of decades
Different owners etc
Always loyal to to the owners even though taste has definitely changed through the years
Recently the owner was so mean and rude to my spouse when he came to pick up our pizza
No reason for that
That's what you get for being a loyal customer üòî"
Springbank Minimart & Video Balloon Centre,1,"WORST PIZZA PLACE IN LONDON!!

Their food is absolutely disgusting.

The service is the worst service you can find in any restaurant.

Very rude and they treat customers like garbage.

Do not waste your money at this pizza place."
Springbank Minimart & Video Balloon Centre,3,"Super Six is okay pizza for a good price. It might be the good price that makes it taste better.
It‚Äôs not the best pizza you‚Äôll have and the sides (wings, garlic bread etc) could use some work as they‚Äôre leaps and bounds behind the pizza. The staff are friendly, the place is typically clean.

If you‚Äôre looking to order for a party of people, I would recommend super six as the price to quality ratio is typically better than a lot of ‚Äú2 for 1‚Äù places."
Springbank Minimart & Video Balloon Centre,4,"First time ordered from them and it was amazing. Cheap for a big meal.
Just disappointed with the delivery driver.he is not police and yelling on the phone."
Mike's Pizza & Donair (Oakville Ave),2,Tasty after I cut the top off my panzerotti and spread the toppings out the pepperoni and mushrooms so I could enjoy them in every bite mushrooms were piled in the middle and the pepperoni on the outside edge but with the toppings piled up and not  spread out it was easy to remove most the olives that I didn't order wasn't going to drive the 20 miles back to town to return probably won't eat there again
Mike's Pizza & Donair (Oakville Ave),4,"Very good Donair. Fast service. Prices of course have gone up like everywhere else. Chatted with the owner about the origin of the restaurant coming from Lunenburg NS. Easygoing east-coaster, as most are. üòÄ"
Mike's Pizza & Donair (Oakville Ave),5,"Listen, if you like cheese the pizza will be your best friend. The donair was amazing, but the pizza sub and donair sub is the best I‚Äôve tried. Definitely recommend"
Mike's Pizza & Donair (Oakville Ave),1,"Ordered pizza tonight, I pre-ordered to have it delivered at a specific time. It was over an hour late. When it finally did arrive we were missing half our $60  order, and the pizza was burnt!!!! I called the store to make a complaint and ask for a refund.."
Mike's Pizza & Donair (Oakville Ave),5,Delicious pizza.  Crust has great flavour and the cheese is of great quality.   They place cheese as the last topping so if you like your toppings on top make sure to specify it.  Next to Ricco's pizza this is the best pizza in eastern London and a great value.  They pour on the cheese.  No skimping on toppings.  Their wings are also amazing
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (1030 Adelaide St N Unit #8),5,"The salted caramel banana Belgian waffle is amazing! I could barely make it through half way (fitted shirt that day), but 200% worth the taste"
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (1030 Adelaide St N Unit #8),5,Gluten free crepes!!!!! Thank you for an amazing experience. I love your gluten free options and going checking in with me to make sure gluten free protocol was followed! I have an amazing meal and experience.
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (1030 Adelaide St N Unit #8),4,"Ordered the Cora Special and Eggs Benedict with spinach + mushrooms for breakfast today and is was delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly and portions were plentiful. I only ate half of my food and was already full so my partner had a really great time having a second breakfast üòÖ

My server gave me the wrong tea but was kind enough to bring me the right one. It took longer than we thought for the food to arrive because we ordered when there weren‚Äôt much people in the restaurant however I will definitely recommend this place and come back to try their other items!!"
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (1030 Adelaide St N Unit #8),5,"It was my first time in this establishment in London. I was meeting a friend for breakfast and I ordered 10 start omelette.
Omelette was fully loaded with a lot of items like ham, spinach, fried onions, mushroom, sausage etc topped with cheese and side of 2 butter bread of your choice. It also came with a piece of cantaloupe, pineapple and a strawberry which was nice.
Coffee re-fill was also available with no additional price and since I like my black coffee with breakfast so it was kind of amazing :)
Service was great and our server was kind enough to bring our food early than expected in that rush hour.
I would definitely recommend this place and would visit again for sure :)"
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (1030 Adelaide St N Unit #8),5,"Sima was a fantastic server!  Super sweet, patient, and kind while serving our table of 8. She returned to the table several times to check that we had everything we needed. All the food was served by a team of servers to ensure we all got our meals at the same time. Another employee came by the table to inquire how our service was and thanked us for choosing Cora's.  I was impressed with the amount of attentiveness we received, despite it being an incredibly busy time, with an obvious line up out the door. Well done Team Cora's! and Happy Mother's Day! üòä"
Campus Hi-Fi,5,Great place historic diner from 1956. Only wish they had retained original vibe inside. It's clean and modern but very cute. Breakfast was served hot and fast. Bacon was great and eggs perfect.
Campus Hi-Fi,5,"Introducing another perfect Brunch place located right in downtown London, ON! ‚ú®I have been wanting to try this for the 4 years of my undergrad! Their menu items are all at very reasonable prices, like egg bennies breakfast is around 13.25! ü´£Their interior also very comfortable and home-y. This time, I got..

üåØClub wrap üåØ
I have this recent craving of sandwiches and wrap so I got a chicken wrap ü§™(My fav type of protein!) It was so yummy as the combination of mayo sauce, chicken and bacon goes so well together! ü§ìThe lettuce and tomato also add a bit of freshness and cruchiness to the wrap! Totally should try this!

üçüHome fries üçü
They also serve French fries or home fries with the wrap! The difference between French fries and home fries is that frech fries are deep fried while home fries are seasoned and grilled! ü§çI got the home fries this time, it was perfect! It was so soft and perfectly seasoned, not so salty! üòÅAs I am writing this, I am craving for it! ‚ú®

‚òïÔ∏èCoffee ‚òïÔ∏è
A brunch with coffee is the best! I got their coffee this time, they allow refills as well! ü§™I saw that there was a type of coffee that they serve is pretty special, it is called Greek Iced Frappe Coffee! I didn‚Äôt get to try it this time, but will do one day!ü•∞

üçìFruit salad üçì
They also serve a lot of different types of sides like pancakes, bacon strips and fruit salad! They have two sizes of fruit salad, small and large! It is full of tropical fruits: pineapples, grapes, watermelon..etc.!üòÜ

I love this place and will definitely come back for more home fries and other food!!‚ú®
Thank you for the great hospitality and yummy food üíó"
Campus Hi-Fi,5,"Went for brunch with a small group, only 4 persons and it was amazing. There were only 2 or 3 servers but we got service really promptly. Our server was so friendly too,  amazing service. Let's talk about the food. OMG, the portion size is out of their world. I got 'For the Hungry' and the leftovers served me for another day of breakfast. It tasted delicious too. Free refill on coffee is also great."
Campus Hi-Fi,4,"Great Food and Portions, Awesome Diner Aesthetic, Excellent Service and Friendly Staff"
Campus Hi-Fi,3,"A London breakfast staple for years and I went there for the first time with my husband and daughters (9 yrs, 4 yrs and 3 month old). Was lucky to find a table right in the corner but was a bit cramped for us. Didn't think the place was quite small so if you go, don't bring in strollers or car seats. Some of the staff could perhaps be a bit more 'cheery.' The lady who waited on us, short white hair, she was great except she was a little lacking on refilling our small coffee cups. They're busy so I understand this but it's not a big place at all. The food is not bad, not the best either. Typical breakfast fare. Not bad place overall."
La Parrillada Grill and Latin Cuisine,5,"Easily the best Latin American place in London and one of the best restaurants in the whole city. A must try for anyone in the area. The service was incredible, my party had the pleasure of meeting the friendliest gentlemen that continuously checked up on us and made us feel welcome. The atmosphere is great and the food is so tasty, I couldn‚Äôt stop eating. Will definitely be coming back again more than once! Absolutely incredible place."
La Parrillada Grill and Latin Cuisine,5,"Unreal, I ate waaaaay too much and I regret nothing. Just a fantastic place to drop in and have a meal. Definitely adding this to the top tier takeout list also. Can't say enough good things. Everything was perfectly cooked, really lively flavours and a great atmosphere."
La Parrillada Grill and Latin Cuisine,5,"Lovely restaurant. It was nice to have a taste of South American cooking beyond the usual bastardized mexican food. We had the carne asada and the . I loved the sausages, the sides, and the sauces. As a lover of barely cooked meat, the grilled pieces were a bit less satisfying, yet far from bad. Overall I was quite happy with my plate. And the amount of food was more than enough.
The restaurant itself looks nice but still a bit unfinished. The background music was nice. But I was really impressed with the great service.
Go there and enjoy!"
La Parrillada Grill and Latin Cuisine,5,"Have been to La Parrillada, and I can't say enough good things. Service is great! We've had several different dishes and never disappointed. All ingredients are fresh, and flavour is on point. Deliciousness. Very recommended!!! The picture is of the Pollo Asado dish"
La Parrillada Grill and Latin Cuisine,5,"Wowza!  We went here for lunch and had an amazing meal, coming away with leftovers, just like everyone else I watched leaving. Food was delicious, authentic and plentiful. When I say authentic I mean it - my wife is Venezuelan and my friend visiting lives in Brownsville, Texas (his work territory is all of Latin America). Even he was impressed with it all the way up here in Canada. The staff were very polite, friendly and happy which means the food is made with love. Highly recommend. Can't believe it took us so long to stop in for a bite considering we live less than 5 minutes away."
Angel's Family Restaurant,5,"Good Diner Food. The Baked Mac and Cheese was great, as was the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. The kids enjoyed the kid's menu. Coffee was better than average. Friendly service. I was hoping for an all day breakfast option, but I enjoyed the Dinner menu enough I'll be back to try the breakfast menu."
Angel's Family Restaurant,5,"This is the second time I've been to Angel's Diner...and the second time ordering the same dish....why you ask, because, Angel's has the best burger I have ever had!!!!  And I know burgers.
My companion and myself both decided on the burgers on our last visit. Mine being the Lumberjack with fries and gravy. Gravy is the kind that only a great burger joint would have. And my companion had the Greek Burger with a side Caesar salad.
If you want a delicious 1/2 pound homestyle burger....please take my word and give Angel's Diner a try.
Maybe some day I'll try the rest of the menu because the food at the surrounding tables looked just as tasty and appetizing as our burgers."
Angel's Family Restaurant,5,"Even thou there was a bit of a waiting queue, the service was great, very friendly. The food didn‚Äôt take long to be served, was plentiful, well prepared, flavoured. Will always come back when in the region."
Angel's Family Restaurant,5,Food was amazing üëè.  Service was terrific.  We came upon this place by fluke. I have nothing but good things to say
Angel's Family Restaurant,5,Had a spinach 3 cheese chicken omelette was amazing rye bread and gravy‚Ä¶ I will be returning the server was so nice and welcoming food was good and fast .. great experience‚Ä¶
IHOP (Oxford St),3,"Its kinda funny how once in a while you come across some business just operating completely unlike the rest.  Like Arbys in fast food  or Saab cars in the day or even Tesla now.

What im saying is people eventually always create these super unique businesses completely unlike the rest.

The idea of a ghost kitchen is great ‚úÖ

Conveinience off all those separate items in one location ‚úÖ

But making all those menu items in one location must be fairly difficult. You can only suspect that there are either 8 people in the back standing there waiting for orders or 1 dude that runs around to each station. Lol

This is probably why you'll wait so much longer then you think you should. ‚è∞

But... Eventually I feel this will be the way we order food. üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I can only imagine that humans in 50s years will be surrounded by  ""Ghost Kitchens"" type restaurants. My fear is that our taste buds will pay the price for these Ghost Kitchens ""conveinience""."
IHOP (Oxford St),1,"I now understand the concept of ghost kitchen. There is nobody here. The place is empty and deserted. With only the occasional opening of a fridge or freezer door, there is no signs of life. Even when asking about an order once I saw someone finally helping a delivery person, they were completely confused and lost. They went to get help and clearly got lost in the maze of whatever is hiding behind the white swinging doors. This will be the last time I ever come to this particular location and if this is any indication of other ghost kitchens, I will definitely not going to those either. This is a very poor representation of this brand and the brands they carry.
Edited (for a sense of closure):
Well ‚Ä¶ once the order was found 45 minutes after the initial order was submitted, I came home only to find the burgers burnt and grotesquely crispy, the grilled cheese ice cold, and the chicken burger was soggy. We ate what we could which very little. The only silver lining here was that the dog had fun tearing the paper bag apart. Needless to say, that was one expensive paper bag for the dog to play with."
IHOP (Oxford St),4,The staff really are very friendly. The options are huge. We tried Mr. Beast Burger. Our expectations where not high. The burgers where  smash burgers and where delicious. The cheese on the grilled cheese wasn't melted but the restaurant knows and is correcting that. The chicken was fine. Its made with chicken tenders and is what it is. It's not the cheapest place to dine. You pay for the restaurant brands.
IHOP (Oxford St),3,Great concept.  They only accept digital payment.  They should allow cash payment.  Most of the food was ok. Burgers are great.  Fries are the worst fries I have ever had anywhere.  Some tweaks would make it a lot better place.
IHOP (Oxford St),1,"Good concept - but when I ordered their three cheese pierogies off Uber eats, my food arrived cold and with moldy cheese in it. Wouldn't recommend"
The Breakfast Griddle,5,"My husband and I go to Mary's Place about every two weeks and have done so for about a year.  We have tried other breakfast restaurants and like Mary's Place the best.  I like a BLT and have certain standards that I like to be met, such as:  Crispy bacon that isn't greasy, a nice fresh tomato and crispy lettuce, all in a neat sandwich.  Mary's Place does this perfectly in my opinion.  The coffee is tasty also.  The waitresses are attentive and friendly.  They try to get to your table as soon as you sit down and ask for your beverage order.  The food, once ordered comes in a timely manner.  Hubby likes their Toasted Western with Home Fries.  We get the same orders each time we go.  We also like the homey atmosphere and it's not noisy or hectic like some places, even if all the tables are full."
The Breakfast Griddle,5,Ordered breakfast through Sikp the Dishes. Food was so good and the portion sizes are great. Recommended with five stars.
The Breakfast Griddle,5,Nothing fancy but definitely delicious - we especially loved how loaded the pancakes were with blueberries. Highly recommend!
The Breakfast Griddle,5,"Orderes for delivery. Good pricing, well packaged, was still hot and tasted great!"
The Breakfast Griddle,5,"In my opinion, the best breakfast and lunch take out in the area."
BUTTERBITES Cafe and Restaurant,5,"Amazing place to dine.  Service was fast, friendly and efficient.  Very clean too.  The food was delicious.  All fresh and still hot.  Prices were great.  Can't wait to try more from their menu!  Well done Butterbites!"
BUTTERBITES Cafe and Restaurant,5,"The breakfast sausages here are ü§§. The ultimate platter would have been enough to feed 2 adults and 1 toddler, but my pregnant self was craving for a good Belgian waffle, so we ended up with leftovers. No regrets though as the Belgian waffle was spot-on and had a lot of fruits. Our toddler was also a bit hangry when we arrived, but our server was so polite and accommodating üôè. Would definitely come back here if we ever visit London again."
BUTTERBITES Cafe and Restaurant,5,"Great experience!

From the moment you walk in until you leave Stuffed, the staff was incredible.  The greeter and server was attentive to our needs, checked on us often and made sure we had all we needed to enjoy our meal.  The chef even asked us how the food was, GREAT was our answer!

It was our first time trying the French toast, which I highly recommend,  and I spotted someone else getting chicken and so will definitely going back to try more off the menu.

Give it a try, guaranteed you won't be disappointed."
BUTTERBITES Cafe and Restaurant,4,"Food - 5/5
Service - 4/5
Ambiance - 4/5
Price - Nominal
Overall - 4/5

It's definitely worth a visit. I was travelling to windsor, and thought of taking a stop here for breakfast, and it was a great decision. The food was so good and filling. They also provide omelette with just egg whites, and by far the best I've seen. The pancakes were amazing too. The bennies, breads, coffee, everything was great. Must visit if in town!"
BUTTERBITES Cafe and Restaurant,5,"First time going over all great atmosphere, clean lots of space.
The food overall was great, I just wish they used less parsley on their homefries. I took a bite and had a mouth full, unfortunately.
Everything else was over the top perfect. Great customer service. Will definitely be back !"
Joe's Bros Pizza,4,Was a bit shocked by the price! My son wanted garlic sauce on his pizza. Tried my regulars and they were out or didn‚Äôt do it. Ordered two Chicago style and one regular pizzas. Dipping sauces were good ( my son loved them!) the pizza was very good! Order less than you think you need!! Good! Garlic mushroom spinach Chicago style should be a thing!!
Joe's Bros Pizza,5,Our favourite pizza place in town. Have ordered 15+ times over the years and have loved it every time. We also ordered a beef shawarma but it was gobbled up before I could take a pic. üòç Pictured here are their Joe Bros specialty pizza(it was to die for); a bacon cheese garlic bread and a pic to show their crispy fries‚ù§Ô∏è
Joe's Bros Pizza,5,"Tried their slice deal (two large slices and a can of pop). I normally avoid judging a pizza joint by their slices as they're rarely fresh and not a fair metric for what their fresh, full pizzas would be like - but I was hungry and in a hurry and I turned out very pleasantly surprised. The slices are definitely generous in size with great toppings. Despite the fact it was probably made a couple hours before I got there, it was still very good. Was a fair price too. Definitely will be ordering fresh pizzas from here and drop in for slices sometimes as well."
Joe's Bros Pizza,5,"This is our go-to place for pizza in London. The pizza is truly delicious! Cheesy, melt in your mouth with a little kick in the pizza sauce. They do not skimp on toppings and the crust is toothsome. Sincerely miss this pizza when we are out of town."
Joe's Bros Pizza,5,This is some of the best pizza we have ever had. Even my hubby agreed and he is very particular about pizza. Absolutely delicious. Loaded with flavour and lots of cheese.

Even when asking about an order once I saw someone finally helping a delivery person, they were completely confused and lost. They went to get help and clearly got lost in the maze of whatever is hiding behind the white swinging doors. This will be the last time I ever come to this particular location and if this is any indication of other ghost kitchens, I will definitely not going to those either. This is a very poor representation of this brand and the brands they carry.
Edited (for a sense of closure):
Well ‚Ä¶ once the order was found 45 minutes after the initial order was submitted, I came home only to find the burgers burnt and grotesquely crispy, the grilled cheese ice cold, and the chicken burger was soggy. We ate what we could which very little. The only silver lining here was that the dog had fun tearing the paper bag apart. Needless to say, that was one expensive paper bag for the dog to play with."
Cinnabon (Oxford St),4,The staff really are very friendly. The options are huge. We tried Mr. Beast Burger. Our expectations where not high. The burgers where  smash burgers and where delicious. The cheese on the grilled cheese wasn't melted but the restaurant knows and is correcting that. The chicken was fine. Its made with chicken tenders and is what it is. It's not the cheapest place to dine. You pay for the restaurant brands.
Cinnabon (Oxford St),3,Great concept.  They only accept digital payment.  They should allow cash payment.  Most of the food was ok. Burgers are great.  Fries are the worst fries I have ever had anywhere.  Some tweaks would make it a lot better place.
Cinnabon (Oxford St),1,"Good concept - but when I ordered their three cheese pierogies off Uber eats, my food arrived cold and with moldy cheese in it. Wouldn't recommend"
Denny's Canada (3700 Highbury Ave South),4,"Restaurant was one of the only places open after our drive to London.

The good:  The restaurant is clean, and the staff is attentive. The food was good, standard diner cuisine. I had eggs, bacon, sausage and pancakes. The pancakes were good, and the eggs and sausages were good.

The bad: My brother in laws spoon was dirty/stained. My bacon was a tad overcooked.

Overall... Good"
Denny's Canada (3700 Highbury Ave South),3,The food is alright but there's comfort in standard all day breakfast fare. Service was efficient and the waitresses were lovely. The hashbrowns are never as good as they look in the pictures but the pancakes are always fluffy and delicious. The milkshakes are great too.
Denny's Canada (3700 Highbury Ave South),1,"The service level is above and beyond, no complaints there. (My server really tired her best.)

The food however, was the absolute worst.
I regret wasting $90 for food I couldn‚Äôt eat.
A few items were ordered and they all seem to came out problematic.

My Nashville Chicken Melt was over toasted, very hard to bite into.
My fries were COLD and SOGGY, it was like eating cardboard. (I am 100% sure it was just sitting there for a long time.)

One of my other meal came with burnt onion rings. It was noticeable over done. This upset me the most. The back of house should have made the call to re-make it and not wait until it reaches the table only for me to demonstrate to my server how ‚Äúnon-edible‚Äù it was. (The re-make was golden, but ended up going to waste. Dinner almost over.)

I am very disappointed. I do not recommend and I will not be visiting this particular location again."
Denny's Canada (3700 Highbury Ave South),4,"Sonia was an excellent server. Polite, friendly and attentive. She was cheery and made sure everything was to my liking. The food was good. I got the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and mixed veg. The mixed veg was basically just zucchini and one piece of broccoli, so not exactly what i would consider 'mixed'. Hence the one star off. Everything was cooked really well. The chicken wasn't dry like at some places. The strawberry smoothie was really good as well. I'll definitely be back."
Denny's Canada (3700 Highbury Ave South),4,"The waitress Rebecca was very nice. We paid $41 for 2 plates of breakfast  and 2 drinks at dinner time ( 2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 toast and hash browns).. the price was definitely not worth what we received. The toast is drenched in butter so ask for the butter on the side of you don't like that.  The place was clean and waitress was nice. Maybe breakfast is cheaper and more worth it in the morning. If I had to pick between the on route and this Denny's I would definitely come here for the cleanliness."
Mylos Grill,3,Newly renovated and new ownership during the pandemic. Mylo's Grill anchors the Holiday Inn on Wellington Street in London near the 401. Great variety in breakfast choices though no oatmeal. Very limited in service.  Everytime I've been here there's only one person working.
Mylos Grill,1,"Wife to me out for my 60th birthday breakfast. I told her let‚Äôs try mylo‚Äôs, What a mistake Horrible breakfast sausage and bacon dried out looks and tasted like it was reheated several time‚Äôs.. Home fries full of salt .. I ate only eggs on the plate ..Wife same told the owner We were Don eating this, explained why we where not eating the rest‚Ä¶ He said he was going to knock 50% off bill so all in all it cost $25, for  2 horrible, tasting coffee‚Äôs and 2 eggs each.. will never eat there again"
Mylos Grill,2,Food was just ok... overall thr pkace was not very clean. While esting we had several flies and insects around our table. Windows were dirty and tqbkes were not very clean.  Overall not a place to try (at least not for my family and I)
Mylos Grill,5,"Got the breakfast pizza with bacon, chicken, and sausage. The hollandaise was quite nice. Felt weirdly bare inside. Will probably go back."
Mylos Grill,1,"My wife ordered fish and chips and I ordered Philly cheese steak on a bun.
When the food arrived our fries were over cooked, hard and tasted like the oil was burnt. My wifes fish was overcooked and the fish inside was not fresh, slimy looking and looked like it had been reheated. The beef on my sandwich was dry and overcooked.
We paid for the pops we drank waiting for our awful dinner and we walked out. Can‚Äôt believe that the waiter would even bring food that looked that awful to the table!"
Pastry Culture,5,OMG. At random we picked up a loaf of the BEST bread ever at Pastry Culture. Better than bakeries in Paris. We also bought some cookies and they were great. Pastry Culture is located in Covent Garden Market just off King Street entrance. Highly recommended.
Pastry Culture,5,"Visited this lovely patisserie shop today after driving for almost 200 km. Great selection of french sweet delicacies such as canneles, eclairs, creme brulee, opera torte, Paris brest, croissants and much more. From savory  selection we tried a Quiche Lorraine and the Flamiche which resembles a pizza blanche which is made with white creme fraiche as based topping combined with leeks, pancetta, eggs and Gruyere cheese.  Also, we couldn't resist sweets, had a raspberry eclair and a slice of opera torte.
Everything was delicious. Service was excellent!"
Pastry Culture,5,"I called them for a last minute birthday cake order, and the lady was so kind. They prepared a fraisier for me in less than two hours and It was absolutely delicious. Would recommend this bakery and I will definitely come back to try all the other products."
Pastry Culture,5,"10/10 ! Absolutely delicious desserts. Staff is very friendly and kind. Always look forward to my next visit! Here I got the chocolate eclair, lemon tart and the fruit tart.
‚Ä¢UPDATE‚Ä¢ The BEST Cr√®me Brul√©e I have ever tasted. Worth every dollar!"
Pastry Culture,5,"Bought one of each to taste for the first time: madeleine, rhum and almond puff, dark chocolate eclair, pistachio brownie, truffle cake and pear tart. I was blown away by their textures (crispy and silky smooth as required), and their freshness (I could savour each ingredient). All the flavours were perfectly balanced, worth every penny. I‚Äôll be returning soon for more!!"
Smiley's Pizzeria,5,"My first visit to this place, ordered Large Pizza with Cheese sticks. Quality is great taste. Will revisit again. It would be great if we can have some done in place. Takeout and delivery."
Smiley's Pizzeria,5,"This is quickly becoming my favourite pizza. They have great deals, the food is always hot and fresh and it's so nice that it's right within the Northridge neighborhood"
Smiley's Pizzeria,5,"Quick style pizza, but this place is quality. First off the dough is hand stretched. The toppings were fresh. The sauce had a nice gentle sweetness to it. The pie was well made. If you're hunting for a new cheap pizza place: this one should be on your list.

Also: The wings were much bigger than most places. Seasoned well. Perfectly cooked.

Kudos Smileys. I'm going to be a returning customer."
Smiley's Pizzeria,4,"Overall, I really like this place and would recommend. I really enjoy the panzerotti and wings. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is last time they gave me burnt wings. I don't mean a nice little char, I mean dry crunchy black parts and otherwise burnt in general. I don't know how they let that go out the door. Don't give your customers anything you wouldn't eat yourself! Seems like a one off bad experience, though. Enjoyed all other times."
Smiley's Pizzeria,1,2 hours late on delivery. Would not even give a discount or for free. No one can seem to find where there delivery driver goes. And I had to get my own food. Deffently do not recommend. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL
Pinto‚Äôs Convenience,5,"Delicious Portuguese food, amazing coffee, friendly staff. No menus but all heart! Thanks to Luis for showing me this place."
Pinto‚Äôs Convenience,4,Delicious! We ordered a whole chicken and piripiri rice.  It was the first time visit for us.  The hostess was lovely and the food was amazing. I would recommend.
Pinto‚Äôs Convenience,5,"Great authentic Portugese restaurant, with the friendliest service, and home cooked feel.  Have been there a few times and the chef always comes out to talk to our table and ensure we are enjoying ourselves (which we always are of course)."
Pinto‚Äôs Convenience,5,Our go to spot in London for an authentic taste of Portugal.  Call and order the grilled chicken ahead as it's strictly made to order.
Pinto‚Äôs Convenience,5,"I have dreams of their piri piri sauce. Delicious food, great service. Friendly atmosphere."
Walmart (330 Clarke Rd),4,"Everything here is fine. The store is clean, looks to be relatively newly renovated or well maintained. The food is good and consistent. Added bonus is the children's play place!
The only downside worth a mention, is that I find the service rather slow."
Walmart (330 Clarke Rd),5,"Easily the best McDonald's breakfast I've had in over a decade. Hot, fresh, fast service at 5:30am. No one else was in the restaurant & everything was of the extreme satisfaction 5/5."
Walmart (330 Clarke Rd),3,"The staff was nice. But it seems like someone lives in the ladies washroom. Lots of dirty laundry, hangers and a randome shoe. Kinda sketch for a washroom with controlled entry"
Walmart (330 Clarke Rd),1,"It was a terrible experience and I will not return.  The tables were filthy and they did not get the order correct. The playland had older children tearing around playing tag knocking over small children.  Three adults spoke to the manager and nothing was done. When I spoke to the manager regarding the issues she simply stated ""thanks, have a good day"". She may as well said ""forget you""."
Walmart (330 Clarke Rd),5,Coffee very good  stickers ending  in August  no more coffee  stickers  for free coffee  after the 8th  stickers  in done  so   get your free coffee  sticker done
COBS Bread (London North West),5,"Love this bakery,  staff are very friendly and kind and it is such a great atmosphere. So many great products. Love the chocolate croissants, jalape√±o cheese twist and of course the scones!!"
COBS Bread (London North West),4,"One of the best places to get some fresh baked bread. Every time I've been there the staff was super friendly and helpful with our order. I recommend to try something new every time but my favourite is the rounded cheese bread.
They also have a reward program that it isn't the best but you can get a free scone in your birthday and some discount after collecting points"
COBS Bread (London North West),2,"So after my first rating it's likely I will not return but that does not stop us from noticing things as we drive by. Today while picking up someone at the mall we observed some staff on break cuddling a kitten.
The so called pull apart cheese bread was a total waste of $7.00. It was 3/4 hollow and the end that was not could not be cut even with my special bread knife.  I will give the store 2 stars as the staff were nice but due to limited space there is no time to browse for a new customer."
COBS Bread (London North West),5,First time there. Was amazing. The gentleman at the counter (Stuart I think maybe) was super friendly. Told us the deals they had on. Informed us about the app and gave us a card with info on it in the case we have technical difficulties. Great kid. He threw in an extra hot cross bun with our order. It's 12 hours later and I'm still thinking about it. Really made my day. Will be back again
COBS Bread (London North West),4,"Fresh bread and rolls and GOODIES! What's not to love!? Fresh bread, baked on premises, great selection AND you have the option of getting it sliced. So goodüòã"
Cedar North Restaurant,5,"Service was great, prices are reasonable and the food is amazing. Their kibbeh is to die for! The seasoning was delicious, texture and freshness on point.
At the end, we still got a courtesy side of garlic potatoes and they were delicious.
Will come back for sure!"
Cedar North Restaurant,5,"There were 8 of us celebrating a birthday. The food was so delicious. The owner went above and beyond by sending a fruit platter for the birthday for free. He played happy birthday over the speaker and the birthday girl had a very tasty desert.
This gem of a restaurant went beyond my expectations and we will definitely be back."
Cedar North Restaurant,5,"Great Lebanese food. The shawarma, cedar bowl and the kibbeh were amazing. The staff was super friendly and gave us a sample of potatoes with garlic sauce.
I do recommend this place!"
Cedar North Restaurant,5,"Probably the best Lebanese cuisine I‚Äôve had in a very long time!

We came for dinner and had a special drink called jallab which is made from dates. Right off the bat, that was the best jallab I‚Äôve ever tried. We had a full platter of rice, fresh pita, fattoush and tabouli salads, skewered kafta, chicken tawouk, and beef (tenderloin I think). All the proteins melted in my mouth. The fries were perfectly cooked and lightly seasoned.

You can tell that the chef doesn‚Äôt cut any corners with the food. Everything is a 10/10.

The entire restaurant is super clean and well-lit. Seating is spacious and comfortable. I would have taken more photos but I got carried away by the food.

Overall, highly recommended!"
Cedar North Restaurant,5,"Service was prompt and great. The staff were also friendly. The food was delicious and filling as well. If you're looking for a taste of the Mediterranean cuisine, then this is your go to place. Highly recommend!"
Tea Point,5,"I‚Äôve been taking their weekly food service for a long time now and it is worth every penny. Both the quality and quantity of food is just perfect. It helps me to save the time I spend in kitchen especially during busy and study weeks. Above all, I like to thank Mr Rajesh who coordinate so well and deliver the food on time right at my workplace or home. Keep doing the good service!"
Tea Point,5,Just tried punugulu and it‚Äôs surprisingly delicious. Good quantity and they served it  with coconut and tomato (Spicy) chutney. Will definitely try again soon.
Tea Point,5,"Wowowow!! Amazing potato smash burger + Peri Peri fries. Delightfully surprised with the taste and quality.

Love it and will be reordering next time I am hungry!"
Tea Point,5,"Very good tea and poutin. The staff with the glasses was super cute and helpful.
Do visit when you are in London."
Tea Point,5,"Delicious waffle dosa, Must try !"
The Knotty Pine Restaurant,4,"Would have been 5 stars if my home fries were fresh. Tasted reheated and luke warm. Eggs over done. Close but no cigar. The other 3 at our table, we're happy. $35 for 2 breakfasts should be top notch"
The Knotty Pine Restaurant,1,"Very poor customer service!! We used to eat here for the past 15 years, but over the past few years under new management the place has taken a dive. Today we walked in and sat ourselves, after waiting for 15-20 min at least,  we had to get up and go and ask for a menu. We waited for them to finally waddle over to our table to ask for our order and she doesn‚Äôt ask if we want anything to drink? We asked for water, and sat there and watched for another 15 min while the waitresses sat up front talking and not doing their job! Customers should be your priority.. we ended up walking out and won‚Äôt be coming back!"
The Knotty Pine Restaurant,3,Washrooms should be stocked every morning and maintained. Going into a washroom that has no toilet is absurd. Would not likely visit this eatery ever again.
The Knotty Pine Restaurant,5,"Food was just okay I had fish n chips - fish was breaded and from frozen chips were good for frozen fries. Partner had chicken noodle soup which was not very good mostly fat elbow noodles, a salad with chicken he said it was just okay. Coffee was unlimited and excellent. Service was really really good about the best I have ever had  I tipped 25% based only on the service. Place was clean and well lit. Menu was breakfast and lunch they close at 3pm. I will go again just because of the service."
The Knotty Pine Restaurant,5,"Great food options, priced reasonably and great coffee!!!  Lots of free parking.  Friendly staff!  Highly recommend!"
The Chopped Leaf (1041 Wellington Road) - London,5,"This place is a better version of Freshi.
Their food is more delicious than Freshi.
Falafels and tofu were great. Brown rice recipe is very flavorful
Staff is friendly
Ask to get bowl tossed in the dressing. Tastes better"
The Chopped Leaf (1041 Wellington Road) - London,4,"Looking for a healthy option in the White Oaks area and I found it.
This was my first time here and even hearing about this QSR.

What I ordered:

1 x Southwest w/ Chicken
1 x Chopped Water

What I liked:

‚úÖ Generous Portion Size (see photo)
‚úÖ Service - the service today was üîù notch. I saw a few people get served while I dined and the service was consistently friendly.
‚úÖ Recommendations- it was my first time there and they provided a great recommendation and made the experience easy.
‚úÖ Bowls - it may seem like something small but they are using real ceramic bowls. Cuts down on waste, better presentation and all that.

‚úÖSome Fresh ingredients - see for yourself.

‚úÖ Decor - clean and modern interior. Booth seating as well as cafe tables. High chair for kids is major üîë. Very thoughtful!

What could‚Äôve been better:

‚ùå No Seasoning - the chicken had no seasoning. Bland in flavour and dry.

‚ùå Pre Shedded Cheddar - the cheddar seemed pre shredded and lacked flavour.

Overall I would return and try another menu item. The service alone as enough for that!! üíØ"
The Chopped Leaf (1041 Wellington Road) - London,5,"Tasty, delicious, healthy food! We visited on Canada Day, The staff is very friendly and her service is excellent!
Definitely recommend!"
The Chopped Leaf (1041 Wellington Road) - London,4,Salad ingredients are fresh and tasty but the chicken is certainly low grade which weakens the dish.  Great portion sizes. Love the chopped infused water and gluten free cookies.
The Chopped Leaf (1041 Wellington Road) - London,5,"Brought friends for a relaxed lunch. They hadn‚Äôt been. All thought is was fresh and tasty!

Had a delicious wrap although I had bowl envy when I saw them look so good! Love the presentation of salads.

Always a friendly welcome and food delicious. As a sandwich-lunch guy, salads would seem to be a bit simple ‚Ä¶ but the Chopped Leaf crew have made me a regular. So yummy ü§§"
Chez Leon Breads,5,"I came with my teenage son and teenage daughter on a Saturday night. We came about half an hour before the live music, and we were glad that would cost the last bit of it.

We took advantage of the happy hour menu.  Everything tasted very good and I especially loved my margaritas.  Can't go wrong for the classic margarita.

Will definitely come but probably a little bit earlier this time to catch more of the live music."
Chez Leon Breads,5,"Excellent experience at ironwood last night. Lovely live music, absolutely delicious creative food that supports local all with great service and a simple but classic atmosphere. We tried 6 dishes , adopting their sharable recommendation. perch ceviche, fried chicken & corn and oysters to start. Then steak, salmon and a plate of perch for mains. Finished with their Beignets. All with a bottle of wine And a couple of well executed cocktails. It was pretty perfect. Highly recommend. We will return for sure."
Chez Leon Breads,5,Came here for lunch and had a fantastic experience!! I had the platter of fish and my wife had the soup and salad. Both were delicious. Inside is wonderfully lit with hanging Edison lights for great ambiance. At our table we could watch the chef prepare our meals. Lots of local ingredients on the menu
Chez Leon Breads,5,"A great place for a special occasion.  They were able to put together a table for us to seat 13. The atmosphere was a really nice modern/fancy decor. The music wasn't too loud, which matters for our hearing-impaired family.  The dishes where unique and elevated, with delisous sauces. There was something that everyone in our group could choose from our vegi/pescitarians to our steak lovers.  All were satisfied. Thank you! (Pictues of lamb and salmon)"
Chez Leon Breads,5,"We had a great dinner!

We started with the Cauliflower Au Gratin, Oysters & Ceviche and it was delicious.  Ceviche is a must try, the blend of flavour with a tinge of spice was delicious.

My husband had the burger & fries but with lettuce instead of bun. My son had the steak & I had the jerk chicken. It was delicious.

They had a non-alcoholic pineapple smash and it was delish!!

The restaurant was inviting and clean.
The food was amazing!!  The prize was fair.  You have to try it to understand what I‚Äôm talking about üôÇ!"
Tim Hortons (1384 Wellington Rd),5,"I had breakfast 3 days in a row in this exact location and here are my thoughts: They were very consistent in terms of getting my order correct, greeting the customer and overall service experience. In terms, of my orders, they always got it correct and also the BELTs that I ordered were consistent with what I had asked. Great wrapping job as well as assembly job on the BELTs as well. Jn addition to the good food snd service, the atmosphere was always consistently clean and it wasn‚Äôt too quite or too loud. Overall, would highly recommend this Tim Hortons to anyone looking to grab a quick eats or a drink."
Tim Hortons (1384 Wellington Rd),3,"Average location.  My purchase was made in store.  Staff were attentive, quick and polite.  Location was reasonably clean.  Drive thru configuration seems a bit weird - in the time it took me to drink my coffee while sitting by the window I saw 6 different instances where people going into or coming out of the drive thru honked, or gave a one-fingered salute to another driver.  Great entertainment if you're in store though."
Tim Hortons (1384 Wellington Rd),1,"No one who works there seems to want to be working. Today, the bun they used was rock hard, and the sandwhich was barely edible. If I could do 0 stars, I would.
A year later and it has only gotten worse. As a diabetic who relies on the nutrition facts, I need consistency to maintain my blood sugar/insulin ratios. The wrap was half filled, and therefore, I either have to eat a plain wrap or jeopardize the carbohydrates. Waste of money."
Tim Hortons (1384 Wellington Rd),1,"This is probably the worst Tims in all of London. I would not recommend it to anyone. I‚Äôve only been here 3 times and each time has been a dreadful experience. The staff is rude and does not seem to want to work there. One time  in drive through they gave me the wrong order and then asked for it back so they could give it to the customer behind me. When I told them I could not give it back because I‚Äôve had already touched the food. They harassed me until I did. If I was the customer behind myself, I would be absolutely disgusted to know they gave me an order someone else has touched. They always have inconvenient problems occurring and are unorganized."
Tim Hortons (1384 Wellington Rd),1,The skinny Indian lady with the red lipstick at the window by far one of the worse I‚Äôve seen at Tim hortons.   She obviously hates her job.  She literally threw the coffee at me and goes ‚ÄúNEXT‚Äù to her coworker and shuts the window on my face.  It wasn‚Äôt even on a busy day. There was literally 1 person behind me.   Someone needs to fire her immediately.  There should be no place for her in customer service.
BEEBA BOYZ KITCHEN AND BAR,5,What a great find. Butter chicken was delicious and can't wait to explore the rest of the menu. A mix of Indian and North American foods.
BEEBA BOYZ KITCHEN AND BAR,5,Best aloo parantha ever and their Creamy Chicken bits were  too.. too good. Must try..
BEEBA BOYZ KITCHEN AND BAR,5,Love their brunch boxes! Everything is so fresh and homemade. Definitely try their baked goods. They are made in house and fresh. Will be going bakc to dine in soon!
BEEBA BOYZ KITCHEN AND BAR,5,"1st time here. We told our Tesla ""I'm Hungry"" and it pointed us to this gem. Great quality food (had burgers and shakes with my son) at a reasonable price. Place has a nice classic Diner setup."
BEEBA BOYZ KITCHEN AND BAR,5,"Food is an amazing Time Machine. It takes me back to the memories of the good times and helps me make some more for the future. This place has everything which needs to be recommended.
Clean and tidy
Amazing food
Great owners (family and locally owned)
Good portion size.
Did I forget to mention about the decent prices?
A classic diner experience with both Western and Indian food choices. The fries and chicken tikka naanwich were freshly made. A bit out of the way, but worth every penny.
COZ MEMORIES ARE PRICELESS......."
Dairy Queen (720 Proudfoot Lane),5,My sister bought my 30th birthday cake at this location after the location in Woodstock botched last year's cake and they did not disappoint. This cake tasted great but it looked really good too. The writing was fun but neat and I was really happy. I would definitely recommend!!
Dairy Queen (720 Proudfoot Lane),4,I was here 9 may to get my 16 year old a cake. The staff who helped .e was so polite and friendly. There was another woman working g too who was also friendly. Such a nice atmosphere. So clean and  right... lots of people having ice cream even at 1pm on a weekday. Really impressive  location
Dairy Queen (720 Proudfoot Lane),5,"Service was really really attentive, I believe it was the manager who took our order, he even took the food to the table which was really sweet. Wish it would have better outdoor sitting, no umbrellas or shade, would be nice to be able to sit outside since the inside is not the most modern."
Dairy Queen (720 Proudfoot Lane),4,"good service, fast. delicious ice cream for kids. cakes are available."
Dairy Queen (720 Proudfoot Lane),5,The employee that helped us today was fantastic and did a great job adding ‚ÄúHappy Mother‚Äôs Day!‚Äù On the cake we chose.
Shelby's Shawarma (West Five),1,Ordered 2 Medium Chicken bowls.  Unfortunately just a big bowl of rice and some veggies. No chicken in sight. This has happened on 2 separate occasions‚Ä¶ we won‚Äôt be back. Such a shame.
Shelby's Shawarma (West Five),5,"I had their shawarma for the first time and it was phenomenal. I am from Windsor and we have lots of shawarma shops here. When i ate from this place, i realized that shawarma from Windsor is nothing compared to this. They cook their pita bread in front of you in the store. It's fresh and has authentic crispiness to it. It was so good that i can drive 170km to have it again."
Shelby's Shawarma (West Five),3,"I have been eating at Shelby's since they opened and I have also noted that this locations portions sizes are very small compared to the other locations. I love shelbys, but this portion size issue needs to be fixed.
**********************
Update
******************************************
Well I did come back for a visit to your location and I did find the portions were back to what I would say is more in line with what I would expect.
Thanks for listening and you will see my continued business."
Shelby's Shawarma (West Five),5,"Had the privilege to meet the manager, Puneet, last night and we had an awesome chat.  He lives in the area and serves delicious food to our community here in West 5, but also the Talbot Village location.  I strongly recommend the rice/fries mix with chicken and beef bowl, it filled me up after a solid swim-workout last night!"
Shelby's Shawarma (West Five),5,"Today was my 2nd day in a row having lunch here. I was having a tough time deciding what to have. Puneet suggested a menu item for me to try and I was not disappointed. Don‚Äôt forget to grab a hibiscus drink and some baklava when you are cashing out!
Legendary customer service!

Burger King (1605 Saint-Denis St),5,"I don't get the bad comments. Maybe people are just ahole to the staff, but being polite goes both ways, I always had a smile and a good service. The food was always super warm, and the staff was amazing. I've been coming to the location for 2 years and never had a problem. Want an actual bad service? Just go to any McDonald's downtown, and you'll see by yourself."
Burger King (1605 Saint-Denis St),5,"I want to congratulate the whole night team for their hard work, all the times I‚Äôve been there the staff from the night where amazing, the food was well prepared, it was fresh and well done, the store was clean and the staff where very friendly and gentle, even at late hour."
Burger King (1605 Saint-Denis St),1,"I understand how it feels to work in an environment like this but because COVID is over, next try to open the second floor upstairs. Friendly staff but inside is dirty and slow service."
Burger King (1605 Saint-Denis St),2,"Even with simple order for 2persons they made a mistake -gave a hamburger simple instead of hamburger double paid.... Hamburger was quite good, but chicken nuggets and onion rings were not tasty. Nuggets, of course, better in McDo. I understand, to write comments for such kind of bistro does not make sense, but anyway..."
Burger King (1605 Saint-Denis St),5,"Late night saviour! Cashier was really nice and patient and helped us pick the best option for our personal tastes. Food was ready in minutes, nothing negative to report! Thank you!!!"
Pizza Pizza (St-Laurent Blvd.),3,"Very nice pizza joint that is clean and good. I tried their pizza, it is decent. But it is not the best. Their cauliflower fry is really good. Definitely try it with the jalape√±os dip. The garlic and cheese bread is also good. But it is not really good. Maybe the garlic bread is just good without the cheese. They accept cash and card. The point system is good to secure some points to get free pizza in the end. On the whole, it is a decent pizza joint that delivers"
Pizza Pizza (St-Laurent Blvd.),5,I ordered 2 pizzas‚ò∫Ô∏è amazing service the pizza was already prepared before i went but the pizzas were still fresh and staff conducted in a very polite way .. i really love this place
Pizza Pizza (St-Laurent Blvd.),1,"A disaster, unsanitary practices & abusive treatment. It took nearly 2 hours to get a ""proper"" pizza which doesn't even taste deliciously for 27+ bucks. It's stiff, not even warm and they add toppings like if it were freckles or something.

I give the guy tips and everything and he gives me a pizza that looks like it was dropped on the floor. The box was wet and easy to open, obviously tampered with. In truth, it should have been free. I call customer service and they said after much trouble okay we send a new pizza. It comes one hour later more...

Would have let it slide since hard days happen but the treatment of the delivery guy and the customer service man was obnoxious.  I can confirm for a fact this is the absolute last time I will ever order or eat Pizza Pizza products as they cannot guarantee that your food is properly cared for. I'm completely repulsed.

There are a bunch of affordable great places in Montreal who actually know HOW to make pizza (i.e. Atlas Pizza) and be a bit more humane. You deserve better."
Pizza Pizza (St-Laurent Blvd.),5,"After a late night out on Boulevard Saint Laurent, Pizza Pizza was our only vegan option. Thank you for making such an excellent vegan pie late at night. The plant-based chicken sandwich was exquisite as always. We recommend that Pizza Pizza continue to expand and ultimately transition to a fully plant-based menu"
Pizza Pizza (St-Laurent Blvd.),1,"Dead bugs, old shriveled slices, lady at front doesn't even pay attention to what you are asking her language barrier? said baked not fried....she said ""yes not fried"" and gave me a deep fried calzone."
Capitaine Sandwich,5,"Wow wow wow ! Walked in because it‚Äôs such an adorable little space on Duluth ! I asked what‚Äôs good and was recommended the Cor√©en. It was so yummy and refreshing ! I can‚Äôt wait to come back and try more !!! Places like these make Montreal the special city it is ‚ô•Ô∏è

Thank you !!"
Capitaine Sandwich,5,"Must try for a quick bite! We gobbled up all 3 sandwiches. Juicy, flavorful, warm are some words to describe them. In the order of preference (liking) - Le Big Nan, Cubaine and then Curry coco. Definitely recommended"
Capitaine Sandwich,5,"I am so happy to eat delicious sandwich and to have a great experience here. I cannot understand French, but a woman working here is so kind and friendly! I will come back again definitely!"
Capitaine Sandwich,5,"An exceptionally refreshing and very light sandwich with a perfect balance of ingredients and moist, fresh bread ; located in a very lovely area of the Montreal borough of le Plateau - it will make you feel like standing on your desk and blurting out poetry."
Capitaine Sandwich,5,Had the classic Cuban and it was super delicious. I also recommend you have their lemonade
Premi√®re Moisson (Gare Centrale),4,"I love this place for brunch, even if not traveling. Good food, though slightly overpriced"
Premi√®re Moisson (Gare Centrale),5,A salmon bagel for under $6 is unheard of in this economy
Premi√®re Moisson (Gare Centrale),5,The employee working there was very kind and the food and coffee was delicious! And a very good price.
Premi√®re Moisson (Gare Centrale),5,Dell Planetary comedy club.üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Premi√®re Moisson (Gare Centrale),5,Good coffee and excellent service.
Pizzaway,2,"Located in the basement unit, the place looks like your average generic run-down pizza shop.

Had the ""pepperoni"" and Mexican pizza slice. ""Pepperoni"" slice is halal so no pork. Whatever they used is beef with the texture of bologna instead.

The flavour is there for both slices but the dough is thick and the toppings left a doughy center that felt more raw than I'd like.

Price was alright but there are other pizza offerings in the area that are better for the same price"
Pizzaway,5,"If you love steak, you must try Pizza Way's Philly Steak Pizza. The tender steak slices, melted cheese, and perfectly baked crust are a match made in heaven. Their attention to detail and customer satisfaction make them my favorite pizza joint."
Pizzaway,4,"Pizza is very good ! My favorite is their BBQ pizza, their sauce with the chicken just hits diffirent ! I which they kept putting the bbq drizzle on top but overall their pizza is good top to bottom. Hats off to the hard working people over there cooking up the pizza and everything else üôèüôèüôè"
Pizzaway,2,"ORIGINAL REVIEW: Quality has remained excellent through the years and the pricing is very fair. They make a pretty good chicken sandwich.

UPDATED review: wow. I ordered a medium deluxe pizza for delivery and what I got was completely shameful. The toppings kept falling off, the bottom of the pizza was covered in sauce and gooey, and the dough is UNDERCOOKED. This is not a Pizza Way pizza."
Pizzaway,5,"Cheese lovers, rejoice! Pizza Way's Cheese Burger is a dream come true. The combination of melted cheese and juicy patty is pure indulgence. Their commitment to customer satisfaction and quality ingredients make it a top-notch choice."
A&W (Concordia),3,"The food was ok. The burger did not have a ton of flavor. It was also really small and kind of sad looking, but it was enough to tide you over. The fries too.

The root beer is what stole the show. It was as good as always. I wish the food could have been just as good.

The service was good. They got the food out quick. In this area, there are many great restaurants.  I would walk a little bit more and go to one of those."
A&W (Concordia),5,A&W is generally my favourite burger place! As a vegetarian it's pretty challenging to find a burger with a good patty! But this place does vegetarian magnificently! Their beyond burger is hands down the best veggie burger I've ever had! Yum! I can also recommend their sweet potato fries with that awesome smoky curry sauce. Good job A&W! I'll definitely return :-)
A&W (Concordia),5,The people here are so polite. It's refreshing ! Beyond burger - amazing cooked properly- long but worth the wsit. The bathroom was spotless. Thanks
A&W (Concordia),4,"Fresh food, personally think A&W is the best compared to other fast food that makes burgers. Poutine is tasty, their special sauce has spice or something that elevates it. I would recommend the mozza burger everyday."
A&W (Concordia),1,"Reception is disorderly, they struggle with keeping track of whose order is whose.

Prices are insanely high for the quality of food they put out.

The food is presentable but lacking taste or savour. Very dry.

27 dollars for two trios, one spicy chicken burger, the other chicken fingers. Both of which were mediocre at most.
The fries are very disappointing.

The place is very rundown and dirty. It looks like they don't clean up at all. Tables are not sanitised throughout the day it seems.

Not recommended."
Depanneur Tina Plus,5,"My favourite neighbourhood spot and one of the best in the city, I come here all the time. The owners are friendly and everything on the menu is excellent, cooked to perfection and reasonably priced. Cozy atmosphere, great food and great service!

Your first time here, you should try the specialty kumpir ‚Äî baked potato stuffed with many options for ingredients: cheeses, meats, veggies, condiments, etc. Filling, fresh and delicious!

But everything else on the menu is also great. My favourites are the kofte (beef) and chicken wraps. The hot drinks and desserts are also great ‚Äî the baklava especially.

Fully recommend!!"
Depanneur Tina Plus,5,"The food was so delicious, we couldn‚Äôt stop eating. My husband and I enjoyed the food and the atmosphere very much. With all the traveling we have been doing, this was a wonderful experience."
Depanneur Tina Plus,5,"This place is a real gem! Food is SO delicious, super clean and the a very friendly staff. You feel like home with no rushing to finish up and leave. 100% recommended!!"
Depanneur Tina Plus,5,"nice place, so clean, smells good and realy affordable, awesome service, the couple were friendly, we took the kumpir potato a huge portion and delicious, the kafta sandwich was tasty, the  turkish style bulgur was perfect, i love this place and recommend it"
Depanneur Tina Plus,5,"Best restaurant in the neighborhood!! We go there very often and we don‚Äôt get tired of it. The food is excellent: fresh, hearty, healthy and tasty. I love bringing friends there or recommending it to them because I know right away they‚Äôll love it. The owners are kind, gentle and always ready to recommend a dish.  Prices are also really good. If you go, do try their baklava, it is out of this world!!"
McDonald's (St-Christophe & Ste-Catherine),3,"Food was ok. They forgot to give me my happy meal and i had to ask. One way in and nowhere to wait for food, gets really crowded. Guy came up to my daughter and touched her hair talking to us unsolicited. I think ill be going to any other mcdonalds."
McDonald's (St-Christophe & Ste-Catherine),5,"I do not see the problem people have here. The food we had was of good quality. The employees were working hard, and the manager was leading the team well. They all were very nice to us, and nothing was missing from the order. I guess the store is located in a shady area, and probably therefore the seating area is closed. But we were fine!"
McDonald's (St-Christophe & Ste-Catherine),1,"Service ok but it‚Äôs really gross and dirty they should invest in 24/7 cleaners i witnessed an employee pushing down the garbage which was full then serving customers without washing her hands. Flies all over the donuts and then they put it in the display.Overall, gross."
McDonald's (St-Christophe & Ste-Catherine),1,"Very dirty restaurant
Urine smells in the main entrance to the middle of the restaurant.
They don't have the full menu, and the test of my order was horrible.
Only the coffee it was good as usual.
Pictures will come soon."
McDonald's (St-Christophe & Ste-Catherine),4,"This McDonald's tended to have a bad reputation due of being located in an area with sketchy & seedy people, but due of the dining seats being closed since the pandemic, these people don't stay there for long and if they do appear just take some distance from them. The foods are pretty accurate from what you expect from a McDonald's and the crew didn't make mistakes from my orders so far. The service are pretty good, it isn't as crowded than other downtown locations mainly because it's take-out only along with the weird crowd from the area. You can access to this location from Berri-Uqam Metro station at Saint-Catherine East street near Place Dupuis mall."
St-Hubert (Verdun),4,A quick and convenient spot. Food was decent. Staff was great. Probably one of the cleanest fast food restaurants I've ever been to. Their BBQ sauce was weird. The French fries were not the best. Chicken tenders were good.
St-Hubert (Verdun),1,"First time ordered thru Uber eats.  Forgot all 3 of my kids meals, could be uber eats fault though, but they burnt my bun.  Not impressed."
St-Hubert (Verdun),1,"Ordered a trio chicken leg last week.
The fries were not crispy & sawgy and tasted like carton but mainly the chicken was over cooked and very dried.
Not eat able at all and  I trashed it with discust.
Phoned 3 times to complain but I realized I wasted my time and energies.
Will NEVER order again, believe me.
You've lost another customer."
St-Hubert (Verdun),5,"Awesome has a St Hubert and a Harvey's attached!  So cool !
Super Nice Place, all renovated and clean.
Food and Staff were super GOOD and Nice! Will Def go back!  :)"
St-Hubert (Verdun),1,"I love St-Hubert but this one messes up orders every single time!!!! Absolutely disgusting! total joke considering the price paid!! Sometimes the fries looks like they have been cooked hours ago. Sometimes filets looks old and disgusting. Sometimes items are missing, for instance sauces or sauces are chunky. This time, cheese was molded on both poutine! ! honestly they should not be allowed to represent that brand! total joke!!!!"
Sandwicherie SAMING,5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Chef Mike‚Äôs creations and flavours come to life in your mouth! Also, the sandwiches and soups, bubble teas are the perfect filling meal for a good lunch! Food and sandwiches for all type of eaters; Let‚Äôs Go For VEGGIES! I highly recommend this healthy sandwich spot!"
Sandwicherie SAMING,5,They had great customer service and were so accommodating to make my sandwich and bubble tea vegan! Definitely would come back.
Sandwicherie SAMING,5,OMG their banh mi sandwiches are to die for. Try their pork belly it's absolutely amazing. Their bubble tea was also good. We went there at the end of their day and was served with a big smile and friendly service.  Will go again to try other things on their menu.
Sandwicherie SAMING,5,Hands down the best bami place in Montreal.
Sandwicherie SAMING,5,"Best banh mi around no doubt! Solid bubble teas as well. All for amazing prices. Great owner, solid spot all round"
Cafe et Crepe,4,"Great crepes! not too busy when we visited we were seated right away. We tried a few different crepes and they were all delicious! Worth ordering a selection and sharing.

Coffee was also good and staff was friendly."
Cafe et Crepe,4,The strawberry and banana Nutella was awesome. Not a fan of egg cheese and spinach crepe. Service can improve. Not organized. Did not get the latte we ordered with the food. Seems to be writing things on paper.
Cafe et Crepe,5,"A must stop place for any meal when in Montreal. A friend has been coming here since lady 17 years and  now I see why. It is awesome.  Service is great. Food is yummy. Drinks...well, what can I say...awesome! We went a bit overboard & ordered too much but pretty  much loved everything.  Shrimp crepe,  texmex fondue,  sangria,  beer, Spanish coffee...granmarnier crepe for desert.  Everything was super."
Cafe et Crepe,5,"This should be your go to place for Crepes in Montreal. Situated on St Catherine's street, this is a med sized restaurant with enough seating inside and out. We got the Nutella and strawberry Nutella crepes and the strawberries were so fresh and juicy. Loved everything!"
Cafe et Crepe,5,"We ordered strawberry crepes, ham and cheese crepes, and egg and cheese crepes. They are very delicious!!! The service is really good too!! Highly recommend this restaurant. However, the crepes are not really in big portions. I have been to many crepe restaurantT. Those crepes are stuffed to the rim with meat or cream or fruits. The crepes here are thin compared to others."
Copper Branch (Stanley),5,"One of my favourite places for great vegan food in a comfortable, somewhat fast food environment. The choices are always abundant and the dishes made fresh. I wish we would get some of these in BC."
Copper Branch (Stanley),4,"Stopped by for lunch today with my family, first time visiting this location. Unfortunately the highly advertised ruben was sold out, and we were only informed of this after we ordered, paid, and had been waiting a few minutes. Ended up ordering the tempeh sandwich which was delicious! My daughter loved the kids meal of nuggets, fries, veggies, and a hashbrown."
Copper Branch (Stanley),1,"This cost me 16$ from Uber Eats. Soggy bagel smaller than the palm of my already small hand + the base is so thin it can barely hold the contents. The photo on their menu shows a thick, opaque, luxurious layer of cream cheese. I barely got a lick, as you can see from the photos. And i added an extra hashbrown, completely left out. I ate the whole thing in 3 bites, it tasted super plain - and had to reorder my lunch from another place because i was still hungry. This place, this bagel, is a joke."
Copper Branch (Stanley),5,Very friendly staff. Ordered the poutine and Keto bowl and had a great meal! Everything is vegan too in case you're wondering.
Copper Branch (Stanley),5,Great plant based lunch menu. I had bagel sandwich with tempeh and Just Egg (BLT) to go and it was quite good!
Patisserie Harmonie,5,beautiful all you can eat hot pot with amazing modern decoration. recomended for group of friends or family to enjoy
Patisserie Harmonie,5,"Good variety, very clean, good quality food"
Patisserie Harmonie,5,"Glad they finally reopened.
The service was amazing, even better than pre-pandemic, and the food as good as always."
Patisserie Harmonie,5,Good quality and very clean!!! Perfect moment between friends !
Patisserie Harmonie,5,Very good Chinese food
Wendy's (530 Niagara St.),5,"Had breakfast with the newest sandwich, ""New Egg Blt"". Was perfect with good taste nor sloppy and portioned good for  a fast food breakfast. The potatoes were crispy wedges perfect for dipping in the ketchup cups.  Coffee was enjoyable. Customer service was good and no issues at all today."
Wendy's (530 Niagara St.),3,"Dave's single with cheese was great! Thank you!

edit 20230721: Regrettably, the two (2) JBC with no tomato fell short of expectations... notice the tomato... what if someone was allergic? My wife could not enjoy her lunch today!"
Wendy's (530 Niagara St.),1,"I‚Äôve been here several times and they really need to stop being stingy with bacon. Anytime I buy something with bacon, they either don‚Äôt include any or just throw 1 or 2 tiny pieces in. You can barely taste the bacon because it‚Äôs so scarce. Stop being stingy!"
Wendy's (530 Niagara St.),4,"First time at this Wendy's location.

We were at Nickel Beach and my son was asking for fries.

I Google it and it brought me to this Wendy's.

The fries were very fresh and delicious. Our burgers were also delicious

The staff member was very patient and helpful when we were deciding what to order.

Fully recommended üòâüòÅüòéü§üüèªüá®üá¶üçÅ"
Wendy's (530 Niagara St.),1,"Has to be the worst location, employees don't care about service. Waited at the register for someone to take my order and they didn't seem to care. Ended up ordering on the mobile app as it was quicker. The kitchen was littered with fries and veggies on the floor. Once I got the food the fries tasted like the outside was cooked and the inside was still raw. Better to drive to another location because the employees here could really care less about how the service and food is."
District Bagel Kosher,5,Everything was fresh and delicious! It‚Äôs a good place to get breakfast fastly with high quality
District Bagel Kosher,5,"The Bagels are delicious!
They also have a variety of pastries amongst many others!"
District Bagel Kosher,5,"These guys make the best vehicles, by the way. The coffee is not bad as well, but service is fantastic. With God's Al week's happening. And the guys have a smile on their face.
When you give service with a smile on your face, the food tastes much better and over. Here, that's exactly what it's all about.
Yes

Keep it up"
District Bagel Kosher,5,"This place has great service, the servers are fast, always polite and have a smile on their face. The food is always good I've never had a problem with it. The bagels are out of this world!!!"
District Bagel Kosher,1,"Oh, no.... The dented bagel was not cooked properly because the dough was clumped together. It tastes like raw dough. Why are the reviews good?"
Julian‚Äôs Comptoir Gourmand,5,"What a great find near Mount Royal Park! Was a great way to refuel after walking up to the Chalet.

Excellent spot for brunch, breakfast, smoothies and coffee. I had the tuna poke bowl with quinoa and my brother had the breakfast bowl with a side of berry pancakes. Everything was absolutely delicious. Their decor is really soothing too with lots of plants and natural light.

Highly recommend if you‚Äôre in the area."
Julian‚Äôs Comptoir Gourmand,5,"While on vacation in the city and walking down St. Laurent, we stumbled upon this place by coincidence since it was lunch time.

We ordered the Unicorn tuna tataki salad and the Cubano sandwich to share between two people.  The portions were good and the food tasted great. Ingredients were fresh and the food preparation was fantastic. The people working here should be proud of the food they serve.

It's a small spot but it had a few tables and just by the people coming in alone, it seems like a popular takeout lunch spot.

This was a very great find by complete accident. I would highly recommend stopping in at this place if you're in the neighborhood."
Julian‚Äôs Comptoir Gourmand,5,"The food is delicious...like...""stop yourself from eating so fast"" delicious. And it's the only place to get a decent smoothie in the area. Staff is great. Everything is easy to take to-go, or dine in. It's all the best parts of quick diner service and chef-made healthy food. Good for breakfast, lunch, or a hangover."
Julian‚Äôs Comptoir Gourmand,5,"I was so curious as to why this place had such good ratings, but now I know. This spot is a hidden gem. The food was amazing! I had the unicorn salad, and I think it was probably the best salad I've ever had. My friend got the chicken burger and said it was extremely juicy, tender and flavourful. The prices are fair, even on the cheaper side in my opinion. The inside decor is so adorable, and the staff is extremely friendly. Would 11/10 recommend. I will definitely be coming back again and again!"
Julian‚Äôs Comptoir Gourmand,5,super warm & friendly customer service and delicious food & drinks!
La Belle Province (Sherbrooke Est),5,We ordered the LBP burger combo and upgrade fries for medium size poutine. The burger was exceptional! Staff really cared about their food and customers.
La Belle Province (Sherbrooke Est),5,Food was very tasty with fast service. They even accommodated us in English. Would for sure come back again.
La Belle Province (Sherbrooke Est),5,"Staff was friendly, courteous and pleasant.  The food was fresh, nice and delicious.  They love what they do and it shows with the ambience, the food and everything. Definitely a must for a nice quick and tasty bite to eat."
La Belle Province (Sherbrooke Est),4,"The food was ok. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the most amazing. The fries were a bit sweet and soggy. The poutine was also good (the poutine with grilled chicken). The servers were all exceptionally nice, and it all round a fun reasonably priced experience."
La Belle Province (Sherbrooke Est),5,"First time I ate there in my life, probably one of the best poutine I had too. Simple and solid"
Boulangerie Ange Masson,4,"Pot Masson is a nice place to come for a drink. I can't say I've tried the food. I did however eat the chicken wing that www stuck on top of my partners drink. Didn't have to much flavour to it. The bloody Masson was great but the Lemonade Verde felt like juice. There was apple In my drink which is nice but I'm not happy that I was given two rotten apples.

Overall the patio is nice to enjoy on the sidewalk nothing to complain about there. Would come back in the future. Would of been nice to see sangria on the menu. Maybe in the future..."
Boulangerie Ange Masson,4,"Service was quick and our waiter was nice. The food was decent. The quantities were good, not too much, just enough. I would have preferred if the bagels where Montreal type babels but not bad at all. The atmosphere was nice."
Boulangerie Ange Masson,5,Great place. They have this 7$ for 3 beers special from 4 to 7. The staff are always really chill and fun. Honestly a cosy little spot to spend an evening with friends.
Boulangerie Ange Masson,3,"Great vibe and the drinks are good but the food is just so so and everything is in small portions. It took 30-40min for my food to come out That was a little disappointing considering that everything was so small in portion and the food i chose was either fried or fresh. I tried the evening menu, perhaps the brunch menu is better."
Boulangerie Ange Masson,5,"This is a lovely little cafe on the promenade Masson. They have a large selection of cocktails and even offer a lunchtime happy hour between noon and 1pm. There must be a lot of happy workers returning from their lunch breaks in this neighborhood.
They have just opened up outdoors seating again now that the weather has finally turned warm. They also keep the place open to the fresh air when it's warm enough.
I ordered the salmon eggs Benedict and it was pretty good. The service was excellent too and I enjoyed my visit. There's a lot to discover on the promenade Masson, so I will be back again to check out the rest of the area."
B&M (Saint-Viateur),5,"ü§©Amazing cr√™pes & french onion soup! ü§©
Trendy lil spot for brunch w. excellent customer service and delicious food! Very reasonably priced with food that comes out within 15m of ordering üôÉüëåüèº Generous portion sizes and all just all around great place. 5/5 stars! üëèüèº"
B&M (Saint-Viateur),5,Wow. Best breakfast in years. Amazing bagel with locks.  Crazy potatoes and beans. Fresh orange juice and great coffee. Will be back 100%
B&M (Saint-Viateur),4,Great choices for breakfast! Food arrived quick and prices were good. The Chocolate Chip Crepe was delicious!
B&M (Saint-Viateur),5,"Clean, minimalist setting. Perfect ambience! The food was delicious. Had breakfast here and the presentation was lovely. Breakfast here set the mood right for the day! üòä"
B&M (Saint-Viateur),4,"Solid standard for breakfast in Montreal. The service is always great. It gets pretty busy on weekends, but can easily get a table past 1pm."
"Ben & Florentine (300, chemin du Golf)",5,"The food is awesome, great portion, and yet, not expensive. I went there couple of times and I ordered a new meal every time and I was satisfied with the quality and taste every single time. The personnel are welcoming and friendly!
I absolutely recommend this place to have a quality breakfast or brunch."
"Ben & Florentine (300, chemin du Golf)",2,"Thursday July 13, 8.30 am . Have ordered takeout a few times and the food is good. The problem is when you dine in the service is lacking. This morning waited 5 minutes to be seated at the entrance. After being seated waited another 10 minutes with two waiters passing by multiple times without taking my order taking my order. Waiters seem uninterested and lacking service skills. After 10 minutes of waiting I stood up and left."
"Ben & Florentine (300, chemin du Golf)",5,Good breakfast food and a comfy environment! We had a great server and needed to kill some time so we sat in the restaurant for some time. I got a smoothie and a wrap that was delicious and my fianc√© got a waffle that he enjoyed.
"Ben & Florentine (300, chemin du Golf)",2,"It used to be a nice place with good service, but today's lunch was a huge disappointment for me.
The restaurant was almost empty, but despite that, I had to wait to be seated. Then I had to wait to make an order, and then I had to wait to pay. I felt like a waitress was ignoring me. Normally, waiters come from time to time to check if you need anything or to suggest a coffee refill. That didn't happen to me this time. The service was terrible, the worst I have ever seen in brunch places"
"Ben & Florentine (300, chemin du Golf)",2,"Service is excellent friendly and very helpful (and very busy probably over worked) but the food is not up to my expectations for a 15-20$ / plate resto.
To start the coffee was undrinkable. The tea was very nice.
The potato's are frozen, they taste ok but for the price one expects real potatoes like the other breakfast places of the same price range.
The ham was flavourless and greasy. The sausage was good, bacon was also good but my partner thought it didn't taste so fresh.
Eggs were also acceptable.
Toast was more bread than toast.
Fresh fruit waffle came with grapes (warm grapes? Gross) banana and 3 strawberries, and a drizzle of ""English cream"" that ..well I won't say what it looked like here if I'm being polite üò¨ I was highly disappointed compared to the waffles I get at all the other breakfast places, with good amounts of non-watery English cream and fresh berries not cheap bananas and grapes.
Half the resto is nice, the other half is in the ""sunroom"" and is loud and cold when the sun isn't shining.

The table has an extremely sticky edge. Even after they cleaned it
..It's not on the table top but the edge all around it really bothered me.

Our waitress tried her best to make us happy which I appreciate but it wasn't her fault, nor do I think it's the kitchens fault..there's a good quality problem."
Au Pain Dor√© (Rouen),5,"They have miche bread we love, good choices of salads for lunch, sandwiches, many choices of bread and desert, the staff are very kind and professional, it's a very small space, maybe enough for 3 people to comfortably stand and wait for their order, it's take out only and you can sit outside at the picnic tables."
Au Pain Dor√© (Rouen),1,"Ordered from uber eats since i was told that this was a good breastfast spot.

I ordered two croissant with ham and cheese from the sandwhich categorie and i received a breakfast sandwhich with an egg inside. I asked for one with mayo and one withh mustard... The mayo croissant was overflowing with way to much mayo that is was covering the egg enterily. Not at all what i ordered and i had to throw it out .

When I called the caf√© and asked why there was an error in my order when it was a simply order with out any modifications whats so ever. They said that item should not have been on the menu and while I was on the phone she removed the two sandwhiches from the menu saying they only have the options with eggs.

I asked uber for a refund. and I will not be ordering from there again."
Au Pain Dor√© (Rouen),4,"Snacks,  salads, coffee, cakes, breads, kambuch and other stuff
Quality: Good, specifically cakes
Price: $-$$ you can buy yesterday cakes and breads , some snacks are quite  $$.
Staff: friendly and good behavior.
They can make personalized snacks."
Au Pain Dor√© (Rouen),4,Great eclairs! Not to sweet but at the same time good flavour. Not the best I had but it is pretty good. The stuffing is a bit lacking although it is filled with it. They packed it in a nice box which didnt ruin tbe eclairs. Will be coming back for sure!!
Au Pain Dor√© (Rouen),5,"Nice place for a breakfast or a quick snack highly recommend, same price range as Tim Horton but a local business."
Arthurs Nosh Bar,5,Outstanding food. I had the Moroccan Toast at Sunday Brunch and was blown away at the flavor. Great time sitting outside. My only wish is that there would be a kids menu.. but I knew there wasn't before we came (or at least it wasn't offered to our 7yo and we didn't see evidence of one so I assume there is none.) I would definitely return here.
Arthurs Nosh Bar,5,"One of the best brunch spots in Montreal, the wait is long, both times I went I had to wait about 2h to be seated but the food is totally worth it. The Moroccan toast is to die for, I come from Morocco and the eggplant salad is so authentic, it brings me back to home. The pancakes are also very delicious, so fluffy and sweet. Overall the food is really good."
Arthurs Nosh Bar,5,"You‚Äôll wait from 1h to 1:30h but it‚Äôll worth it! Fast service, great mimosas, the chicken is a bit spicy but it‚Äôs incredibly delicious. Pancakes are very fluffy and yummy."
Arthurs Nosh Bar,3,"I‚Äôd heard about Arthur as one of the best brunch places in Montreal. I‚Äôd also heard about the long wait time before being served and I was ready for that. It took 30 minutes to get us.

We were given a table for two, which was next to a pillar in the middle of the restaurant, and it was not comfortable at all, and there was very little space to sit.

We ordered fried chicken and regular coffee. Our coffee was served without anything besides! There was no trace of milk, sugar, or coffee spoon on the table! We asked for milk for our coffee and it took six minutes to serve the milk for only one of us.

The glass of water on the table was extremely cloudy!!! It gave the feeling that it was dirty and had not been washed for a long time.

Our waiter was extremely welcoming and I liked her approach. Let's move on to the food. We ordered fried chicken and it took a while to be served. The taste of the chicken was great but it was very spicy, so I don't think it was ideal for breakfast.  The bacon was burnt and there was a piece of eggshell on my plate!!!

The prices did not match at all compared to the food and service that was given to us. Considering that Montreal is a brunch city and I have eaten a lot of brunches with better quality and lower prices in this city!

Honestly, my expectation was much higher from a brunch spot that is so famous."
Arthurs Nosh Bar,5,"Brunch at Arthurs‚Ä¶

Let‚Äôs address the elephant in the room; the wait time. So i was scrolling on the reviews of Arthurs before going and I saw most of its negative reviews were about its long waiting time. Well guess what, I‚Äôve had to wait an hour too and i wasn‚Äôt that mad about it, after my brunch. What do you expect from a small family owned breakfast place that is known for being the best brunch place on the island. So if you‚Äôre reading this review and you are impatient,  then Arthur ain‚Äôt for you. If you‚Äôre the opposite, grab a protein bar and chill outside and wait as the others, if you can‚Äôt do that, go somewhere else cause Montreal isn‚Äôt short on brunch places.

Now that‚Äôs said, let‚Äôs move on to the foods. We were a group of 3. The brunch and regular menu were available for us. We ordered the Moroccan toast, the spicy fried chicken and smoked salmon from their brunch menu, with a side of pancakes. Yes it did take some time to come, but i didn‚Äôt mind as we were having a great time talking with each over. Because of the place‚Äôs ambiance we even started talking with our neighbours and asking them for their choices on the menu. Their dishes reflect another level of quality. Everything was delicious. From their coffee to their fried chicken, everything were cooked to perfection. The Moroccan toast was a surprise for me, the layers of flavour was amazing. Their pancakes are a must! Fried chicken wasn‚Äôt even that greasy, the beef bacon was a discovery for me and they don‚Äôt miss on their hot sauce üî•

On to the service, our waiter was really welcoming and attentive to us. Although, he was busy with the other tables, he always pass by ours to ask if we needed anything. Mind you, that the Brunch service happens every weekends and that place do not slow down. Your service team deserves all my praises üôåüèæ

When its comes to pricing, Arthurs is on the pricey side when it comes to brunch but, their quality and quantity can‚Äôt be compared to other places. Their smoked salmon is homemade and our waiter even explained to us where they get their beef bacon. If you‚Äôre a big group, get all the dishes from the brunch menu as it‚Äôs worth the price if you want to share. I also, purchased a salami sandwich and really didn‚Äôt mind the price as the quality was really good.

Overall, Brunch at Arthurs was a first but not a last for me. For me brunching with friends is to have a good time,  great food and a great start of the day, Arthurs delivers just that with its quality dishes and amazing service."
Freshii (Maisonneuve),1,"I usually order from here through A La Carte Express and their salads are quite good but this time i decided to order extra steak with my Chou kale cesar only to find the bowl half empty- barely any kale and mostly quinoa. There was no sauce and at first I was grateful I at least ordered extra steak to fill me up, only to find out it was very fatty pork and not steak. I don‚Äôt eat pork so this was a very inedible half empty dish for me."
Freshii (Maisonneuve),4,"EDIT: the customer service was so prompt and immediately took care of this!

I really love Freshii and visit usually twice a week. I almost always order the Tex Mex and usually it‚Äôs perfect but yesterday half the ingredients were missing and they forgot the sauce. It was an unpleasant experience unfortunately."
Freshii (Maisonneuve),1,"I absolutely love freshii, this location is the absolute worst experience I've ever had. They forgot half the ingredients that actually go in the bowl, and paid for extra ingredients and none of them were in the meal. They forgot half the order completely and the smoothies that were ordered (which, let me reiterate, I LOVE them food and smoothies) were absolutely disgusting. I am so dissapointed and will not be returning. This ruined my perspective on this company, I can't believe they would let a location be run like this, especially for how expensive this food can be."
Freshii (Maisonneuve),1,"I used to love coming here a few years ago and hadn‚Äôt been back in a while. I ordered the same thing I used to order and it was awful. Way too much rice in my burrito and two pieces of tofu when I payed extra for it. Some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced, I was barely even acknowledged. Food didn‚Äôt taste fresh at all, portions were small and the restaurant looked like it was dirty and falling apart. 0/10."
Freshii (Maisonneuve),2,The price charged is higher than the advertised price in the menu pamphlet which the cashier told me to look at. They didn‚Äôt do anything to refund me or whatnot. Poor customer service. Such practices should be prohibited for the customer interests as this should be considered fraud. (2 stars for the food tastes fresh)
Restaurant Laterna,5,They have the best hot dogs in Montreal and their fries are very good!
Restaurant Laterna,5,"Very nice people working there!
Loved the food, good old fashioned restaurant, I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants a nice and good breakfast!"
Restaurant Laterna,5,"Tip: When you see a little place that looks yummy, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS GO IN.

I've been here twice now, and I love it. The french fries are AMAZING. Cheeseburger AMAZING. I will try everything on the menu eventually. üòä

Owners/staff are very friendly. It's laidback and casual. Great prices, too."
Restaurant Laterna,5,"This is my favourite restaurant. The fries are always great. I generally get souvlaki or fish and chip, but burgers and hot dogs are good too."
Restaurant Laterna,5,"Are you kidding me?!
I had a tremendous hotdog, a great burger, fries and a smoked meat sandwich (huge portion of meat) and a diet soda for 25 dollars. In the current economy it's a great deal."
Madame Dibou les Gateaux,5,"Best cr√™perie outside of France and Switzerland for an authentic Galette Bretonne. Concise menu with the classics (ham, cheese, egg, vegetarian) and some gourmet options, all with quality ingredients and in the perfect ratio. Wonderful selection of imported treats, ingredients and wines to browse whilst waiting for your order, the service is super friendly and passionate about all their goods.
Will definitely come back to Montreal just for this store ü©∑"
Madame Dibou les Gateaux,5,"The owner is so friendly and helpful, and his knowledge of the products is very deep. His recommendation of a limited batch strong cider was truly phenomenal, I cannot recommend this place enough!"
Madame Dibou les Gateaux,5,"My partner and I came in for some savoury crepes. The flavour combinations and portion sizes were perfect!

The young man who took our order was very nice and attentive. The gentleman who was cooking brought our food out and was very welcoming.

We also got a bakes dessert with prunes inside that was really tasty.  Great place with reasonable prices. Very clean inside too üëè"
Madame Dibou les Gateaux,5,"Beautiful & cute spot for buckwheat crepes (both sweet and savory) and some drink. They are prepared freshly in front of you and are gluten-free + there are great vegetarian option (idk about vegan though). It is quite yummy and nice to take with you to eat at, for example, parc la Fontaine :) The owner was extremely nice."
Madame Dibou les Gateaux,5,"I loved this place. Is super cozy, wine is good, it feels like arriving to an old friend home.

The people attending is super friendly and funny plus they do really good crepes with high quality ingredients and flavors.

You should definitely come and grab a crepe and some wine. The sweets also looked great."
Cora D√©jeuners et Diners (1396 avenue du Mont Royal),4,"We went for breakfast, the food ok is not amazing but is a nice breakfast, the portions are ok and coffee was good. What definitely make it a good place to eat is the staff, super friendly and very helpful, i went with a stroller and a six month old and they were awesome. The atmosphere is perfect, music is ok not too loud so you can chat and enjoy your breakfast with your family."
Cora D√©jeuners et Diners (1396 avenue du Mont Royal),3,"It's been a while since I enjoyed being in Cora branches, but this branch made my decision for the future a bit foggy ,
3 ladies were serving us there, Anne, Annick, and Chantal, in comparison with Ontario branches. It was small, and we could not find maple syrup on the table. In Ontario, there is jam and butter and ketchup.
In this branch, it was not.

Usually, in Ontario, you get coffee top up, and here they didn't offer us.

Something that made me nervous, was the milk, they figure it out (Annich told us), but the decision is hard to take, reputation of your brand or 6 sick customer, that the milk was not good and offered us 3 new cappuccino, but I told them be careful we are traveling and it's not good to be sick with dieriha üòÅin a road trip.

Even with the situation, we didn't get sick, and the food was good.

If I were the manager of that branch, I give Annick a raise because I didn't enjoy the atmosphere of cora and the food this time, I can't forget Annick decision that saved us from being sick on our trip."
Cora D√©jeuners et Diners (1396 avenue du Mont Royal),5,"Great classic brunch spot that‚Äôs also kid and stroller friendly! Great and friendly service, and super accommodating when we had to switch tables because we needed more space for a stroller and toddler!"
Cora D√©jeuners et Diners (1396 avenue du Mont Royal),3,Good service clean restraunt food is not to die for but cooked right. Its corporate Cora not the cook or this establisments fault.
Cora D√©jeuners et Diners (1396 avenue du Mont Royal),3,"The waiter had problems with english, and gave me another thing I didn't order. After asking her to change it, again my order was wrong but my partner was waiting for me and I didn't cause problems because they could not understand me."
District Bagel Park Avenue,5,"Nice computerized system you put your order and you get at123 fresh special made bagels, amazing drinks cappuccino mochachino and more"
District Bagel Park Avenue,5,Lox sandwich was just like a New York deli and the cheese blintzes were delicious as well. The orange juice is fresh-squeezed and the other drinks are great as well
District Bagel Park Avenue,5,"Very friendly staff, easy to order with their ordering machine at the front :)"
District Bagel Park Avenue,5,Best place for breakfast and lunch delicious food a bit expensive but manageable. Highly recommend
District Bagel Park Avenue,4,Nice spot
Le Plezl,5,Salad is too salty but salmon sandwich is sooo good also onecard accepted :)
Le Plezl,2,"I would prefer a lunch of assembled available kosher items from a supermarket to the one I had here, though I stress that my review is based on my family's single experience. Our experience in this restaurant was disappointing. Some of the (very) limited menu items were unavailable, sandwiches took unreasonably long to prepare in the near-empty restaurant, and the prices seemed rather high for the portion sizes and food quality. The fries appeared several minutes before the sandwiches, and they were greasy, limp, and undersalted. Nothing in our order tasted great, but everything was okay. I doubt I will return to this restaurant on subsequent visits to Montr√©al."
Le Plezl,3,"It's a very small place with about 10 tables. The food is very simple; salad, paninis, sandwiches and some simple desserts. Its a nice place to just come and eat quickly or grab a bite on your way somewhere. It's very clean and neat and cozy."
Le Plezl,5,"A great place for kosher keeping people staying in downtown. I went there twice and ordered once to my hotel using uber eats, which is a very convenient option."
Le Plezl,5,"One of the scarce kosher places open during Pessah : good and fresh, nice and warm hosts
Thanks Habad, like always a safe place and welcoming to be everywhere in the world"
L'Oeufrier (Masson),5,"A long line up when we arrived. Yet we were greeted by friendly staff. English menu was available, you just have to ask for it. Good portion of the dishes and the sausage are really good. Highly recommended."
L'Oeufrier (Masson),5,Delicious breakfast with a variety to please everyone and great service.
L'Oeufrier (Masson),1,"Very disappointed as we come here often. Called this morning to get take out for my very sick mother.
Picked it up as get home to find they forgot part of our order. It happens. So we called to get a refund for the missing items and were told we would have to drive back, find parking on Masson and come I to get the money back. I have a sick mother and a cranky toddler - I should not have to drive back to fix their mistake!"
L'Oeufrier (Masson),5,"The best breakfast in town. I love ordering from here. The food is fresh, on time and always delicious. This is my third time ordering and I haven‚Äôt been disappointed once. Fast, friendly service. And always accurate. Great choice all around."
L'Oeufrier (Masson),3,"Waitress was so lovely and the food was good, it was a nice place to go with friends!"
La Plan√®te Oeuf,2,"Went on a holiday and was severely disappointed with the service. We were originally told to sit wherever, but I guess we chose a spot that was a little out of the waiting staff‚Äôs eye as getting service was incredibly difficult. Food is okay, classic breakfast options but I think the biggest issue is the restaurant is understaffed."
La Plan√®te Oeuf,4,"An old restaurant with lovely atmosphere. The eggs are so funny and the service is so warm. It‚Äôs a family own restaurant so I guess the waitress is the hostess. She is really friendly. And the host may be the chef, who is also very friendly and we have some interesting talk. The food is above the bar and the price is reasonable. The setting of the food is one of the highlights."
La Plan√®te Oeuf,3,"Group of two, when we arrived, we had been seated very quickly. The menu was all in french but that's okay as I'm from Montreal. I was taken a back a little when I noticed that food portions are small which I wasn't impressed by. The food quality was alright. Prices didn't make sense for what was being served considering other breakfast places serve more for the same price."
La Plan√®te Oeuf,5,"This is a terrific breakfast spot for families. The portions are generous with a lot of selection and the execution is solid. My boys loved their crepes with bananas and chocolate, while my wife and I enjoyed an omelette and eggs Benedict.
The servers are super sweet with the kids. You‚Äôll need to pack your French with you, but like most places as long as you‚Äôre trying you‚Äôll get there.
Did not try the fruit smoothies though saw so many of them served I think we will have to come back and have them next time"
La Plan√®te Oeuf,4,"A solid neighborhood brunch place. Nothing hipster or really elevated but the menu has a lot of options and combinations, including American style pancakes, which drew me to try it. The bacon was crispy, the smoked meat was nice and hot, and the service was friendly."
Boulangerie de Froment et de S√®ve,5,"It was the BEST bakery in Montreal. The bakery has various kinds of bread, cheese, jam, goodies and snacks etc. The employees are so kind and we enjoyed this experience a lot! Also it is a perfect place for outdoor brunch!"
Boulangerie de Froment et de S√®ve,5,"This place has the best pastries ever, specially the canele√©!! Every time I‚Äôm in Montr√©al this is always my first stop! Must go and try their delicious coffee as well!"
Boulangerie de Froment et de S√®ve,2,"I would like to start by saying that I've been coming here to buy bread for at least 10 months and I have been coming here VERY often to get coffee for the past 3 months, the bread and desserts here are amazing and most of the staff is nice (there are 2 ladies that 90% of the time have had a really bad attitude and almost have been rude to me) but I have one constant problem I keep ordering  DECAF coffees and today is the 5th time in 3 months they gave me a caffeinated coffee,  I have an anxiety disorder and I'm extremely sensitive to caffeine and alcohol, I would really appreciate it if the people that work there would actually care to follow the specifications we want in our orders."
Boulangerie de Froment et de S√®ve,3,"[Edit to respond: The price on Ubereats is 7.95$ per B√ªchette. Check that. You set this price on Ubereats, didn‚Äôt you? I guess it‚Äôs fair enough for me to say it‚Äôs eight dollar. ]I like the packaging which was really cute. I bought one croissant and the coffret d√©gustation de b√ªche. I enjoyed the croissant a lot, probably one of the best croissant in Montreal. It was very crispy on the outside and tender, but slightly chewy inside. I didn‚Äôt even need to heat it up. On the other hand, the cakes were average and a bit pricey ( around 8 dollar for a small piece). The taste was not bad, I just thought the colorant in the Macaron not necessary. The icing on the raspberry one was not evenly spread. But overall, I would come again for their croissant."
Boulangerie de Froment et de S√®ve,5,"Really tasty and freshly baked bread!
The little terrace outside is perfect for brunch.
Recommend it if you want to experience the French style of bakery and sandwiches!"
Caf√© B√©n√©dictins,5,"Amazing brunch and comfort food in here! Very friendly and attentive staff and cozy environment.
The poutine breakfast is all you can ask in a meal: you have the hearty potato, the melted-sometimes-crispy cheese with the meats and a perfectly poached egg on the top. Definitely a must try dish!"
Caf√© B√©n√©dictins,5,"July 18, 2023; adding 2nd review since I ordered again by ubereat and I have some pics, still awesome. Nice and warm, not too salty, generous quantity and delicious sauce and amazing potatoes. This place rocks!

1st review: I just ordered Benedictine dish by delivery (sorry I ate everything no picture) and everything was fresh and delicious. The potates and hollandaise sauce were amazing, I can imagine how good breakfast poutine must be. I'm glad that I have found another nice brunch spot, next time I will be dining in the restaurant üòÄ"
Caf√© B√©n√©dictins,5,"Our weekly spot for brunch. The team is just amazing. It's a traditional brunch place : big portions, good quality and affordable price."
Caf√© B√©n√©dictins,5,"Very popular place, so you may have to wait to get seated during the weekend crowd, but the service is fast and friendly. Generous portions, breakfast in all its varieties are offered here with coffee refills just when your thinking another cup would be nice! Tips are appreciated at the cash."
Caf√© B√©n√©dictins,5,Absolutely love this restaurant! My husband and I come here all the time. The staff are always friendly and serve the best breakfasts around!
Au Pain Dor√© (C√¥te-des-Neiges),1,"Very bad experience with this restaurant (Uber eats). Ordered grilled cheese and chocolatine aux amandes but the quality is very bad, and even you can do better at home. They are just taking Walmart quality bread, cheese and bacon and warming it, no special restaurant ingredients. Quality feels superrrr cheap and not tasty at all. No service issue, just the food was testing bad."
Au Pain Dor√© (C√¥te-des-Neiges),5,"I tried the caramel macchiato 10/10 and hot chocolate 6/10 6 bc even tho was just an average hot chocolate, tasted like cacao and that was was like ok, not that bad, actually I drank it.

The chocolatine was REALLY good. 10/10
The ricotta cake was really good too 10/10"
Au Pain Dor√© (C√¥te-des-Neiges),3,"Nice place, good caf√© food and coffee. They rarely clean tables. They may clear them and clients are expected to clear their own, but even if they are doing the clearing, the do not clean them. Also, free refill on coffee but they never ever tell anybody that."
Au Pain Dor√© (C√¥te-des-Neiges),5,"Coffee and bread were both perfect.
I had a great experience with my friends here and would definitely visit again."
Au Pain Dor√© (C√¥te-des-Neiges),5,Thank you Au Pain for offering free hot beverage  for the birthday.  I always order the portugous natas  here. And moca  was so good
Banh Mi Hanoi,5,The banh mi was delicious here!  I can't get over how fresh the bread was...it was so good. The menu had a great variety they had the classic cold cuts to vegetarian options. Don't let the outside construction deter you it's worth it to visit for the food. Got to the meet the owner as well and she was lovely to chat to.
Banh Mi Hanoi,5,This is the BEST b√°nh m√¨ I've ever eaten! The sauce is absolutely delicious! Will definitely order again.
Banh Mi Hanoi,5,"The banh mi here is amazing. Not only are they generous with the toppings, the baguette is exactly how I like it. Crisp, airy and dense enough to soak the mayo and pate. Ordered for my entire family and they loved it as much. They also have variety of fresh fruit smoothie and imported Cafe from Vietnam for coffee enthusiasts. Amazing service and amazing food. Will definitely be coming back again."
Banh Mi Hanoi,5,"Banh Mi Hanoi and it is an absolute neighborhood gem! My personal favorite is their vegetarian banh mi - the tofu is flavorful and perfectly cooked, vegetables are fresh, and the bread is perfectly toasted. I highly recommend stopping by the shop if you get the chance!"
Banh Mi Hanoi,5,"The cutest place, a little hidden by the construction but don't let that deter you from taking the detour to get there. The quality of the ingredients was exceptional. The bread was so fresh and the fillings were delicious (get #5) the owner was so fun and bubbly. 10/10 would come back"
Vegateau,1,"Ordered on UberEats and the small box was not even half full‚Ä¶ Only the bottom on the box was covered with food, it was about 2/3 empty.

So disappointing especially considering the price. On top of that, the broccoli was undercooked. Not eating here again. I‚Äôve been to other Cooper Branch locations and received more much food, this one clearly is reducing portion sizes as much as they can. Really disappointed with my experience."
Vegateau,3,"Honestly good but not crazy, I think it could be easily improve with maybe more spices ü§î it would be nice to have the brocolis cut in smaller pieces too so we can enjoy all the flavors together! Also paying 17 dollars for a bowl and still being hungry is frustrating :/
Staff was kind :)"
Vegateau,1,"We've ordered twice for pickup here and both times our orders were delayed or wrong. Today we ordered a ultimate breakfast skillet but an ultimate breakfast bagel was packed. Mistakes are fine but I went back in to let the staff know behind the counter but they insisted it was right.

I had to resort to loading the website and showing pictures. It took about 5 mins of explaining what we ordered vs what they delivered to have our order rectified. Finally I left with the right order to find out it had been served with rice and sweet potato which isn't what a breakfast skillet is supposed to have. See attached photo.

I didn't bother to go back in at this point

We love the food here, it's healthful, delicious and sustainable. But this has been a really bad experience and they made no concessions as a way of apology"
Vegateau,5,The food gave me the ability to levitate and turn invisible. Delicious.
Vegateau,5,Beets burger is their specialty. I am very happy to learn that fast food is becoming healthier.
Wendy's (7295 des Galeries d'Anjou),4,"French fries today were lacking the freshness promised, lots  of chopped bits
hopefully next visit will taste freshly made.
The oil needs changing, tasted old and overcooked."
Wendy's (7295 des Galeries d'Anjou),3,"An OK place.  But since it's very close by the galleries anjou.  If you're eating there on the weekend, prepare to wait.  Sometimes, the service is slow.  I recommend that the staff has some grasp of ASL because there was confusion with a deaf customer.  Other than that, it's a good place to grab something to eat.  I would go only during the week and not the weekend."
Wendy's (7295 des Galeries d'Anjou),4,"Delicious food. I would not recommend their taco salad. It wasn‚Äôt good at all. However, their burgers are really good. I found a piece of wire in my burger. Thankfully, they made a new one without any issue. Excellent customer service! And, the new one was extremely good with crispy bacons."
Wendy's (7295 des Galeries d'Anjou),5,Its was a great its wasnt to load nice and clean staff was great food was great too ..great teamwork i seen while i waited to order and as i was waiting and i watched during my meal and it continued the flow was amazing thumbs up great job ladies and gents üëç
Wendy's (7295 des Galeries d'Anjou),1,I was waiting more 10 min nobody came even to ask if wanted to order ( 9h30 am ) then one guy saw me laught and stayed in back not to serve us me and the other client there !!! 3 employees talking laughting not caring if people wanted to order . Ill never go back !!!!
Boulangerie de Froment et de S√®ve (Petite Italie),4,"Very yummy, the have gigantic chocolatines. The mini one is regular size. I really like the vibe, staff is nice. The only thing I would say is they use some margarine and not all real butter so that‚Äôs the minus one star. Would definitely come back?"
Boulangerie de Froment et de S√®ve (Petite Italie),5,Wonderful croissants! Good Italian-style espresso. Nice little seating area to sit and enjoy your pastries.
Boulangerie de Froment et de S√®ve (Petite Italie),5,"Friendly staff, great products, good quality. Try the frozen ""vol au vents""/puff pastries to prepare at home! Loved their east location, but happy they are now closer to where I live in petite Italie!"
Boulangerie de Froment et de S√®ve (Petite Italie),5,I have have only tried the croissant and it‚Äôs one of the best I‚Äôve ever had in Montreal. The croissants had the perfect sweet buttery taste and were delightfully flakey. Saved in my favourites.
Boulangerie de Froment et de S√®ve (Petite Italie),3,Typically adore their croissants and baguettes but recently got a chocolatine and baguette that were both well over baked. The baguette seemed stale and was inedible the next day. Hoping it was just a fluke :/
Kosher Pizza Bar (Boul. Cavendish),1,I ordered on uber A plain slice pizza and poutine. I received a veggie slice and burnt dry poutine. Called them up to let them know the guy banged down the phone on me and refused to do anything about it.
Kosher Pizza Bar (Boul. Cavendish),5,"A few days ago I was there on Sunday.  I ordered a large pizza with cheese and mushrooms.  I paid about $ 20.  two people finished a large pizza.  thin and tasty.  clean.  fast.  good price.  the employees are polite.  He seemed a little bit a beginner, but he wasn't bad.  i love this mall.  So hos.  anyways.  I suggest you go eat pizza."
Kosher Pizza Bar (Boul. Cavendish),1,"I really dislike , orders take too much time , i‚Äôve recieved a burned poutine and i will never go back to there again"
Kosher Pizza Bar (Boul. Cavendish),1,"Price is okay, I guess its according to the area and mall‚Äôs prices. So higher than usual, but okay. However the taste is bad. Literally cardboard. All you can taste is the canned olives. Its difficult to bite/digest. The sauce and cheese are non-existent. The service is good, they‚Äôre good people. Just the pizza is honestly bad."
Kosher Pizza Bar (Boul. Cavendish),4,"Just called to make an order based on the menu posted on the very nice looking website. The young man on the other end of the line told me 'we do not do that anymore. I think prices have gone up.' When asked, simply said he did not know what the prices were except that they had generally gone up. I asked him whether the owner knew what the prices for pizza were. He said he did not know. Scratching my head here for real..is this a prank?

Note - this was edited to reflect the food. While the counter seems to be run by teenagers who are still learning how to do customer service, the pizza is actually really tasty and fresh. The prices were also reasonable - good if you have a family to feed."
Canard Caf√©,5,"My favourite coffe spot in Hochelaga ! Thanks for all the coffee you made for me, it cheered up my mornings. Sandwich Mme Canard is delicious."
Canard Caf√©,5,"We ordered double espresso and muffins, and it was tasty. Good vibes, great place for quality time."
Canard Caf√©,5,"What a great find! Cozy coffee shop with tons of homemade pastries and sweets.

The coffee was on point with the brew intensity, flavour of the beans, milk texture and temperature. The croissants and chocolatine are flaky, the brownies and cookies are decadent. What else... The atmosphere is welcoming, spacious sitting areas and the staff are nice and effective.

Still have to try their food, but I'm sure it'll be a hit based on what I had so far!"
Canard Caf√©,5,"That breakfast sandwich is huge, and it also has duck ü§© very tasty, and also very happy to learn that it has lots of pickles. That cold brew I got was huge, and it was so cheap. Thankfully they let me get a Togo cup. It looked like people ordered it for here and than sat there with their laptops all morning, which honestly looked like a really good deal."
Canard Caf√©,4,"Very nice little coffee and the food is all homemade. I tried the caramelized onions ham grilled cheese üßÄ ohhhh my my.
And the coffee ‚òïÔ∏è is perfect ü•∞
Will come back and recommend this place"
Le Marquis Castelnau,5,The croissant was amazing! I haven't had one since I went gluten free and it was so good. Bagels decent. The person also gave me a taste of a chocolate coffee cake and it was very good!
Le Marquis Castelnau,5,"Never in my life as a celiac have I come across a flakier croissant. This bakery is such a treasure, I make sure to visit every time I am in Montr√©al!"
Le Marquis Castelnau,5,"Gluten Free Heaven! As someone with celiac, this bakery was top of my list. Sadly, we went very late in the day so I do recommend ordering in advance or going early as the deliciousness sells out. The Palmiers were light and flakey and the Madeleine's were delicious with tea. I was most impressed with the pre-cooked chocolatines that I took away frozen and baked at home, to my utter delight! They were flaky goodness and not that sad, dusty taste many gluten free products have. I'm currently looking at shipping options to my city, it was that good."
Le Marquis Castelnau,5,"2 years now with a really hard diet after being diagnosed with celiac disease, so my diet is really complicated (gluten-free) and (dairy-free) i'm so sensitive to it, i still learning about this, I went in Boulangerie Le Marquis yesterday and I was almost crying after try some croissant that I bought to takeout but ended eating them before I went home because they are simply delicious, I honestly want to say THANK YOU! You guys are the best!... üëç"
Le Marquis Castelnau,5,A wonderfully baked batch of pastries overall. The lack of gluten is unnoticeable and there is no attempt to mask any taste with excessive sugar. Very moist and fluffy - a good option for anyone trying to avoid gluten.
Bernie Beigne,4,It is a treasure restaurant hidden under the viaduct. I went there for the cauliflower cake but in the end I ordered another tomato salad because I sit right in front of the working area of the chef and find the presentation is so attractive. The meal was impressive. The cauliflower cake is a spongy cake with distinguishable cauliflower texture and flavor. The tomato salad is fresh. The price is reasonable for such a high quality item but it is too high for me to enjoy a ordinary lunch.
Bernie Beigne,4,"Very cute caf√©. The service is exceptional. Everyone who works there is so friendly.

The coffee here is great. I would definetely come back for that.

For lunch, I had the kimchi nappa cabbage.  I was not too fond of that dish but I think it‚Äôs just my personal taste.

I had the chocolate and sea salt cookie which was soft and chocolatey. I was quite satisfied with my cookie."
Bernie Beigne,5,"Le Butterblume is one of the best restaurants in Canada. If I could give ten stars I would.

Sit at the bar where you can watch these amazing chefs work in the open kitchen.

The food and service are world-class. Everything is super-fresh, creative, and delicious. Their simple bread and salted butter is a can‚Äôt miss.

They also have a take-out areas for pre-packaged (yet still house-made) foods, amazing baked goods and more.

I could eat every meal here - this place is WOW."
Bernie Beigne,4,"I ordered ‚Äòfeta gnudi, chicken, lemon & thyme sauce, fresh peas, zucchini, wild garlic, parmesan‚Äô.
I found it a bit expensive. But the food was delicious. Nice service and good ambiance.
I recommend to reserve in advance.
Also you can find car parking on the street."
Bernie Beigne,5,"The food was AMAZING. Our server was AMAZING. The place is cute, good music. The appetizers were better than the main dish, but the appetizers were SO GOOD that there was just no way for the main dish to be that amazing. We were literally licking the plates. Amazing."
A&W (806 Niagara St),5,"The service at A&W is superb especially the customer service. Today, Supervisor Shilpa made sure our orders were cooked and served freshly, accurately and just on time. A&W is always our go-to restaurant!"
A&W (806 Niagara St),3,I wish I could have given this 5 stars. Food was excellent although there were mistakes to my order that were fixed promptly. They seemed to be rushing which caused the mistakes. They do focus more on the drive thru than counter customers. My order took 12 minutes at counter from time of order. Bar brew was excellent. Frozen root beer and sweet cream iced coffee was great.
A&W (806 Niagara St),2,"Unfortunately, while the server was very friendly,  out order was completely wrong.  Coffee was not right for either of us and almost tasted burnt.  No amount of sugar and cream added would lighten the coffee or take out the bitter taste.  My bacon egger had egg shell and lettuce cooked in it.  My husband ordered sausage and got bacon.   We love A&W, but this location needs to step up their game.  Fort Erie makes it perfect every time."
A&W (806 Niagara St),5,"Very good food, friendly customer service and didn't wait long either for food! 5/5 would definitely come back!"
A&W (806 Niagara St),5,"Before I begin this review, I need to make it known that the staff did ask if my family could write a review. That being said, this does not change or influence the following statement;

On April 1st, my family was in the middle of moving and we stopped in to grab a quick bite. What we experienced was service expected from a sit down restaurant, not a fast food restaurant. The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming, they came to check on us on a regular basis to make sure everything was ok.

I do not expect this from any fast food service, but the fact that they went out of their way to go above and beyond says it all, and I am beyond impressed with their service. 10 out of 10, I have no complaints. I look forward to returning to this location.

They did ask for a review, but they earned this with their incredible service. A prime example of top tier customer service."
McDonald's (Welland-Niagara),4,This location is pretty awesome.  Nice clean facility.  Super clean washroom.  Play area for children.  Patio available.  Plenty of parking.  Fast service and friendly staff.  Free WiFi.
McDonald's (Welland-Niagara),2,"The granddaughter and I went for a quick bite during errands and we ended up throwing away half our meal.
The fries were way, way to salty. These extremely salty fries were in the kids Happy Meal. Tried to swap her fries for mine but mine were just as salty. This is not the first time that this has happened. Guess I will have to head to the other McDonald's in Welland.

The service that I received from staff was pleasant, it was easy to note that the girl behind cash was not aware of some specials or gift coupon processes. She worked through it all with a large smile."
McDonald's (Welland-Niagara),1,"First time worst behavior of staff (Stacey), yelled at me at window, I ordered 2 ice cream cones, she said its only one.. i nicely said i placed order for 2 and can pay for other now.. she started making faces and yelled at me, giving attitude, turned her back on me, when i called her again she started yelling loudly, "" its not my problem, i dont need to learn from others how to behave.""
Worst customer service ever.. i hope someone teach her how to speak and behave.. she is brutal.."
McDonald's (Welland-Niagara),2,"I bring my kids every Wednesday. If you go, go early. I‚Äôve started to go closer to 430/5. No clean tables in sight. I politely asked if they had a princess peach (my daughters been anxiously awaiting it for weeks and finally saw it on someone‚Äôs try). Some girl in the background rudely said to the counter worker ‚Äútell them that‚Äôs all we have!‚Äù
I‚Äôm probably not coming back"
McDonald's (Welland-Niagara),1,"Ordered today at 9:09 to realize my entire order was made wrong, even the drinks were wrong. I called once home and they told me to bring the food back and the receipt. I waited in close to a 10 car drive thru the second time only to be told at the window to come inside so it‚Äôs fair for the rest of the line‚Ä¶ ‚Äúso THEY don‚Äôt have to wait‚Äù even though I‚Äôve had to wait for my order for an hour to be made properly??? Very contradicting.
Reilly rang through my order properly and then proceeded to charge me for bacon strips, absolutely no consideration that I have children waiting for their breakfast for nearly an hour & gas money wasted due to their mistake‚Ä¶ They also took the food back with a bite taken out of a sandwich and made me open the sandwiches at the counter. Next time if you want to make it convenient please listen when someone is ordering or give proper direction of how to proceed on the phone when you call or at least at the intercom. If I wanted to wait an hour for breakfast I would have made a gourmet one in that time at home."
Burger King (724 Niagara Street),3,I v trier √† New combo  whooper melt ..not bad..cold strawberry watermelon Juice good in this weather
Burger King (724 Niagara Street),1,"Food is always bad quality , went there for Whopper Wednesday figuring why not give it another chance. They end up charging me regular price whopper combo for $10.50. I asked them for fresh fries and they tell me to park. I realize I was charged too much so I walk in to get my order and to question the receipt. They stand there saying well we would have to refund you and re ring you in for the whopper Wednesday deal which they didn‚Äôt want to spend the 2 minutes doing so so they offered me a free pie. I‚Äôm like okay but make sure the fries are fresh please. I literally watch and no new baskets of fries come up and they are acting as if they are waiting on fresh fries but then they scoop the old fries that have been sitting in the heater for probably 45 minutes or so. They think everyone is stupid but Burger King is declining. Especially this location. The new St Catherine‚Äôs location ok Welland Ave is amazing. Ask for fresh fries and they oblige. They also give you the whopper Wednesday deal without question."
Burger King (724 Niagara Street),5,Great location and the renovation is top notch.. super friendly staff and clean.  Will come back
Burger King (724 Niagara Street),2,"I usually have good experiences with this place but tonight was the final straw. I ordered my meal. At least 10 mins go by. No problem usually the wait for fast food. But then the skip the dishes guy arrives, pretty much the staff stop what they were doing and did the skip order first before the line of customers inside. There was one kid that got there before me, they put down his food, then they immediately put it back. Please focus on the people that were there before the skip driver."
Burger King (724 Niagara Street),1,"-11:30pm July19 2023- there was 8 kitchen employees working last night, none of them could understand me speaking in english. all of them we're standing together holding hands and they failed to get my fountain drink order correctly. these employees here do not like to work this is very common here."
Hasty Market (554 Niagara St.),5,"My visit on Sunday Nov. 17th 2019 was 9 out of 10. Clean place and friendly staff. Service was quick and efficient.  menu was large and visible easy to understand. The aroma of the baked breads was enticing with all the fixings in open view. Sandwich baristas wore gloves, Thank you.  My sub and my families was perfect."
Hasty Market (554 Niagara St.),5,Awesome subs! They don't Implode.
Hasty Market (554 Niagara St.),5,Only had multi grain but actually liked it and it was soft here. Everytime I get stuck with that bread anywhere else it's like chewing leather. But was good here.
Hasty Market (554 Niagara St.),5,Nothing better than a subway sub with whatever pop your heart can mix.
Hasty Market (554 Niagara St.),1,"I've been to this location a few times and they've always been relatively positive. I just ordered through the app for the first time and I received a burnt sandwich with no meat or cheese. I ordered a steak & cheese, but instead I seemed to have received a veggie sub. Unfortunately they were closed by the time I got home and ate, otherwise I would've gone back and asked what the hell was that? What a waste of money, I want a refund"
Tim Hortons (2 Tremont Dr),2,"This Tim's skimpy on meat. Orders a sandwich from there that had two pieces of turkey on it. Went to hartzel road Tim's. They still give out 5 pieces of turkey on the sandwich. Don't waste your money at tremont Tim's. Top photo tremont. Bottom photo hartzel. The person who owns tremont Tim's is either a cheap clown, or is unaware this is happening. Although the lady at the counter told me it was policy at this store. So I'm assuming cheap clown"
Tim Hortons (2 Tremont Dr),3,"Bought the  ""NEW loaded cilantro lime chicken bowl"".
Staff skimps on the portions.
Picture on menu shoes a full bowl brimming to the top. The actual serving in the bowl is below the lip of the bowl. Basically misleading advertisements meant to seduce you into buying the product and shortchanged you on product .
Food tasted good but was shortchanged on quantity ."
Tim Hortons (2 Tremont Dr),4,One of the better tims locations in St. Catharines. Service was fast alongside a nice overall atmosphere.
Tim Hortons (2 Tremont Dr),1,"Would do 0 stars if I could. Seems like all the good staff is gone. The staff there is horrible doesn't listen to orders... have to repeat myself 5 to 8 times for them to type it in correctly.  My drink is not complicated either! (Legit... steeped tea with skim milk) . Horrible customer service when I call. Last straw was an order was placed, all 3 items given were wrong,  I called and told them they said my name would be on the wall, went over to get the correct item replacements and I was told I was not on the wall.. was told I could use the drive thru for the replacement order, the girls at the window/box demanded I go inside.... rude. Horrible.. snotty.. my entire family (multiple daily visits each) are not returning here."
Tim Hortons (2 Tremont Dr),1,Ordered the last chocolate toasted coconut donut on the shelf today and paid for it.  While waiting for my order I saw an employee took the last donut and went inside.  I was told there wasn‚Äôt any toasted coconut left.  Ended up getting a croissant instead.  What happened to my donut?!
Subway (13210 Lundy's Lane),5,I go to this subway location on a regular basis. The staff are super friendly and they quite often remember my previous order from the last time I was in. All the fixing are fresh and the subs are made fast. One of the best Subways I've ever been to. A+++
Subway (13210 Lundy's Lane),5,"Honestly the girls in here are amazing! They are very kind and know my order when they see me!! Highly recommended this subway! The subs are always good, fresh bread... my favorite subway!!"
Subway (13210 Lundy's Lane),5,"Clean location, great service, friendly staff. Raman is awesome, always remembers my order and nails it everytime. Best Subway location in Niagara!"
Subway (13210 Lundy's Lane),5,"Whenever I visit this location I know what I‚Äôll get - nice staff that serves fresh veggies and cookies with a smile on their face. Love the Texmex bread and pecan caramel cookies, hope they stay on the menu for a long time! üòÖ"
Subway (13210 Lundy's Lane),5,"Go here everyday service is great, know my sub before i even walk in, very polite all around great much loveüëçüèΩ"
Sunset Grill (130 Highway 20 E),5,"The best service!!
We started coming here a few months ago as we were new to the area and the staff here is so friendly and welcoming.
The food is fast and hot! You won‚Äôt regret coming here.
Even when it was busy on Mother‚Äôs Day we got a table right away üëèüèª"
Sunset Grill (130 Highway 20 E),5,I had a great experience at this location! It took a little long to receive our bill but it could have been getting busier at that time. It was nice and clean but at the time I went the sun was a little intense. The bacon was huge and everything was cooked very well! I would go again!
Sunset Grill (130 Highway 20 E),5,"My boyfriend and I frequent this Sunset Grill and 90% of the time we have Lynn as our server. She is great every single time! Always so friendly and helpful, excellent customer service! On top of that the food is consistently delicious and fresh. 10/10 recommend :)"
Sunset Grill (130 Highway 20 E),5,"Food was excellent, we had patty the server and she was fantastic. So friendly and if you want to see them make your food it's an open kitchen so it's nice to see the people making your food"
Sunset Grill (130 Highway 20 E),2,"Toast was buttered cold, so it was just a layer of cold butter on hard bread. Home fries looked like they would be cruchy but were so soggy. And cold. Couldn't eat them. And the place is more expensive than others in the area. Definitely won't return"
Stacked Pancake & Breakfast House (Welland),5,"Ever since the first time I went here, it has been amazing every time. I get a mix of takeout and dine in. Service is always great. The staff there work really hard and are always showing a smile even when you can see they are swamped. Online ordering, you can only get gluten-free free plain of their breakfast food, but if you dine-in, you can ask for anything I've found, except for the crepes, to be gluten-free, and you just pay an upcharge, it's amazing. I usually get the french toast with strawberry NY cream cheese toppingüòç"
Stacked Pancake & Breakfast House (Welland),4,"Wow some big portions huh!!!
The food and service were great! I had a ""Healthy choice"" and I enjoyed it a lot. üòÑ
I would recommend it any day you don't feel like cooking üòéüòã"
Stacked Pancake & Breakfast House (Welland),5,"Great food & service. Busy place so you might have to wait a bit for a table but turnover is pretty fast so you won‚Äôt wait long. My only complaint is that I ordered chocolate chip pancakes and was expecting chocolate chips inside the pancakes, but they were just dropped on top with a few on the bottom. Otherwise, great experience."
Stacked Pancake & Breakfast House (Welland),5,Stacked on Niagara St. in Welland is our FAV! Today Larissa served us. She is such a sweetheart. Everything came perfectly as ordered and was delicious  as usual. Thank you to all their staff at this location. (This is the best Stacked location by far) See you next time!
Stacked Pancake & Breakfast House (Welland),5,"This place is fantastic! I had the Benedict Hash and they glady substituted the peameal bacon for sausage (cause I don't like Canadian bacon üôÑüòî). The Hollandaise sause was one of the best I had! The portion was super large and I definitely could not eat it all. This breakfast was also decently priced. My only complaint is that it is so popular you may have to wait a bit for your food, but the staff fill your coffee!"
IHOP (7514 Lundy'S Lane),5,Food was amazing! Our waitress was alone and super attentive and helpful. Best pancakes I've had in a long time
IHOP (7514 Lundy'S Lane),1,"We were there after travelling 60 km reached 8am in the morning, but still closed,door was opened, we went inside and a lady asked how you get inside, she surprised us the kitchen is still closed,our kitchen girl coming late.This is how they are running the business. We invited our friends there for breakfast, very embracing moment for us."
IHOP (7514 Lundy'S Lane),4,"As a family from the UK we've loved IHOP when we've been to the US.
The quality of the food and service is fabulous in the Lundy's Lane restaurant.
The only niggle is the price. At least 50% more than I paid in Tampa last year so, lost a ‚≠ê"
IHOP (7514 Lundy'S Lane),5,canada food was different  everything tasted better than ihop in the us states
IHOP (7514 Lundy'S Lane),4,"Good discount for locals, just ask them to remove the tourist tax if you are from the Niagara region. The portion of the omlette dishes can be too much sometimes for one person and can feed two people very well. The strawberry milkshake was very tasty and filling. Overall the service was pretty fast compared to how busy they were around 12pm. Not my regular breakfast place but I like to visit this place once in a while :)"
P√ºr & Simple (St. Catharines),5,Delicious food! A little on the expensive side but definitely worth it! Our server was really accommodating and kind! Overall terrific place for breakfast/brunch!
P√ºr & Simple (St. Catharines),2,"Honestly, it a okay for me. I personally just love the atmosphere and service but the food I‚Äôve specifically gotten just didn‚Äôt hit the spot‚Ä¶ the first time I came here I got the Cinnabon and one of the drinks ( pretty good) the Cinnabon on the other hand tasted like oil‚Ä¶. I was a bit confused on how they made it for it to taste like onions and oil. The second time I went there, I got the waffles and chicken with fries instead of
Potatoes. When I got the fries, it came out orange brownish and I was confused and thought it was sweet potatoes but they said it wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ it tasted bitter, it just looked like they haven‚Äôt changed their oil but then I decided to change it back to the potatoes and it was also the same so that confirmed it for me. The waffles was pretty good but the chicken was stiff and small..just overall disappointed."
P√ºr & Simple (St. Catharines),5,The food was absolutely delicious! And the service was great. Whenever I visit the Niagara Falls area I make sure to grab a meal here.
P√ºr & Simple (St. Catharines),5,Great spot for breakfast! Service was amazing and OMG! The food was so fresh and delicious! I‚Äô ll definitely come back soon!
P√ºr & Simple (St. Catharines),5,"Shannon is an amazing server. She was so kind and went above and beyond for us. I always have an amazing experience here, got to see Uzoma and Vanessa as a host today, they have such positive energy and always smiling. Will definitely coming back soon."
Domenic's On 20,5,"I've been to this Domenics a number of times, usually for breakfast. The staff is friendly and attentive.  Orders have always been correct and delicious. Food is brought to you as you ordered it. My favorite dish is the Waffle Supreme...its huge and served with whole pieces of berries. Other breakfast dishes are very good as well with decent proportions. I'll continue to go here. Thanks!"
Domenic's On 20,5,Delicious and huge portion sizes! The chipotle mayo was great. Had an awesome kick to it. Definitely recommend the southern fried chicken sandwich. My boyfriend really enjoyed his chipotle burger as well. Will definitely be back!
Domenic's On 20,5,"We had the honor of being the first wedding ever hosted here - (50 guests).
It was amazing! Food, atmosphere, and service were second-to-none, all guests were very impressed!
Special thank you to Mima for being amazing to work with from start to finish. Thank you so much for making our day extra special.

If you are looking for a chic venue for smaller wedding, speak to Mima, she will look after you!
Food, service, atmosphere was exactly what we expected, thank you so much!
whether a wedding or just a great spot to eat, Dominic's on the 20 is a great spot."
Domenic's On 20,5,Stopped her for a bite to eat on my way home from Dover.. It was great. Service was top notch and the portion size what very  large and enough left over for lunch the following day!! Highly recommend stopping here if you are passing by and looking for food or even planing on going out to eat!!!
Domenic's On 20,5,"We were at the restaurant for a birthday party with a party of 26. The staff were wonderful, the 2 tables we had were set up so nicely.  Even though we had a preset menu of 3 different entree choices, they were accommodating, if someone wanted something off the menu they could and did order.  The food came out on time so we all ate together.  The food was made to perfection and so tasty. Thank you to Mimma and her staff for making our party a success."
Williams Fresh Cafe (Dorchester),4,"Overall it‚Äôs very good, place was clean and staff were welcoming and pleasant.  Food was good and portions size is filling and good. Service was good and place has easy access to QEW highway.  As for price it was reasonable and size of waffle portion was large.  I wish they take little bit care of overall presentation.  Washroom need more attention and regular maintenance as they said the cleanness of washroom is a good indicator of the place and food."
Williams Fresh Cafe (Dorchester),4,"We wanted a quick breakfast and a place to take a couple of work calls and send some emails. We called ahead to check if they have WiFi and free parking and they did.

Pleasantly surprised that it was such a big place. Serves breakfast all day.

We ordered chicken quesadilla and a breakfast bagel sandwich and both were great.

Coffee for takeaway was also good.

Free brownie if you download their app."
Williams Fresh Cafe (Dorchester),5,"Heard it from friend‚Ä¶..Decided to go there and it was fab!! I ordered Pirogies, Mocha and Yogurt with Berries!!! Everything was absolutely perfect. Will go there soon again"
Williams Fresh Cafe (Dorchester),1,"I really love the cheesy bacon and egg wrap but when I had it today, it was awful. The bacon was chewy and hard. There was also a weird substance like sausage meat but not quite. I usually don't have a problem here but I was disappointed today.

I decided to give it another try. The food has gone so downhill. I had a simple cheese croissant with egg and bacon and it was doughy and soggy!! Like how does that happen?? I'm very disappointed now. I don't think I will order food here anymore."
Williams Fresh Cafe (Dorchester),5,"I am happy that we decided to go there. Sitting area and delicious food gave us the feeling of perfect local place which we wanted to feel like. We ordered small cappuccinos, baked veggies sandwich but received veggie wrap cuz of some miscommunication, I think; and waffles with chocolate chip n marshmallows, vanilla ice cream. We really enjoyed everything. Moreover, the girl who served us was so sweet n nice. Williams fresh caf√© is on my + list now."
Cinnabon (Vansickle),1,"Paid for two six inch subs both were supposed to come with lettuce mayo and cheese one was also to have bacon as stated on menu , I received only tomato and onion on both , no one answered my several attempted phone calls nor when I returned to the store no one was at the counter , left with incorrect order out 17 dollars

Would not recommend"
Cinnabon (Vansickle),1,"It was horrible after waiting forever we were finally given our food, a bag that had been sitting out on the counter for at least 10-15 min they just didn‚Äôt call our number. The food was cold already when we opened it. The marinara pasta had a large chunk of meat in it. I must say it was a horrible dining experience(I wasn‚Äôt expecting much but I was left thinking how McDonald‚Äôs like some other Walmarts  would have been way cheaper and better even as a vegetarian) When I asked if there was a way to speak to a manager or leave a complaint I was told there was not and also told my food was not the bag that I was given that had been sitting on the counter for a while."
Cinnabon (Vansickle),5,We just discovered this place in Walmart! It‚Äôs such a cool concept and the guy that served us was so helpful and friendly. Would totally come back again. Fun experience and then drink was delicious (cookies and cream milkshake). They made it fresh and even customized it! My daughter was very happy.
Cinnabon (Vansickle),1,"Worst meal we've ever ordered. Every item was messed up and I even found a fly in my salad!! Items were missing from the order, salad came with no dressing, perogies came with no sour cream. The churros were over cooked and dry just terrible tasting food all around. Skip-the-Dishes had to fefund us the enite order it was so bad and that's still not enough. Tried calling there too but their number doesn't go through. Worst place to get food ever!! With I could give it 0 stars."
Cinnabon (Vansickle),1,"They should've been out of business by now.  Worst food. Worst service. Worst every way.

Do us a favour and close your shop."

Cora D√©jeuners et Diners  (St. Catharines),5,I always love Cora's and they never disappoint. Had the most amazing service today too. Ashley was fantastic. attentive and friendly and made the meal even better!
Cora D√©jeuners et Diners  (St. Catharines),4,"Food was good, a little more dollar wise but worth the price.

The hollandaise sauce on the eggs benidict was very thick and rich, one of the best eggs benidict I've had.

The chocolate chip pancakes were good but a bit pricey.

Overall a good go to place for breakfast."
Cora D√©jeuners et Diners  (St. Catharines),2,Extremely slow service‚Ä¶there was 8 tables in total and 5 servers working‚Ä¶waited 15 minutes to be seated. When there were multiple tables open‚Ä¶arrived at 11:15 and finally at 11:45 I ordered my food‚Ä¶servers are extremely forgetful‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt find the breakfast that good‚Ä¶omelette was extremely bland very a little sprinkle of cheese‚Ä¶definitely not worth the price or wait time‚Ä¶
Cora D√©jeuners et Diners  (St. Catharines),5,"I‚Äôve dropped in for breakfast a few times while in town for my son‚Äôs university exams and this location is excellent, with above and beyond experience from the greeting, to seating, food prep, timing and delivery, wait staff checking in and ensuring perfection‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt recommend anything very often publicly but this location consistently out performs expectations and it‚Äôs so nice to see pride in work and efforts. Special thanks to Heather the server and her excellent team."
Cora D√©jeuners et Diners  (St. Catharines),5,"We were visiting Niagara falls and while looking for local places to eat, I came across Cora's. It was amazing!!! Nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. I got an omelet (spinach and cheddar with goat cheese added), fruit crepe and kale mango smoothie. When I checked out they gave me some maple fudge. All of it tasted wonderful! I will come back to this place for sure! A really pleasant experience!"

Skip-the-Dishes had to fefund us the enite order it was so bad and that's still not enough. Tried calling there too but their number doesn't go through. Worst place to get food ever!! With I could give it 0 stars."
Crepe Delicious (Vansickle),1,"They should've been out of business by now.  Worst food. Worst service. Worst every way.

Do us a favour and close your shop."
WIND Japanese and Thai (King St.),3,Awesome place. Great atmosphere. We had a great spot and the food was delicious. The only thing was while eating the red curry chicken there was a piece of plastic/glass or something maybe even a shell. I brought it to the servers attention and they just said it shouldn't have been in there and took it. No other mention of it.
WIND Japanese and Thai (King St.),5,"This is our favorite place for Sushi in the Niagara region. Their food is always nicely prepared, good quality and tastes great. The staff is always friendly and attentive. We will continue to be returning customers."
WIND Japanese and Thai (King St.),5,Amazing food and service and ambiance! Dat was our server and he was so nice and attentive and helpful! We love coming to Wind!
WIND Japanese and Thai (King St.),5,"We came in this restaurant just 20 minutes before kitchen closes. We were in group of 15 people and we just had those 20 min to order everything we wanted. It was crazy how fast they served us and how friendly they were with us helping with everything we asked. The staff is very polite and caring. Saturday evening it was expensive, our bill for the group came to 650$, but totally worth it. Thank you so much for a great experience!"
WIND Japanese and Thai (King St.),5,"First time coming here and it certainly won‚Äôt be my last!!!
When we got there, the host was very welcoming, we had a robot show us our table!!! It was the coolest and cutest thing ever. Our server was super friendly and polite as well!! I didn‚Äôt get her name, but she was very attentive, always making sure that we were okay, if we had everything we needed and we had our water glasses filled without having to ask. All of the other staff were very nice too! I loved that the menu has so many different options to choose from and the food was absolutely delicious. I‚Äôve never seen an all you can eat sushi restaurant with a prosciutto roll, deep fried ice cream AND cr√®me br√ªl√©e before?! This restaurant by far has the best dessert menu!!! Highly recommend Wind to all sushi lovers out there!!"
Rollzup ice cream,5,"We visited Pho Bowl through word of mouth on April 27, a day before my sister's birthday. The food was amazing! I ordered Vermicelli with Grilled Pork, Spring Rolls and Minced Shrimps on Sugar Cane, which was soooo delicious that I finished the whole dish! My sister almost had the same sans the minced shrimps while our tour guides shared Pho noodle soup and some Grilled Pork Chop, Chicken and Fried Egg on Rice. Unlike some Vietnamese/Asian places around here, we found the food at Pho Bowl of good quality, nourishing, fresh and simply delicious. We met the owner, Ouanh, and thanked her for the great cuisine and wonderful service. They keep coming around if we needed tea refills or water, or napkins even. We liked the very serviceable Filipina waitress who we thought was either Thai or Vietnamese ( surprise!). We recommend with gusto!"
Rollzup ice cream,5,"I‚Äôve have Vietnamese food right across Canada, and I have to say this was by far the best I‚Äôve had. Staff was wonderful, portions are huge  and flavour of the food is exquisite. Definitely made the trip to Niagara Falls worth it !"
Rollzup ice cream,4,Pretty good food with good prices!  (I ate half a spring roll before taking the picture).
Rollzup ice cream,3,"Pho tasted okay, spring rolls were good though. Portion was a bit on the smaller end, I also think they may have mixed up my order as I ordered the special but came out only with rare beef. This can satisfy your craving but I have had better in the niagara region."
Rollzup ice cream,5,Amazing experience with the boss. Was very welcoming! The food came out great and fresh. Every dish was amazing
Pho Ngon,5,"Delicious spot to come across if you're in the area! The dish I ordered was 205 (less spicy) and the rice was the chicken fried rice with shrimp, vegetables. Both were delicious and they are quick to bring the food! Prices are great for the portions. I ordered a medium and it was huge! This is a dine-in as well as take out. So it's nice to be able to sit down and enjoy the food. Washrooms are clean which is a plus I'd say! They also give nice hot green tea as soon as you sit. It felt so cozy."
Pho Ngon,5,"Summary: Very cheap food and huge quantities. Fresh tasting, and always having room for walk-ins. My meal pictured was roughly $12-$14 (I went here a month ago so I can‚Äôt recall the price too specifically).

I‚Äôve always loved Vietnamese food and back when I lived in Saskatchewan I would always visit a particular Vietnamese restaurant for several years. It still is my go-to. After moving to St. Catharines I‚Äôve looked everywhere for something similar and this has to be the gem!

Environment: Very comfy and a sense of family-owned. When you walk into some restaurants you can tell right away if it is family owned due to the warmth of the server‚Äôs behaviour and the atmosphere - this is just that. Lots of seating for you to have privacy and enough for a walk-in on a busy day.

Options: there are PLENTY of options. If I remember correctly, there were like over 60 items on the menu and all the food ranged from $5-$25 with the bulk falling around $14. As you can tell from my photo, the portions are large!

I totally recommend coming by here. Won‚Äôt hurt your wallet and the food is amazing."
Pho Ngon,3,"Good place to try. I was in here and ordered broken rice with pork chop and chicken. They did grilled the way I like it. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, is just that the flavour was very dull."
Pho Ngon,5,"Trying the newest item make my mind fly away, everything is fresh and yummy. This dish is suitable for group of 3 or more depending how much topping that you ordered. We had to take away some home because we couldn‚Äôt we finish it. It was a good experience."
Pho Ngon,5,"Incredibly tasty Vietnamese food. We've ordered from this restaurant a few times and the food has been consistently good. Very flavourful, great portions. The rare beef soup broth is just to die for. It's probably the best I've had."
Pizza Pizza (Lake St. and Nihan Dr.),5,"Pizza Pizza on Lake Street is a true gem of a restaurant that offers some of the most delicious and satisfying pizza you'll ever taste. The cozy little restaurant has a warm and welcoming atmosphere, and the staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming. From the moment you step inside, you're greeted with the mouth-watering aroma of fresh-baked pizza, and each slice is a burst of flavor in your mouth. The crust is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, with just the right amount of thickness to hold all the toppings without getting soggy. The wide variety of toppings to choose from includes fresh vegetables, high-quality meats, and an array of cheeses. The service is exceptional, with the staff going above and beyond to ensure that each customer gets exactly what they want. They're always happy to recommend their favorite pizza combinations or customize a pie to your liking. Overall, Pizza Pizza on Lake Street is a must-visit for anyone looking for great food and exceptional service in a cozy atmosphere."
Pizza Pizza (Lake St. and Nihan Dr.),5,"The best part about pizza pizza is that it's open late, and they don't judge ‚ô•Ô∏è forever sliding thru at 1:30am gimme that spicy vegan chicken sandwich"
Pizza Pizza (Lake St. and Nihan Dr.),5,Great customer service and very clean restaurant. We ordered the pickup special in large. It was fresh and great tasting. Glad to see them have halal options.
Pizza Pizza (Lake St. and Nihan Dr.),3,"The staff goofed up while processing my order payment (again) and made no attempt to resolve it. The staff member then tried to blame me for not giving him the information even though I did... He just wasn't listening. If you mess up dealing with a customer, then own it and fix it! Don't put it on the customer and expect them to just take it! Nothing will send customers to the competition faster!

The pizza itself was mediocre, light on toppings and had a ridiculous amount of sauce on it. (Not in a good way)

I've ordered from this location many times and it's really hit or miss. Prices keep going up and up, but the pizzas keep getting skimpier and skimpier at this location.

I take no pleasure in leaving less than stellar reviews. With many, many years of experience in the restaurant industry, I know it can be a rough go sometimes. There's no reason to put it on your customers though!"
Pizza Pizza (Lake St. and Nihan Dr.),5,One of my friend suggested me this restaurant wow was very good experience. I had a medium pepperoni pizza. I have never tasted a pepperoni pizza quite like this. The quality and quantity were much better. Very clean restaurant and friendly staff. 100% recommended!!!
MA Chinese Cuisine,5,"What an amazing restaurant! Came here with family, first thing is their decor and interior, it‚Äôs pretty good! A little dark but still a nice place to be. Next is their service, I think it was fabulous, the servers were very polite and friendly. The food came pretty quickly.

The main part, the food, it was all delicious. We tried quite a few dishes and loved all of it. Definitely worth a visit!"
MA Chinese Cuisine,5,"We've been meaning to come here for quite some time. Tonight was the night.. and it was amazing! Jasmine, our server, was lovely. The atmosphere and food were fantastic. I'd highly recommend the deep fried tofu with pepper salt, dim sum, and the beef buns.

Overall, a great experience. We will return."
MA Chinese Cuisine,5,The dim sum is perfection! Each dish is thoughtfully prepared and tastes fresh and unique. Great drink selection and fantastic service. I highly recommend saving room for the sesame dessert balls... authentic and incredibly delicious.
MA Chinese Cuisine,4,"Atmosphere feels like dining in a high-class restaurant, with relaxing music, great service, and very clean individual washrooms.
The HK-styled dim sum (Spring rolls, glutinous rice, dumplings) are done almost perfectly. Will come back again for sure!"
MA Chinese Cuisine,5,"Good Chinese Fine Dining. Food is good, Taste is relatively light compared to other Chinese restaurants. I tried fired rice, which is too dry. Dim sum is very good. I would recommend this restaurant to Western people who want to try one good Chinese dining.
I came for a early dinner around 5pm. The restaurant accepted the walkin. It has more than enough of staff. The discs came quickly. The deco is also quite artistic. Just don't look from outside."
Passage to India Restaurant,5,"Great food, great service, reasonable prices. I highly recommend the garlic naan and the butter chicken"
Passage to India Restaurant,5,"The food is beyond amazing, the service is great, I've had Indian before, but this palace takes you to whole new experience. All plates are clearly explained and you leave with a peaceful sensation."
Passage to India Restaurant,5,Best place for Desi halal Indian food in Niagara region. Their Homemade Kulfi is a must try!!!
Passage to India Restaurant,4,"We just happened upon this place while walking down to the falls.... It certainly is not an 'attractive' restaurant, but the food was really delicious. The chicken came sizzling to the table, and the portion sizes where very good. They also had a good selection of Indian desserts including Rasmalai. Extremely good value!"
Passage to India Restaurant,1,"Well I order chicken briyani on Uber but when I recived it, it‚Äôs totally tasteless and I didn‚Äôt eat it . The food quality is low I also receive hair in my food . Totally the wastage of money sir or mam ."
Three Uncles Korean Chicken (Glenridge),2,"I really wanted to like this place, im a huge fan of korean food and wanted to find a delicious place to buy korean takeout from. I gave the place 2 chances but each time i ordered i was disappointed. Investing in a really good sweet/spicy sauce is important. Instant tteokbokki from the packet is better."
Three Uncles Korean Chicken (Glenridge),2,"I ordered the five piece chicken tender combo with two extra sodas yesterday. Not a big fan of the flavor of the chicken, which might just be because I'm used to fast food American chicken, and this was my first time having Korean chicken. I didn't like the taste at all, but the breading was good. I feel like the oil the tenders are fried in is different than what I'm used to. I liked the French fries more than the chicken."
Three Uncles Korean Chicken (Glenridge),4,"I ordered pick up through Skip the dishes, food was ready on time and fresh. Though a little pricey, the Korean style corn dog was delicious. I also tried the Fried Chicken. It is spicy but pretty good. I had the sweet and spicy fries with it and the dip is fantastic. Overall pretty good."
Three Uncles Korean Chicken (Glenridge),5,"I placed my order through Uber eats and the food was delicious. All of the instructions were thoroughly followed, the packaging was pretty good. There were so many bad reviews on Google. So, I was hesitant but the Uber rating were good and nevertheless I am pleased with my order. Will definitely try again. :)"
Three Uncles Korean Chicken (Glenridge),2,Ordered thru skip‚Ä¶still prefer my kfc or Popeyes over this‚Ä¶checked out their menu and very over priced for their dim sum. 1 hour for fried chicken is a bit too long for me‚Ä¶fryer oil seems a bit dark as the chicken looks very dark
BIG TUNA ASIAN CUISINE,5,"First time here and I loved it. Did the lunch as it is cheaper. Lots of variety on the menu, food was super fresh and hot. Loved the rolls, shrimp tempura, the beef broccoli was the best! Wait staff friendly and kitchen staff quick! Will be back."
BIG TUNA ASIAN CUISINE,1,"Worst food I have ever eaten. This place not only got me sick, but also forced us to eat and ‚Äúfinish‚Äù the food that did  not look edible to begin with. We ordered the Thai Green Curry (image attached) which evidently had alot of artificial food colour and had NO CURRY . It literally looked like a wet toilet paper!! We asked for the manager but nobody came. The server Jeff said we could complain all we want but if we left food and ‚Äúwasted‚Äù it, we‚Äôd be charged $9. The crab tempura had a couple of shrimp shells in it too. This was more like a nightmare and they wouldn‚Äôt let us leave until this pathetic food was finished. This food deserved to be flushed down the drain. NEVER GOING BACK! If you‚Äôre reading this review, spare yourself the horror and go to Wind or East Izakaya instead"
BIG TUNA ASIAN CUISINE,5,Thank you VERY much!! Amazing fresh delicious food. We ordered for our daughter's University grad. Huge portions for the party platters. Highly recommend!!!
BIG TUNA ASIAN CUISINE,5,Firstly I want to say we are regular customers for wind and east (every week we go) until we try big tuna. My family loves this place. My mother in law and grandma loves the spicy and sour soup here and both my husband and I loves the sakana rolls and crazy rolls. Best rolls in town! And every time our server is Jeff! Very friendly and helpful gentleman. We are big eaters and will always go back!
BIG TUNA ASIAN CUISINE,2,"Sushi rolls were tiny and didn't taste fresh at all. The non sushi dishes were dry and bland as well. Overall disappointing experience with the food and I wouldn't recommend going here. Nothing tasted gross, it just wasn't good. I will say the staff was all great so not their fault!
There are lots of other better options for sushi in the area. I definitely feel like our money was wasted."
KFC (295 4th ave West),1,I don‚Äôt know how you can screw up the Colonels recipe but this location did. Ordered takeout and should have looked in the bag before I drove off. Missing the dips for the popcorn chicken. The chicken in the dinner for 2 was so greasy you could have lubricated your vehicle. Never again. Especially with the cost of this stuff nowadays absolutely never never again.
KFC (295 4th ave West),5,"I always make the drive to this KFC rather than any other one in the city. Always super clean , the best chicken pieces. I've noticed some are different than others. Once they didn't have one of my options so added a free side of popcorn chicken. Friendly and quick and accurate. This KFC is the superior KFC in St. Catharines."
KFC (295 4th ave West),3,"Staff were friendly and apologetic for the very slow service due to lack of staff (expect to wait at least 25 minutes from entry for an order made at the counter).
Food was ok. Was missing a side from the box meal and there was an extreme amount of mayo on the sandwich.
Management has decided to discontinue potato salad as a side at this location."
KFC (295 4th ave West),1,"Me and my family waited in line witch we were next one up, and the guy helped out the drive-through as the manager requested?be they had 2 cars?  So it took me 15mins for my blood to boil and we walked out, poor management there, so we ended up and a better KFC in beamsville less staff and better service"
KFC (295 4th ave West),3,"Ordered chicken tenders combo, was told to pull up and wait, waited for 10mins and when I recieved my food it was cold and very small portion ,no dipping sauce will not come back!!!!"
Wings Block,5,"Love this place.
Little hidden gem.
Prices are great for such large portions!
I went on opening day & our waitress Charlie was amazing and so accommodating.
Spicy garlic parm & honey maple wings were my first try.
So good.
Tonight hot wings & the chicken avocado and ceasar salad & again all the staff were so amazing and friendly.
Will definitely be back again."
Wings Block,5,Incredible food. Tasty wings. Many flavors and great portions.  The food in town if Bluestar is closed. We will be pack for sure when in town.
Wings Block,4,"Great Wings, very large and cooked perfectly. Friendly staff! Was not disappointed. The only drawback is that there was so many flavours to choose from it made deciding difficult."
Wings Block,5,1000X Yes! White meat with generous portions. Very reasonably priced. Love the chicken sandwich and chicken strips. This place is my last 5 Uber orders!
Wings Block,5,"Very pleased trying Wing Block for the first time. Great prices, food was delicious, and we were pleased with the vented takeout boxes, kept the wings crispy! We will definitely be eating here again!"
The Fry,5,"We ordered boneless chicken cheesling and seafood noodle soup, forgot to take a picture of the soup but it was amazing. Wasn‚Äôt too salty or anything and chicken was seasoned top notch, crispy and flavorful. Everybody must try! :))

The atmosphere was very cozy and decent server. Thanks for answering all of my questions as well!! We spent really good time."
The Fry,5,"bb.q chicken could never. Hands down the BEST Korean fried chicken I‚Äôve ever had. Free Wifi, amazing service and the quality control of the food is superb. We found this spot while at the outlets and decided to give it a try. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try Korean fried chicken and I will come here again whenever I make a trip to Niagara. Even the water was bussin fr."
The Fry,5,"Food was so delicious I had to come back again the next day and leave another review. I am writing this review as I‚Äôm experiencing the new flavors and overall, the Rose rice cakes and corn cheese are my favorites. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for Korean cuisine as you cannot find the quality and flavor anywhere else. The water is still bussin fr."
The Fry,5,"Woah, the seafood rice cake dish is so good, the seafood was tender, the rice cake was soft and pillowy and the veggies were crunchy. The chicken was super crispy and flavorful. I wish I picked half kalbi half original though since the spicy sauce one was also sweet. I also love the pickled radish as a palette cleanser. Definitely go back again."
The Fry,5,Genuine Korean-style fried chickens! Sauce seems&tastes legit too. Loved the complimentary corn dish after ordering.
Landmark Cinemas (St. Catharines),4,"In door shopping center.

Clean, but not quite easy to navigate for 1st time visitor. Quite big as well, and we got lost during first visit.

It is a little outdated, but you can find everything you need, to shop or to eat.

Plenty of parking and all kinds of stores."
Landmark Cinemas (St. Catharines),4,"You get used to the amount of people. Not as much as the bigger cities, but it's a popular place due to the stores inside the mall, the cafeteria, and the theatre. I tend to go from the mall to the plaza across the street and vice versa. The food court will always be the busiest. Come here if you have money though. 20 bucks will only get you so far if you need something specific, so sales or rewards cards are definitely a must here."
Landmark Cinemas (St. Catharines),5,Been going to this mall since I was a little boy.  Not so much now that I live out of the city.  I have seen all the changes and developments.  I would say its at its best.  Its crazy to see some stores are still there 20 years later.  Memories üòä
Landmark Cinemas (St. Catharines),1,"Went to the mall on 06/24/23 with my wife and two young children. We have a puppy and called courtesy desk before going and asked if dogs were allowed. They said yes! We have a toy poodle that weights maybe 8 lbs. we entered by Winners and an aggressive security guard approached my wife and daughter and said no dogs allowed. When I saw the situation I approached security guard and told him we called and he said no they are not allowed. I told him about courtesy desk and he said they were wrong. I asked him if they represent the mall
And he said YES! I asked him to show me where it says no dogs. He said on each entrance on doors. I said let‚Äôs go check because I said it doesn‚Äôt. He thought I became confrontational and radioed for back up. I laughed at him and said because I‚Äôm questioning you, you need back up? He wouldn‚Äôt go to the door to provide it. Then when I continued questioning him he threatened to have me trespassed. I said for what? Asking to prove your policy he said it‚Äôs mall policy and we could go back to security office and he‚Äôd show me. I called him out on this and said let‚Äôs go. He said well that‚Äôs a waste of time. I said that‚Äôs for me to decide. His supervisor showed up and was very professional and de-escalated the situation by taking the time to share with me that dogs were not allowed in the mall unless service dogs. She agreed that courtesy desk was misinformed that represents the mall. Winners also allows dogs and the manger was all over our dog petting her and kissing her. She said that she would have to speak to her. Then my wife went to Home Sense that allows dogs. This is outside the mall and this was ok but still part of the Pen Centre. Then I returned to the mall to take care of what I intended to originally before this overzealous security guard confronted me and witnessed another dog in the mall in a a roller. That was ok? Same security guard walked by and didn‚Äôt say a word. Just a joke.

I even talked to a few of the store managers in my shopping experience and was told that these security guards are hurting business with their commando attitude.

Do yourself a favour and go to the outlets. Pen Centre has turned into a sub par mall and hiring sub par security is further hurting their already suspect business. The mall has many empty stores and sub par stores. Courtesy desk  represents the mall, not security that is contract hired. I used to frequent the Pen all the time. Not anymore do yourselves a favour and go to the Outlet Collection of Niagara. Oh and I forgot to add, when I said we called and said we had a toy poodle the security guard said oh that may be the problem you said ‚Äútoy‚Äù poodle. Maybe they thought you called about a toy. Ya! Ok! I called to see if I could bring a toy to the mall. Such stupidity. Pen Centre your
Best days are behind you
And asking people to watch your mall
Like the idiots you have are representative of what this mall  has become. The
Security guard supervision who did show up to deescalate the situation was professional and said all then right things."
Landmark Cinemas (St. Catharines),5,"The Pen Center is the perfect community center yet big enough to accommodate large stores line Walmart, zehrs, Hudson bay etc. Has sections for asian and European fast food restaurants. It's perfect for pleasure shopping and afternoons at Tim Hortons. The bus stop is right there for both local and regional transit."
Church's Texas Chicken (5846 Drummond Road),4,"You can get a sandwich, a side and a drink for $12 cad. Good option for fast food lovers. There are no vegetarian options here. Tasty and good service."
Church's Texas Chicken (5846 Drummond Road),2,Mediocre all around. The 3 piece special is greasy flavourless chicken with a bisket and McCain super fries. The ‚Äúfresh small batch‚Äù chicken was cold as it sat in a pile under a heat lamp. I wanted to wash the greasy chicken residue off my hands and fortunately one of the three washrooms was not out of order. I was full but hardly satisfied. I doubt I‚Äôll be back.
Church's Texas Chicken (5846 Drummond Road),5,"The best service I have ever had in a restaurant. Areeza at the counter was super helpful and caring. She showed really nice gestures to not only us but the senior citizens who were ahead of us as well.

Very rarely seen this kind of behaviour. Just love it!

‚ÄúHighly recommended‚Äù"
Church's Texas Chicken (5846 Drummond Road),1,"Staffs are nice.

Fried chickens are at standard level,but the 20 pieces wings are EXTREMELY SALTY!!!!!!!! ü§¢Been ordered church‚Äôs wings at other location, they are pretty good. But the wings here this time is too salty to swallow!!!!!!!!!
They should really keep the standard taste and check before delivering the food to customers. Sad to waste 20 wings‚Ä¶."
Church's Texas Chicken (5846 Drummond Road),2,"We order from this location often enough and usually dont have any issues but tonight we ordered two combos ( one 3pc and one 5pc) firstly, we didn't receive the sauce we ordered ( which isn't a big deal at all ) BUT then we split a tender in half and it was PINK.  Both combos were like this. Very disappointing."
Swiss Chalet (Geneva St),5,"Amazing service,  staff here is always friendly and even remembered our orders. Food is fresh and delicious.  The front counter girls were doing such a great working through this holiday season with smile on their faces. Today the Manger I believe her name was Jen we wanted to give her shout out. Remember which puzzles we called about and brought out the ones we wanted as soon as we got there :) Thank you"
Swiss Chalet (Geneva St),5,"Great experience dining in this establishment.
My compliments to Carlos for the best fries I've had at any Swiss Chalet. I can't tell you how often I'm served fries having most of the portion consisting of bottom fryer crumbs and even had to send my plate back to correct this in other places.
The service was very pleasant and first time I never had to ask for an extra napkin. Might seem simple thing but often times when I've had to ask for an extra napkin other locations Id sometimes get a tiny square one that acts as a thin drink coaster.. not even joking.
Thank you Swiss Chalet, I really appreciate your top efforts in serving your customers. Well done."
Swiss Chalet (Geneva St),2,"Very disappointed with the food..chicken was overcooked,dry and mealy..order was wrong,  the fries we did get were limp and uncooked. We get your busy but I would rather wait a few more minutes to get good fries and perfectly cooked chicken....never coming back...the rotisserie chicken from Costco is only $7.99 and so much juicier and delicious.

."
Swiss Chalet (Geneva St),3,Ordered take-out online and received a notification that it would be ready in 15 minutes. I had to wait an extra 20 minutes after I got there. Very unorganized. It seems that I would have gotten better service had I chose to eat-in. Won't be ordering there again.
Swiss Chalet (Geneva St),3,The food and prices were good. I didn't like where I was sitting. We chose a booth and it was filthy. It was all stained. Doesn't the staff or managers notice that? I  won't be going back to that restaurant.
Lee's home taste Braised  ChickenÔºàËÄÅÊùéÈªÑÁÑñÈ∏°Ôºâ,5,Had this weekly when I was in uni in St Catharines. Moved to Toronto two months ago and have been back to get the braised chicken and rice atleast 4 times. The quantity and flavour is great. One of the best braised chickens I have had.
Lee's home taste Braised  ChickenÔºàËÄÅÊùéÈªÑÁÑñÈ∏°Ôºâ,5,We loved the braised chicken and rice and the braised ribs!! Broth is very flavourful and with really fast service. Trust the owner when she says medium is really spicy üòÖ
Lee's home taste Braised  ChickenÔºàËÄÅÊùéÈªÑÁÑñÈ∏°Ôºâ,5,"Excellent food prepared well with decent portions. If you can handle spicy highly recommend their highest spice level. Otherwise, they have mild spicy level as well."
Lee's home taste Braised  ChickenÔºàËÄÅÊùéÈªÑÁÑñÈ∏°Ôºâ,2,"Order from door dash .
1 . Half portion than order directly
2. Different taste

Did I order faked one ?"
Lee's home taste Braised  ChickenÔºàËÄÅÊùéÈªÑÁÑñÈ∏°Ôºâ,5,The spicy steam pot is absolutely delicious and very reasonably priced. They‚Äôre popcorn chicken is very well seasoned. Absolutely love this place and can‚Äôt wait to try more dishes.
Little Caesars (Lincoln Street),1,"Went there Sunday had to wait 45 min.
But the poor guy before us was there for approximately  ahour and a half. This was our pizza. The holiday bundle"
Little Caesars (Lincoln Street),2,If you like crust more than anything else on the pizza then this is your place. Staff are pleasant to deal with but pizza could be made better.
Little Caesars (Lincoln Street),5,"Fantastic! I came in early and they prepared my order on the spot! Fantastic people who deserve a raise! (Keep up The hard work guys, even after your shift at Little Caesar‚Äôs!) -Ozzy"
Little Caesars (Lincoln Street),1,"The new Fanceroni Pepperoni is advertised as a pizza loaded with 2 types of pepperoni to the carmelized cheese crust. The one I got was a regular pepperoni pizza with the cup and crisp pepperoni added to it. When I asked the employee where was the carmelized edge, I was told the boss told us not to make it the way it is advertised. I wonder what head office would think about it. Same owner owns a ll the Little Ceasars locations in Welland, so not much sense in trying to get a proper one in Welland. The commercial made me a customer for the first time in years, the owner being too cheap to make it proper has made me decide not to be a customer for years again."
Little Caesars (Lincoln Street),5,"A great place to get pizza where the limited staff on duty do all they can to provide quick efficient service with a smile. Seriously, sometimes there is only 1-2 staff doing all of the duties demanded in a pizzeria and they get me my pizza as quick as possible everytime and the only time I find they are not as kind, is after they've served an incredibly rude customer. I would be irritable after that too.
They are a great place to eat and the staff are human too, treat them as such.

Sincerely,

An extremely satisfied customer."
City South Pizza (Niagara),1,"0/10

I won't even bother with a breakdown. The sauce seemed decent but there was overpowering spices. Tastes like curry and garam masala, not a deluxe Italian pizza. They also delivered the wrong order and refused to correct the error. Avoid at all costs and note that the reviews are inaccurate.

Crust was decent, thick and buttery. I didn't order thick crust however, so disappointing as well. Toppings were plentiful but tasted like curry spice. Lots of cheese and good quality."
City South Pizza (Niagara),5,"This pizza was so good!!! We got a medium with black olives, feta cheese, tomatoes, and Italian sausage. It was cooked to perfection! Would 100% eat here again. Service was really good too!! They were very thorough and polite."
City South Pizza (Niagara),5,"best indian style pizza and wings.Try their specialty pizzas with triple blend cheese !!
Lot of sides items and great customer service"
City South Pizza (Niagara),5,Had the best ever cup nd char pepperoni pizza here‚Ä¶. The bread was delicious so were the flavoursüëçüèªüëçüèª
City South Pizza (Niagara),5,9.7 rating on just one slice of their pepperoni pizza I like the crust of the pizza too little amount of sauce.. I like the small pepperoni‚Ä¶ great work .. when your low on cash this pizza shop helps me out ..
Jack Astor's (400 Ontario St.),3,Not to Jack Astor standards. The restaurant needs a good cleaning inside. The beer glasses always showed the Jack Astor logo but not. Staff ignores customers to take orders somewhat surprising but congregrate with locals. Barman was not even wearing a company shirt his own shirt. Local patrons hang out in corner drinking with no food orders just beer. Two tables are occupied in entire restaurant. One blocking fire exit near bar. Garlic bread loaf was soaked in garlic butter and wings were desperately under cooked. Management is not maintaining standards.
Jack Astor's (400 Ontario St.),4,Always wonderful staff especially the days I go in there I always go in the off days. Now I've given that hint away everyone's going to go on the off days and I'll have to change my plans. I can only eat a handful of things due to the sheer amount of allergies I have and that's one of the few restaurants I know of that I can walk in order something off the menu and it literally won't kill me. Wonderful place wonderful people recommended. I will make the suggestion to people going there with children bring a box of crowns with you so they have more than three colors to choose from
Jack Astor's (400 Ontario St.),5,"I love Jack Astors...go there all the time with Family and friends. I have dietary issues...and l was told that my favourite meal is being taken off the menu July 17th.  I was so disappointed at this üòû Please keep  Rice dishes which are gluten and dairy free !
Loyal customer"
Jack Astor's (400 Ontario St.),5,"I recently visited Jack Astor's Bar & Grill in St. Catharines and I must say that it was a fantastic experience. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by friendly staff and a great atmosphere.

The food was outstanding. I ordered the BBQ ribs and they were cooked to perfection. The portion size was generous and the sauce was delicious. My friends ordered other items from the menu and everyone was happy with their meals.

The drinks were also great. They have a wide selection of beers, wines, and cocktails to choose from. I tried their signature cocktail and it was absolutely delicious.

The service was exceptional. Our server was attentive, friendly, and always had a smile on her face. She made sure that we had everything we needed and provided excellent recommendations.

Overall, I had a wonderful experience at Jack Astor's Bar & Grill in St. Catharines. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great food, drinks, and service. Five stars all the way!"
Jack Astor's (400 Ontario St.),3,"Used to come to Jack Astors pre Covid all the time. Ashley would serve us and she was WONDERFUL each and everytime. Tonight we went for dinner and our server was so uninterested it made us question if we made the right decision to come there.

The host (a male) was so friendly and kind. I wish I could remember his name he was awesome !

We asked for ketchup for the fries and by the time the server brought it‚Ä¶ we were done our meal.

Food was okay, probably will give this another shot in the future."
Gino's Pizza (Glenridge Ave),2,"Short version: Decent pizza if you like a greasy crust, but the place smells gross, looks gross, they will substitute details of your order without telling you, and their online ordering platform is garbage.

More details: Used to come here quite a bit a few years ago but stopped when the black olives were off twice in a row. Now that Pizza Pizza doesn't offer whole grain crust anymore decided to try Gino's again since they have whole wheat. Tried to order using their website. You can't view their toppings or other options unless you create an account first, which is super annoying. The order  interface doesn't tell you which items cost extra so it's a crapshoot to see if the pizza is going to cost what you think (pesto sauce is $3.50 extra on a medium pizza, for example). After all that, you can't even pay online. Why force people to get an online account just to see the menu if you won't let them pay online?

Anyway, went to pick up the pizzas. Place smells really gross now - has a really strong mildew smell. As another reviewer noted, the guy's hands weren't clean who handled payment but they just appeared to be dirty with flour so gave the benefit of the doubt on that.

Got home with the pizza, and guess what? No whole wheat crust. Double-checked to make sure we ordered correctly and we did.
Besides all that the pizza was decent, but we are  done with this place forever."
Gino's Pizza (Glenridge Ave),1,"I ordered my pizza from this place over the phone.I asked if there were any walk in specials and this guy had no clue as to what I was talking about, so he passed the phone to his co-worker who said there were no specials. I ordered my large pizza with double cheese and was told it would be 15 minutes. When I walked in to this fine establishment they had no clue but I was assured my pizza was going to be ready in 5 minutes. When I went back to the restaurant after 10 minutes of waiting in the parking lot the first question this girl asked me was what size pizza was it that I ordered? I couldn‚Äôt believe the service! My pizza was not even in the oven‚Ä¶They were just going to start making it!! I shook my head, and left and ordered a delicious pizza from Fat Cats Pizza! The service was HORRIBLE! Don‚Äôt recommend this place at all!"
Gino's Pizza (Glenridge Ave),5,"Since this pizza place had high ratings and since I was definitely craving pizza I'm so so glad I did! Everything about their pizza was absolutely yummy...the cheese was gooey, the bacon was fresh and they weren't stingy with it...had other items on it as well...even the crust was great! Price was perfect as well. Now I have a new favorite pizza place and they are so close!"
Gino's Pizza (Glenridge Ave),2,"Just ordered 2 pizzas, the person making it didn‚Äôt wash their hands not even wearing gloves üò≥ü§Æ. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever order pizza from them again!"
Gino's Pizza (Glenridge Ave),1,Very poor service. I always order from door dash and customize the order but didn‚Äôt get any toppings as I mentioned in the order. I contacted the store and ask them to make the order properly but they refused. I was ready to pay them extra but still they didn‚Äôt make the order properly.
Culinary Dropout Fonthill,5,"This was my first time at the Culinary Dropout, at the recommendation of my mother, with whom we went with for her birthday dinner. It was a really great experience, highlighted by our wonderful server Emily.  It has an exciting and friendly vibe to it, and of course, the food is excellent.  Several of us had the pizza, and I had the brisket sandwich, which was really delicious!  Properly smoked and melted in my mouth.  I will most certainly go back.  One suggestion would be to add more local craft beer options on tap, although the one that was available was perfect.  Thank you!"
Culinary Dropout Fonthill,5,Delicious lunch at Culinary Dropout. Quality of food and service was incredible. They even have a great selection of cocktails and mocktails. They have a great setup for the outdoor patio - really made good use of the space. Highly recommend.
Culinary Dropout Fonthill,5,"The Bacon Smash Burger was the perfect size and so delicious. My wife got the Dirty Bird and loved it. Our waitress was awesome. Luckily, we got In when we did because it got pretty busy soon afterwards. We would definitely be back!"
Culinary Dropout Fonthill,5,We happened upon this restaurant while out for a drive.  It was great!  We were sat beside the bay doors that opened to give you that patio feel with indoor comfort. I felt the breeze from outside at my table.  The food was great and our waitress was awesome and very attentive!  And I love that I get rewards to enjoy it all!
Culinary Dropout Fonthill,4,"Great place to check out! Staff were very nice, the restaurant was clean, and it was a fun atmosphere. Food was very good! The beef short rib was amazing! The burger was ok, possibly overcooked. We ordered the bacon smash but they brought the classic burger, not a big deal. The truffle fries were yummy. I recommend getting The Dip, creamy and cheesy with lobster and shrimp but not heavy at all! Such a good app."
Bamboo Restaurant,1,"My food was 15 minutes late and cold, didn‚Äôt taste very good. Took an hour to arrive and when I called to complain and they offered me a chicken fried rice. It‚Äôs passable Chinese food, and I‚Äôve definitely had better from here but this time was unacceptable and they really should‚Äôve at least refunded my deliver fee. $70 order with $8 delivery charge, and the guy gets lost and food shows up cold and late. Not worth it. Try another restaurant."
Bamboo Restaurant,5,Have you ever noticed that the Worn down Chinese restaurants always have the BEST food? This place is no exception. It's because it's survived the test of time and you can taste the experience & love in their food. Don't judge a book by its cover! It's the best Chinese food in Welland! üòÉ
Bamboo Restaurant,5,"Don't let the outside deter you, it looks like the 60s but the food was surprising good and affordable, will definitely go back soon, revised, just tried chicken chop suey, best ever!"
Bamboo Restaurant,5,Me and my family has been eating here since I was a child and we've always loved it they've always been so consistent. Personally my favourite combination plate with combination plate c with chicken balls chicken fried rice on egg roll and the yummy red sauce.
Bamboo Restaurant,3,Has really gone down hill over the years. The food is not what it used to be. Hope they get it turned around. Used to be my favourite spot
Magnolia Chinese Cuisine,5,"Our favorite place in Niagara for lunch. Amazing food, super fast service. Helpful staff. We ordered Wonton not knowing they contain pork. The waitress asked us whether we ate pork. Great gesture. Plenty of parking.  Clean washroom. Nice interior."
Magnolia Chinese Cuisine,5,"We were looking for a Chinese place since our usual was closed. We placed an online order 1 hour before close. Went straight there to pick it up and it was ready. The people were friendly during pick up. The food was SO good! Half my family is vegetarian and we absolutely loved the options we chose. The veggies and tofu was my favourite. I loved how saucy the veggies were, it tasted so good !! I think we may have just found our new go to place for Chinese food : )"
Magnolia Chinese Cuisine,5,Finally found a great place for Chinese Food in Niagara Falls. Food is great! Very clean and a nice and relaxed atmosphere. The Orange Chicken was 10/10. Back next trip to the Falls.
Magnolia Chinese Cuisine,5,In Niagara Falls with colleagues for a conference and we had the most delicious dinner here. The restaurant was so lovely to sit in and the tables made it feel more like a family dinner. The pepper beef was wonderful and the shrimp stir fry was thoroughly enjoyed. Large portions and more than enough for sharing. The staff were polite and attentive - fabulous customer service. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting a great dinner at very reasonable prices.
Magnolia Chinese Cuisine,5,The food is great. The service is nice . The indoor decoration is elegant and peaceful.
Asia Fusion,4,"Ordered the pineapple fried rice w chicken, chicken/shrimp pad Thai and szechuan beef tonight from SKIP.  All the dishes were tasty as f ..and there was so much fried rice the container hardly closed...never seen so much.   Anyway,  we will continue to order from here...this was the best beef dish I've ever eaten from any Chinese restaurant"
Asia Fusion,5,"Absolutely delicious!  Friendly staff, happy to greet you & assist you with any questions you may have on their Menu.
Pad Thai was perfection, loved the noodle choice used at Asia Fusion - quality is superior over what you get at othere places.  Definitely a ""go to""!"
Asia Fusion,5,"ASIA FUSION Restaurant is a Great place to have CHINESE, INDIAN & Nepalese cuisine.
Wide choices of menu available with well experienced chef üë©‚Äçüç≥ üßë‚Äçüç≥ üë®‚Äçüç≥ . Beautiful ambience with smiley staffs.
We tried sweet corn soup, chilli chicken dry, Salmon Sushi, Steamed chicken Mo:Mo, Szechuan Fish, Chef special Briyani. All the items came with great quantity & loads of aromatic flavours.
Chef RC & Dharmendra served us their best meal. Highly recommend ASIAN FUSION e-bike you are travelling to Niagara, Welland, Thorold area.
Best wishes ASIA FUSION !!! I will visit again soon üîú"
Asia Fusion,3,A little pricey for a hole in the wall restaurant. They have GOOD noodles however the spring rolls we ordered tasted a bit like chemicals that went bad‚Ä¶ not sure what happened there.
Asia Fusion,5,"Delicious food, amazing taste. If you are around Welland, a must visit place for Indo chinese hakka cuisine."
Rangla Punjab Indian Restaurant,5,"If you're looking for authentic Indian food than look no further!!
The butter chicken, goat curry and samosa's are out of this world. (I have only tried these so far) If you are in Niagara  falls this is the place you want to eat. Super friendly staff and a soon to be open patio to ensure they can serve more people during the busier times. This is a business you surely should support as they  are trying to make the community a better place. They feed the homeless and will help anyone in need. I would highly recommend you eat here. All meats they use are fresh from the butcher nothing comes in frozen. Make sure you eat here you will not be disappointed. They also make there naan fresh to order!!!!"
Rangla Punjab Indian Restaurant,5,"The most authentic tasting food here among all the restaurants I‚Äôve been to in Canada. We visit here from Toronto at least once per month. You‚Äôll never be disappointed. Best tasting samosa chat, butter chicken, garlic naan, amritsari kulcha. The owner is very welcoming and a kind hearted person. Love this place."
Rangla Punjab Indian Restaurant,4,"We went there first time after checking reviews on google, ordered kadai panner daal tadka and naan and raita . The strange thing was I said don't make spicy kadai paneer, but when I tried it was too spicy. Also, raita was not actually raita it's like simple curd and they put bhoondi on it. Taste like it's spoiled . So overall ok ok restro.."
Rangla Punjab Indian Restaurant,4,"Very nice place to eat in niagara Falls. The parking space is extremely small, may be just for like 5 6 cars. But you can go across the street and park in the residential area. Food is tasty. The restaurant is very small and hence groups are given preference but couples and singles have to wait. Hopefully, the owner buys a Big Second Restaurant.
Recommend!!"
Rangla Punjab Indian Restaurant,5,"Always come to this place when in Niagara. It has great great indian food and hakka Chinese food too. Honey Chili potatoes and veg noodles were the best. We also got chili garlic momos,  chili chicken, veg manchurian as hakka apps. Then, finished it off with dal makhni, paneer butter masala, and garlic naan. Overall, the food is great here! There can be wait times during peak hours, but it's worth the wait."
Pete's Pizza,5,My family and I frequently visit this location of Pete‚Äôs Pizza and the quality of the food never fails to amaze me. This time we also ordered the Butter Chicken Pizza and it was the best we‚Äôve ever had. Highly recommend anything on their menu!
Pete's Pizza,5,This is my 4th time ordering since renovations and restructuring. I couldn't be happier. The Philly cheese steak poutine has given me new hope. Consistent quality everytime. I always pick up so I imagine their delivery is good too. I really like the new light out front it breathes fresh air into downtown and is pretty at night. Thank  you.
Pete's Pizza,5,"Excellent!

1) We requested our pie to be uncut due to my severe allergies and they were super kind about it.

2) Delivery was quick.

3) Food was better than expected (we are unfamiliar with this company). We are thrilled that the chicken is real.

The only improvement I would suggest is to offer thin crust but theirs was really not bad.

We may have found our Niagara Falls pizza place.

Thanks Guys ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°"
Pete's Pizza,5,"I stayed over at the Great Wolf Lodge this week and Pete‚Äôs Pizza was the main reason my trip was that much enjoyable! My friends and I appreciated the kindness of the staff, quality/presentation of the food, and quantity. The prices were super reasonable for what‚Äôs served and we had their food for most meals as there‚Äôs so much variety. I‚Äôd highly recommend Pete‚Äôs Pizza Victoria to anyone that visits nearby!"
Pete's Pizza,5,"Ive never felt more welcomed at any resteraunt in Niagara Falls. The food is extremely well priced, they provide a very fair quantity and great quality for a fair price compared to other local pizza places. Since I moved to the falls 2 years ago Ive struggled to find any take out or eat ins that actually value their customers so the service with a smile is refreshing. Recommended for those who enjoy friendly service."
Green Island Chinese Resturant and Bar,1,"1 Stars for the Nice Plastic Take Out Bag and the Packets of Soy Sauce. I had never ordered from this location before, our regular place was closed, so we took a shot. I had only seen the Reviews on THEIR page and not Google, until after we ordered. I have never ever had a version of Chinese Food that is this bad! Seriously! Lemon Chicken was so gross, its not a fine batter, it was from frozen like the rest of the food. The ""Lemon Sauce"" was chunky and thick in a small container and not lemon at all. See the Frozen Pea Pic, has frostbite!  That chicken dish, ZERO Flavor! Everything truly was BLAND & cooked from FROZEN! Lesson Learned. We ordered a Dinner for 2 plus the Lemon Chicken and 2 Extra Spring Rolls. Which were garbage. They supplied two little containers with something for a sauce, we assumed it was for the chicken balls, but it was not sweet and sour sauce. Spent $40 and threw out 3/4's of the stuff (refuse to call it food). Oh and the smell, almost forgot to mention that... it has to be sesame seed oil. They bathe everything in it... it is NOT a seasoning or flavor! It's gross when its all you can taste or smell on the rice."
Green Island Chinese Resturant and Bar,1,"This place has decent reviews on Uber so I ordered it. Quick delivery and hot food. Upon opening and looking at the food, it looked bland. Sure enough it was super bland. There was no seasoning in the food but the ingredients seemed fresh. I want to tell the owner stop being cheap and put some seasoning. Also, the general tao was soupy. I would not recommend if you are craving Chinese food... Unless you like bland taste."
Green Island Chinese Resturant and Bar,5,"The portions at Green Island are always big and the service staff is very friendly. We like to order the combos at the back of the menu, great value for the money."
Green Island Chinese Resturant and Bar,5,"The food is full and fresh, and the service is good. I ordered takeaway and enjoyed a 10% discount. The price is affordable and it is an acceptable dining place"
Green Island Chinese Resturant and Bar,4,"We ordered from Green Island and were pleased with the speed of service, especially considering that it was delivering from Niagara Falls to St. Catharines. The food was still hot when it arrived.

The deal was great. The amount of food you get for the price was just remarkable. For sure a great choice when ordering!

I adored the chicken balls and noodles. I would love to try this place out in person as I see they have a patio! Can't wait to update the review once I do."
Hot Kitchen,2,"I wish I could give good rating but the recent visit to the restaurant spoiled it. Once, we had lunch here and really liked their biryani. So wanted to try again when I visited Niagara. But it was totally disappointing as the biryani was bland. I told them and the staff was kind enough to try once more. However, the one which was served earlier was way better than the compensated one. IDK where it went wrong. Kindly check and review the taste of chicken biryani. I'd like to visit again hoping you'd be able to fix it. Thanks."
Hot Kitchen,5,"FULLY HALAL!!! Im from London & was visiting Niagara Falls so came towards St Catharine for food afterwards. This place did not disappoint AT ALL. Such amazing authentic south Asian food and it tasted like being at home. Thank you for the amazing food and even more amazing prices. The Lamb Biryani was AMAZING & so was the Dinner Combo Special. You guys need so many more amazing reviews üëçüèºüëçüèº‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Sorry the food was too good to take pictures before hand ü§£ü§£"
Hot Kitchen,5,"I love the food. My personal favourite Vegetable pakora and chicken biryani. Recently tried, Chilli chicken, which was very spicy. Chicken 65 tasted good. Portions and prices are unbeatable."
Hot Kitchen,4,We made a quick stop to have lunch when returning from Niagara. Tired their meal with fish fry and really liked it. The biryani was good for the price point. Overall it was good.
Hot Kitchen,5,Awesome restaurant with very fr8endly staff if your new to Indian cuisine it's amazing the butter chicken is ten outta ten for me I have been all over Niagara but never found butter chicken as good
Firehouse Subs (Niagara Falls),3,"Way over priced, Subway is half the cost, and u get to add more items.
You get the standard lettuce and tomato, onions and cheees, everything else is considered a Add on..
1 )The steak on the steak and and cheese sub was very tender and tasty.  2)  The Turkey sub usually comes with bacon, do to dietary restriction l could not eat the bacon. Instead they gave me extra meat on my sub, but forgot the deli mustard.  With a water an a vitamin water, the bill came to $  39.00 bucks ."
Firehouse Subs (Niagara Falls),5,"The subs are amazing! I love the bread. Staff was friendly. Tables were clean. Order was correct. Happy that there was parking available. The subs at Firehouse are generally more expensive than Subway or Mr. Sub, but the quality is much better."
Firehouse Subs (Niagara Falls),4,"Tried it for the first time. Ordered 3 subs , all delicious. I had the steak which i was hesitant with the mustard sauce ...but actually was delicious. Good portion of meat and the bun is the best I've had on a sub. Clean atmosphere. Only gave 4 stars because the pop machine was out of most flavors. It was 23 dollars and change for the large steak sub combo with chip and pop. Definitely will be the go to for steak sub cravings."
Firehouse Subs (Niagara Falls),5,Awesome subs !!! U looking for a real sub ? Look no farther as this place is the real deal. It's a little pricey but u get what u pay for and u will not be disappointed. My wife and I have ate here a few times now and the food is incredible for a sub shop..when u go your better off to est in as they steam there meat and if it sits to long serten subs will go soggy. Great place to chow down....ENJOY!!! We did...Shawn.W from Hamilton.On.
Firehouse Subs (Niagara Falls),5,This place was awesome. They even have gluten free buns. The guy that served us was really nice and attentive. Pretty sure he was the owner. If not this man needs a promotion üòâ
Fresh Burrito (5932 Victoria Ave),5,"As a vegetarian and spicy food enthusiast, the burrito with the spiciest dip recommended by the staff here (Paras) blew my mind! I tend to prefer Indian food thanks to its variety in veg options but for the first time in this city, another cuisine impressed me just as much. Thank you, Paras, for the recommendation! Mexican food did not disappoint üåØ"
Fresh Burrito (5932 Victoria Ave),4,"Great food, big quantities and nice service. Have it 4 stars since it‚Äôs a fast food take on Mexican food."
Fresh Burrito (5932 Victoria Ave),5,Fresh delicious food and fast friendly service. We had the chicken hard tacos and they were delicious. Prices are fair and they have a good selection of items to choose from.
Fresh Burrito (5932 Victoria Ave),4,"Food was fresh and they make your food in front of you. There were only two people working, rotating between making food and checking you out. I don‚Äôt know how they do it but they were very efficient. I ordered steak and fish tacos. Steak tacos were delicious. However, the fish filet in the fish tacos were a little big it‚Äôs hard to eat in the taco imo."
Fresh Burrito (5932 Victoria Ave),5,"Probably one of the best tacos and churros I've had in a while. They were very generous with the amount of toppings thrown into my supreme fries + shout out to them being open until 4 AM and still giving great customer service. Me and my friend went at 2:30 AM as it was hard to find a place open (and we were craving some food) so kudos to them. The restaurant itself feels very locally owned and it has a small lobby (that was full at the time). Even with a lobby full of customers, the workers worked hard, showed equal respect and patience with each order, and did it really well at that. I will highly recommend this place to anyone I know if they visit or stay at Niagara."
Smoke's Poutinerie (St Paul & James),2,Wasn't the worst...  but definitely not worth the price.   A $20 poutine...  gimme a break.   Definitely Wasn't worth the price!  Won't be buying again.   What a shame!
Smoke's Poutinerie (St Paul & James),5,My daughters and I stopped her today before heading over the the hockey game. I didn't catch the lady's name working alone (she had blue in her hair) I just wanted to give her a shout out that she was absolutely phenomenal! Between walk-ins and deliveries she was absolutely killing it. The poutines we amazing as usual! Keep up the great work guys ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Smoke's Poutinerie (St Paul & James),1,"Very stingy, payed almost $5 for extra sauce and they barely put anything. Had a totally of 4 cheese curds. For what it costs, definitely not worth it."
Smoke's Poutinerie (St Paul & James),5,"At first, it was difficult to find the restaurant because it's like in the back alley. Other than that, the food and service were really good. First time trying poutine and it was good. Though it's best for a late night snack, I don't think it would be a substitute for a good dinner meal."
Smoke's Poutinerie (St Paul & James),5,"Decent food decent staff and decent place I love the bag and so does our cats.

I would not recommend the taters as the base, but my fiance would recommend the opposite so it depends on whether you like the mushy tater tot style or if you prefer a nice multi-dimensional bite of a French fry poutine, akin to the traditional Canadian dish.

I will be back."
Volcanos Pizzeria (Fonthill),5,"Went here on a whim, we were camping in the area. The gentlemen working are super efficient and friendly. The pizza and wings were hot and delicious and the crust was to die for. 10/10
Highly recommend."
Volcanos Pizzeria (Fonthill),5,"I really liked Volcano‚Äôs pizza. Ordered pickup and it was ready on time. Service was also very nice. Wings were great, nice and saucy! Pizza was also really good :) lots of leftovers, yum!"
Volcanos Pizzeria (Fonthill),5,"Volcano's in St. Catharines was my favourite pizza joint before I moved to Welland. I've tried the one in Welland but really was not a fan so I tried the Fonthill location hoping it would compare to my old favourite and I'm glad I did.

I ordered through Skip the Dishes and got a pizza that was made incorrectly. (No cheese on 1/4 instead of just cheese on 4 slices) Surprisingly, Skip was no help and just told me they would pass on the information which was obviously BS.

I contacted the store directly to ask what happened. The manager apologized for the mix up and explained his employee wrote down the order incorrectly so he made my family a new pizza and delivered it free of charge within 20 minutes!

It was delicious, hot, cheesy and the dough on the second was much better as well!

10/10 for customer service!"
Volcanos Pizzeria (Fonthill),5,"Had a little trouble with an order and i called back and got a very professional response. Order was refunded and I was given a free item as well. That's the way to do business. I'm sending people your way. Very Impressive.

Shayla,"
Volcanos Pizzeria (Fonthill),1,"Hope you have time to kill cause this place never has things ready on time. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs walk-in, delivery or delivery service. They are VERY SLOW to greet you when you walk in, you stand there waiting to be greeted but numerous staff just walk by and don‚Äôt ask if you‚Äôve been helped"
Subito Sandwich,5,"Great little sub shop, went out of our way on a trip to Montreal to stop here. Well worth the extra two hours driving. Attached are photos of the house made Nanaimo bars, cannoli and a roast beef sandwich (house made roast beef). The other photo is the spicy Italian. We let the staff pick the cheeses toppings and sauces for us. Great service and even better food!!! Huge portion!!!"
Subito Sandwich,1,Ordered a vegetarians sandwich in doordash because I heard it was good. Didn‚Äôt even get any cheese in my sandwich even though it said I would get extra since I paying the same price as a meat sandwich. Terrible. First time trying them and my very last. Super disappointed. I don‚Äôt k ow how it is in person but absolutely don‚Äôt order online from them. They don‚Äôt care.
Subito Sandwich,5,We consistently enjoy sandwiches from Subito and decided to order cannoli and meat platters for our wedding from them. Could not be more pleased with the quality of the food we received‚Äî the meat platters were beautifully arranged and everyone raved about the taste of everything! Service is always great. Cannot recommend them more!
Subito Sandwich,5,"Ordered delivery off of UberEats from this place because my friend said it was her favorite sandwich place. Couldn't pass up on it especially after looking through the menu.

-[EGGPLANT PARMIGIANA] $9.96
ü•ñ For the price, you can pretty much load your sub up with as many toppings/sauces offered on their menu (double meat/cheese has extra charges)
ü•ñ I got the following on mine: cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickled eggplant, extra pickles, black olives, green olives, sun dried tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, ranch, balsamic vinegar, spicy mayo
ü•ñ I have never enjoyed eggplant so much in a food before this, highly recommend this as a vegetarian option!

-[CREAM OF BROCCOLI SOUP] $4.87
ü•¶ I really enjoyed this soup!
ü•¶ Really delicious once stirred, and tastes homemade in the best way

I'm genuinely so sad that we don't have any Subito Sandwich locations near me but I suppose this sandwich spot will make me return back to Ottawa sooner than later

üìù Portion size of the sub easily could have been two meals"
Subito Sandwich,5,"Amazing sandwiches, fresh and so flavorful. They treat you like family. The customer service they provide is so incredible and rare. I use to work in the area and have since have got a different job so don't get to go as often. I miss everyone and the sandwiches. Best customer service and sandwiches in Ottawa and all of Canada."
Burger King #12882 (199 Montreal Road),5,"This is the best Burger King around! These employees like their jobs, and you can tell! Fresh fries, fresh burgers, fast & friendly service. Always ample parking and the location is close to many other services: gas, lcbo, banks & other shops. Clean and organized. Looking for your whopper fix? Come to this BK and you won't be dissappinted."
Burger King #12882 (199 Montreal Road),5,"I've lived and worked all over Canada. Burger King was my favourite burger joint ever since I could remember. So, I always eat at Burger King whenever I feel like having a treat. There's no better burger than a Whopper with cheese, when it's done right, stacked high and served hot, yummy....

The last two or three times I ate at BK, I think it was in New Brunswick and in Quebec. I was surprised about the quality of their burgers, they were not garnished very generously and they were served cold, like they had been made hours before. The last place I had a Whopper before I tried this location, they had barely put a sliver of tomato, a small piece of lettuce, and just one ring of a slice of onion. This was no Whopper, and it didn't taste like one.

My experience at this location on Montreal Road in Ottawa was like going back in time and tasting a Whopper like it tasted years ago. It was a perfectly built burger with generous toppings. Complete with loads of ketchup and mayonnaise dripping with tangy flavourful juices. That flame broiled burger flavour, served hot and juicy. Just like they use to do it at all the locations 20 years ago. I'll be back for more delicious memories. Thank you for conserving the traditional Whopper with Cheese flavour, this is the real thing!"
Burger King #12882 (199 Montreal Road),3,"On the Fast Food 5-Star scale this comes in at a below-average 2.8

Food is as expected, so that was fine. Due to its location though, I have seen lots of mental health crisis take place and the atmosphere can be tense at time. Now, while service is often a bit lackluster or slow, I do want to say that this rating is not a reflection on the staff itself, as I can only imagine the difficulty they deal with due to the aforementioned issues with guests."
Burger King #12882 (199 Montreal Road),4,When the older gentleman is there service is good. Otherwise it‚Äôs just ok. Food is pretty well prepared and never been missing anything in the orders. One annoying thing though is that i can‚Äôt seem to place an order on the app thus never getting rewards.
Burger King #12882 (199 Montreal Road),2,"The food is fine and the staff is nice. I'm only docking them one star for the open crack market in the parking lot, but the washroom is truly disgusting. Broken stall doors, no TP, and the Hazmat team hasn't been in since the last crime scene was wrapped up."
Pizza Pizza (673 West Somerset Street),4,"The Pizza Pizza on Somerset and Bronson is very near Ottawa‚Äôs Chinatown welcome arc. The franchise store is clean and staff provided good service. As for the food, it meets my expectations as a PIzza Pizza franchise.

Pizza Pizza (673 West Somerset Street),4,It's your average take out pizza place but the employees are really friendly and personable. I like their take out driver I don't know his name he's an older gentleman and it's always great seeing that old silver Honda pull up. For a quick bite to eat I'd come here rather than subway or McDonald's that's for sure
Pizza Pizza (673 West Somerset Street),1,How is every meat topping that doesn‚Äôt cost extra pork or ground beef. What if I‚Äôm watching my red meat intake? What if pork is not an option for me for religious reasons? This is beyond greedy as making pizza costs very little. Pizza pizza improved the flavour of their pizza but at what cost? My health? My religious beliefs? Do better guys
Pizza Pizza (673 West Somerset Street),1,I‚Äôd give no stars if I could I ordered a pizza tonight for my Mother‚Äôs Day dinner just to start my Mother‚Äôs Day off good Mother‚Äôs Day is a very hard time of year for me it‚Äôs very crippling and just passing and my day just got worse I ordered a pizza and it‚Äôs uncooked. I spent $31 and get some tips just to get uncooked Pizza no option of refund except for a 15% which is ridiculous considering I spent $31 that I probably should spend to get myself something to eat with my husband just for me not to get be able to eat it and for them to be very rude with me on the phone not happy I have been a long time customer for pizza pizza pretty much my whole life every time I want a pizza and grab it here and now I want nothing to do with them you guys just lost a really long term customer and I will never recommend you to my family
Pizza Pizza (673 West Somerset Street),1,"Ordered a gluten free pizza, said gluten free about four times, was given a regular pizza. After mentioning it, the customer service order guy ignored me and continued to serve other people while I sat there waiting for a refund with no offer to make me a new pizza. 45 minutes after ordering, I finally got s refund, but it was the worst service I've ever received at a pizza pizza. It's midnight and I'm tired after waiting forever. Pathetic."
McDonald's (Elgin St),1,"ordered a big mac meal and payed extra for large fries for me to open the bag when i got home and find a half empty fry container that equals the amount of basically a small fry, not even,  I hadn‚Äôt taken a single fry out of the box from the pictures and is this supposed to be a large fry? disgusted and not happy at all"
McDonald's (Elgin St),1,"This location is super slow for weekend breakfast. If you are in a hurry, don't think about it. Because they're slow, the inside is packed with people waiting for their orders. You cannot sit there and enjoy your food dine in. It's too bad McDonald's app won't allow cancelling online order, otherwise I would. I don't want to wait 15 minutes for a fast-food breakfast."
McDonald's (Elgin St),2,"Great location, but it's always understaffed, long waits for simple stuff, like a breakfast sandwich.  Always out of stock on certain items... no creamers or jelly to go, once I went in and they were only serving chicken items... Where was the beef?...üòÇ Oh well..."
McDonald's (Elgin St),2,Pretty average. Small and probably not the cleanest. Service was decent and they provide refillable soft drinks. The signature chicken burger was ok. Stop by if you want a quick and easy bite that is not too pricey.
McDonald's (Elgin St),1,"Very bad customer service, they always give me the wrong order no matter how many times I confirm with them!! And the place is always full of homeless people! Stay away from this branch for your own sanity!"
SAFI FINE FOODS INC,4,"This place is very charming and decorated beautifully. It is accessible for people with mobility aids and has lots of delicious food options. The mango nectar, croissants and iced latte made for a lovely brunch."
SAFI FINE FOODS INC,4,"Nice location and vibe, lots of drink/food options and grocery items. Good service. Grilled tofu sandwich (ended up being a wrap) was quite tasty and wholesome, as was the matcha latte. Great addition to the neighborhood! Will be back sometime!"
SAFI FINE FOODS INC,5,"Amazing owners, really fantastic food, great selection of unique and practical grocery items, beautiful decor and a cute and cozy atmosphere.  A real gem in the neighbourhood that we are incredibly thankful for.  Try their tandoori chicken bowl!  Insanely good!"
SAFI FINE FOODS INC,3,"Safi Fine food was pretty ordinary . I struck me as a corner store with a fancy name. The products on offer were mostly resold products you can find at a grocery store but at higher prices of course. There were some prepared foods available like tabouleh and salads, as well as a limited amount of hot finger foods."
SAFI FINE FOODS INC,1,This place has terrible service. After greeting me 2 workers kept there backs to me. Wouldn't help. Couldn't keep up. There was 3 people in the place.  After 5 minute wait was told it would take another 15 for food. Clueless.  Should be 0 stars.
A&W (155 Queen Street),5,"I really enjoy the A&W veggie burger combo, as I like the way they prepare their beyond meat patty. As for this specific location, I appreciated the fact that they gave me a chilled mug for my drink. Not only did this reduce waste, it also made my drink very cold.

Overall, I really enjoyed coming here for lunch. As I work in the area, I can definitely see myself coming back."
A&W (155 Queen Street),5,"This was my first time eating here. The food is delicious, the service impeccable, and the overall ambiance is amazing. One thing, though, the table I used to rat was a little dirty. However, a couple of minutes into my lunch, I noticed a young lady cleaning all the empty tables. So, it was probably just that I came in between cleaning. Therefore, a recommendation would be to have cleaning wipes on each table to allow customers to clean their own table as needed in between your regular table cleaning schedule. Other than that, everything else was wonderful. I recommend this place!"
A&W (155 Queen Street),5,"Amazing service! Went in at 1am Saturday night and had amazing service, and the restaurant was spotless. Want to say another HUGE thank you to the staff as my friend forgot his phone in the restaurant and they held on it for him until we were able to go back for it 10/10"
A&W (155 Queen Street),5,Classic A&W food with excellent service. The staff working here are very friendly. This is not currently a 24/7 location even though it states that. I recommend the Mozza burger if you aren‚Äôt sure what to get. Their milkshakes are also very good.
A&W (155 Queen Street),3,"Love it in the day, the night time order taking via apps is a pain. The trend of online app ordering rather than face to face is far less convenient when you're already there. Happening at Wendy's and A&Ws. The workers are good."
Harvey's (Bronson & Arlington),5,"Great service like you are at home, a.k.a the best crispy chicken burger in town!"
Harvey's (Bronson & Arlington),2,"Great fast food, but still fast food.

They‚Äôve extended their hours to 12am, however have decided to close the dining area still at 10pm. Seems like they‚Äôre only concerned and are interested in Uber eats orders. This takes away the value of walking in and having the privilege of eating there, after spending 20 dollars on a meal. I will not be going back to Harvey‚Äôs as this shows they do not value walk in clients."
Harvey's (Bronson & Arlington),4,"After a long drive to 613, this place is really convenient for us and all of us wanted have burgers.

Dine-in was still available and as there was nobody in the restaurant we decided to eat in. We had veggie burgers, fries, onion rings and a poutine. Some made vegan and all the burgers just the way we wanted it - customized to our preferences.

We love the burgers here and love a good deal. Both available on the day of our visit. The fries perfectly fried. The toppings plenty. Wish they had a vegan version of the ghost pepper sauce."
Harvey's (Bronson & Arlington),5,"This may well be the best Harvey's that we've visited. Clean, excellent customer service and we were greeted with a smile. They also were willing to accommodate my daughter's soy allergy by switching out the Angus burger bun with a soy-free wrap."
Harvey's (Bronson & Arlington),5,"Had a nice dinner.
One of the best place to get customized food with a variety of options.

Aladdin Bakery (St Laurent & Donald),5,"Awesome place, friendly staff, prices are reasonable and the food quality is high.  This is my special cheese pie with tomatoes. Recommend 5*"
Aladdin Bakery (St Laurent & Donald),5,if I can put more than 5 stars üåü I would do it because the test is amazing since long time we didn't get the original Arabic lahmajon
Aladdin Bakery (St Laurent & Donald),4,"This place has great meat & cheese pies which is what I go there for.  It can get pretty busy here but the service is fairly quick  and worth the wait.  The only downside of this place is they only deal with cash.  They do have an ATM in side for a fee of $2.50.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because you can't pay with debit.
I recommend their meat pies üòÅ"
Aladdin Bakery (St Laurent & Donald),5,"An absolute gem of a meat pie shop! Grew up getting lunch here and still swing by on every chance I get. The moment you step inside, you're enveloped in the mouthwatering aroma of freshly baked pies.  The range of fillings is impressive, offering something for everyone. The friendly staff adds a personal touch, making you feel like a valued customer. Whether you're a local or a visitor, this authentic meat pie shop is a must-visit destination.
Few things to remember, Cash only - ATM inside may not always be working - Parking is not ideal"
Aladdin Bakery (St Laurent & Donald),5,"Wonderful place to grab a pie. They have an excellent selection of quick grab and nutritious foods for the on-the-go person.
I always stop by here when I am in the area.  It's been consistent for over twenty years, that I've been coming here. How wonderful to have a local bakery that serves with a smile and always has good food to eat. Thank you Aladdin. üí™üëçüòä"
New King Shawarma Plus,5,"Excellent customer service and speedy order fulfillment.
The staff members displayed friendliness and remarkable professionalism in catering to customers and delivering efficient service.

The food was tasty , prepared with top-notch ingredients. Overall, my experience was exceptional, and I look forward to returning to the establishment during my next visit to Downtown."
New King Shawarma Plus,5,"I never knew sandwiches could be so delicious! Love this place!!! Fresh, tasty and friendly, I come here every day!"
New King Shawarma Plus,1,"usually great shawarma sandwich today at 2:11 the man that made this sandwich rushed and this sandwich was made poorly that i had to get a plate and eat it from there, thanks guys!"
New King Shawarma Plus,5,"The food here is consistently well made and full of flavor with a quaint, family-oriented atmosphere. The produce and proteins are created with fresh quality ingredients, where attentive and friendly staff tailor your order to your liking."
New King Shawarma Plus,5,"Food was delicious and everyone behind the counter was nice. The chicken was particularly good, not dry like it happens too often in this type of restaurant. We'll go back for sure."
Zesty Market (280 Elgin St),1,"The owner and his brother who work there are nice people, but the brown Indian man with glasses who works there is a WHOLE loser. Tiny little manlet filled with rage."
Zesty Market (280 Elgin St),1,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I was recently discriminated against and kicked out of the store because I was accused of ‚Äúacting suspicious ‚Äú because I was ‚Äútaking too long to buy something‚Äù. I am a black male over 6feet tall and was followed by what appeared to be the manager from the moment I stepped in the store. When I attempted to buy my items he took them off the counter and threw them against the wall and screamed at me to get out.

Absolutely disgusting behaviour! I will be reporting them to the HRTO for discrimination. Apparently others I‚Äôve spoke to have had similar experiences.

DO NOT SHOP HERE! There is a Quickie and Circle K right down the street which are way better options."
Zesty Market (280 Elgin St),1,I was buying something from here when I first moved to neighbourhood and I noticed how expensive a place can be so I didnt stop by there anymore. Today it was on my way and I said to myself %20 percent more wont hurt right now but at cashier I remembered that price was tripled. The $5.99 product was $18.59... If you dont want to feel like stupid dont enter...
Zesty Market (280 Elgin St),2,"Large variety of items, They have everything but fresh meat. But watch the fruits and vegetables (Not so fresh) By ready to pay double what grocery stores charge, Paid $4.38 for a can of tomato juice."
Zesty Market (280 Elgin St),4,"Went in October 29th 2020 at midnight looking for last minute birthday party food
(hold your horses people, I had 6 people over for my little sister's 8th birthday and we all wore masks, well under the limit of how many you can have inside.) I found some neat nick nacks to throw in some party favor bags and found all the drinks and snacks we were looking for. Staff was nice and offered to grab the three 2 liters I was looking to buy. I ordered junk food and snacks twice during my covid experience. We did recive something passed its expirey date, but it was gum. Who cares. Went in again recently to grab doritos. Noticing a lot of comments on rude staff and from my experiences...they have always been kind. Including the two times I called them to ask if everything was, infact, in stock when I ordered via uber. Staff member was happy to go see if they had ice cream sandwiches in stock before placing my order. Really made a difference considering covid-19 kicked me in the but and ice cream was the only thing I could manage to eat without throwing up for a few days. Thanks guys!"
Breakfast by Gabriel's,4,"i like their pizzaÔºÅand today tried their breakfast. the fruits on side for waffle are fresh but waffle itself tastes plain even with syrup and it tastes soft and flurry. and their potatoes also taste a little bit plain(just salt taste) but their sandwich is nice
PS: totally its like 4.5/5"
Breakfast by Gabriel's,5,"We had an amazing time getting together at Gabriel's Pizza at 100 Metcalfe in Ottawa!! We met the beautiful employee Rolla who took great care of our little group (thank you very much!!) She's excellent at what she does!! The food was wonderful!! Everyone ordered breakfast and all of our meals were cooked to perfection (thank you Chef!) We can't wait to be back in Ottawa again, we'll be back!!

**Highly recommend this Gabriel's Pizza location when in downtown Ottawa! **"
Breakfast by Gabriel's,5,"I went to this location in the morning looking for a sit down breakfast. I was seated and served promptly. It turned out that this location had closed their sit down section of the restaurant and we're opening up the next day. Instead of sending me elsewhere, they seated me and served me anyway... Without having the normal wait staff etc. On a snowy morning, I got my hot breakfast inside even though they weren't officially ready. Thanks for the excellent customer service. Breakfast was great for the price!"
Breakfast by Gabriel's,4,"Gabriel's is a reliable pizza place. Full menus and a variety of other dishesmake it great for lunch with colleagues. Specials are available, but not always announced. Better prices than some more expensive options."
Breakfast by Gabriel's,5,Great Pizza. Very friendly staff. Spacious. Busy with customers which makes it more appealing. Good choice of beer.
Pho Bo Ga King (Somerset),2,"It‚Äôs generally open late night so it‚Äôs a good to place in nighttime; so it‚Äôs very busy all the time.

As they cater a lot of customers it‚Äôs hard to maintain quality to be honest. I think I had below average Tom yum soap after long time; the shrimp wonton was alright; and price wise it‚Äôs expensive.

Best part was customer service, they are very friendly and humble."
Pho Bo Ga King (Somerset),1,"The most weird Pho I have ever had, it literally not a Pho at all, the soup tastes like chicken soup but a pho soup. Spring roll is just ok, don‚Äôt recommend this one if you have other choices."
Pho Bo Ga King (Somerset),5,"Pho Bo Ga King is my go-to destination when I'm in the mood for an authentic and satisfying bowl of Pho. This hidden gem has consistently delivered high-quality, delicious Vietnamese cuisine, and has won a special place in my heart.

The Pho here is exemplary. The broth is flavorful and rich, a testament to the hours spent simmering it to extract the full depth of flavors. The noodles are cooked just right, maintaining that essential bounce and bite, while the meat, whether you opt for beef or chicken, is tender and well-seasoned.

The star of the show is undoubtedly the Pho, but their menu offers a range of other mouth-watering Vietnamese dishes too. The spring rolls are crispy and flavorful, and the Bun Cha is another favorite, offering a great balance of textures and flavors.

Portions at Pho Bo Ga King are generous, making it great value for money. Additionally, they offer a variety of sauces and fresh herbs on the side, allowing you to customize your dish to your taste.

The staff here is always friendly and attentive, ensuring a pleasant dining experience. The environment is warm and cozy, making it a great place to enjoy a comforting meal on any day."
Pho Bo Ga King (Somerset),5,"I love this place. It was amazing. I got the beef vermicelli, and the chicken spring rolls. ABSOLUTELY my favourite meal ive ever had. Will be coming back. I think it was the time of day I came, but it was super quiet and peaceful and the environment was beautiful. I got to relax while eating my new favourite foods! Customer service was very nice and the people were very nice. Very clean restaurant. Props to the chef in the back. She did a great job with the meals. (I think it was a lady):) thank you Pho Bo Ga King!"
Pho Bo Ga King (Somerset),5,"Best pho in Ottawa based on my wife's, daughter's and my own opinions. We've visited a lot of pho places in Ottawa and Pho Bo Ga King has the best pho, especially the broth! Also if you order the rare beef, it is actually served rare and cook until tender in the soup. I really like that and this is not easy to find (most serve the beef completely overcooked). The Restaurant is a quiet place with a nice relaxed atmosphere, another big plus in my opinion. I have eaten there often with my wife and daughter, and we all enjoyed our food each time. All of us will definitely keep coming back. My daughter loves the bubble tea and my favorite is the #07 rare beef and tendon pho."

"Thai Express (50 Rideau Street, Unit FC006)",1,I ordered 2 Pad Thai. When I opened up my food it looked lole it was cooked with leftovers. It made my kid rock after eating it. I do not recommend going here. I wasted 32$ for nothing. Never coming here again.
"Thai Express (50 Rideau Street, Unit FC006)",2,Inconsistent. I usually order the chicken pad thai. Sometimes it's be bone dry and other times the noodles are soaking in the sauce.
"Thai Express (50 Rideau Street, Unit FC006)",2,"No consistency, you can order the same dish 50 times but you will get a range of very differently tasting dishes, with different contents, only noodles or rice will be true to order lol.
It almost seems like the person making it will make it as they would like it themselves. Today I got red curry and it wasn't even red it was that diluted!!!! No flavour whatsoever.
Giving two stars for the 20% of the time the curry tasted nice. My husband ate it so sorry no photo but I'm sure if u come back next time it will be the same"
"Thai Express (50 Rideau Street, Unit FC006)",5,"pad thai looks like a hot mess, but it actually tastes pretty good. veri nice, will come back again."
"Thai Express (50 Rideau Street, Unit FC006)",2,I know it was not an accident I said ‚Äú French Fried Rice with Basil and Shrimp I went today I was so excited I haven't had this in a while. I am so disappointed I wasted money and time never again now they are just not doing their jobs right giving people the wrong orders. I mean if you can't hear me say you can't and I will remove my mask for a bit so you can get my order right. I'm not going there again it's not worth the money for this location. I have never had a wrong order and the people are always so kind and gentle but this is ridiculous and not good customer service and two wrong orders. I hope it gets better or else I‚Äôll just order something else at the food court. But anyway instead of Shrimp I got Fish something I never order in just disappointed and upset now. My order wasn't even spicy and I said extra spicy never again.

GoForSushi,5,"Great lunch spot. Service is fast but courteous. I people watch from the coffeeshop across the hallway quite often, and have witnessed the service. Finally tried eating there recently and will definitely go back. Ready to eat sushi is decent, bento boxes take a couple minutes wait, but worth it. They have a couple of tables to sit at, but there‚Äôs plenty more seating space around the building if they run out."
GoForSushi,5,"Delicious! ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è
I will be back even though I live 30mins away."
GoForSushi,5,Amazing! Love it!
GoForSushi,5,Fresh and tasty!  Decent portions for the price.  You can grab a bento box to go or make a custom order.
Sherwood Market & Deli,5,"The service and the sandwich were amazing! I went for the first time today and got the chicken, bacon, and avocado sandwich. It was easily the best sandwich I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôll definitely be back again soon."
Sherwood Market & Deli,5,"Got a spicy salami sandwich - they made it w mozzarella, mustard, mayo, lettuce and tomato. The best part was the egg bread which was fluffy and soft. For the $7, this was hella worth it. Would go again."
Sherwood Market & Deli,4,"After hearing about the famous CBA sandwich, I decided to give it a try. It was a good sandwhich, but in my opinion nothing to write home about. There was a lot of lettuce, and the small amount of bbq chicken present was squashed up on one side. Not many tomatoes or avocado as well. The famous sauce seems to be a combination of mayo and mustard. That being said, the pricing ($7.49) and service was excellent, and the store appeared to sell other baked goods, so overall seems like a nice spot to return to."
Sherwood Market & Deli,5,"Tried the avocado and cheese sandwich after a doctors appointment one day, it was great! The egg bread they use is so fresh and everything was tasty. Really good portion too."
Sherwood Market & Deli,5,"This store looked like a regular corner store in the neighbourhood, but turns out a good sandwich place. Tried BBQ chicken bacon avocado sandwich and roast pork sandwich, and both of them were great. Meat was good, and bacon and avocado seem to make their sandwiches tastier. Their egg bread was fresh, sherwood sauce was good with lettuce and avocado. Their sandwiches are not fancy, but they were homestyle sandwiches (in a good way)."
Tealive,4,"Yimin Dim Sum House

Friend and I wanted to try this place, hard to find since it's combined with another restaurant all together.

We sit down and the place looks ok, alittle rough but I heard the dim sum is all made locally by hand, the orders start to arrive and it is really good, I would say the shrimp su mi was the best I have ever had.

After maybe 30 dimsum pieces the bill came to around 110$

Not very cheap, found it to be pretty expensive actually.

Overall still worth trying!
4/5"
Tealive,5,"What a hidden gem in Ottawa! The owner was super nice. The portion was super large so we ended up packing another two meals home üòã

We tried the fish maw soup - an authentic Chinese soup that has some jelly texture stuff in there. I really like it!

I also tried their special rice that comes in a clay pot called ‚ÄúÁÖ≤‰ªîÈ•≠‚Äù, the classic one is the one with the sausage. There are rice crusts on the pot which are super crispy. Overall very pleasant experience!"
Tealive,4,"Deep-Fried Football is my favourite! Who can refuse the sticky, savoury fried dim sum with leek and meat inside? Love it!"
Tealive,5,"Always come here with my family and it never disappoints! Big portions and big flavour!!

The eggplant and shrimp paste hot plate is always a hit and so are the stir fried noodles!

The staff is always so kind and give off great vibes "
Tealive,5,"Authentic and tasty Cantonese cuisine! It‚Äôs super affordable, too. What a great place.
The food arrived very quickly and was served by a nice lady.
The menu is very vast so it‚Äôs easy to get lost in it. If you don‚Äôt know what to order, you should try the beef dumplings and the noodle soup with chicken."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch  (179 Rideau Street),3,"The place is bit crowded in the mornings which is understandable but service is poor, we've had to wait at least 20 minutes just to order. The coffee and food was good. Tho I do think it's bit on the pricey side. Not many vegetarian options except for something with fruits. Nevertheless, not a bad place."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch  (179 Rideau Street),3,"Food was bland and poor tasting. I got eggs Benedict and there wasn't enough hollandaise sauce on it. The price was too high for the quantity of food. They sat us right in front of the cash so there was no privacy, despite most of the tables being empty when we arrived. Decorations and ambience was backdated and uninviting."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch  (179 Rideau Street),5,"The place is clean and cute. We arrived before 10 am on a Sunday, which seemed smart because it got busier after. Our server was really nice and smiley.
I ordered a savorini crepe with bacon and fruit salad, my husband goat and tomato omelete. Amazingly, all fruits were sweet!!! No sour pineapple or tasteless cantaloupe which has happened to me before in other places.
We enjoyed here very much. I Highly recommend here!!"
Cora Breakfast and Lunch  (179 Rideau Street),5,"Firstly, the service was superb. Yes, it was busy, filled with tourists. It looked like only one server was on duty, with another person assisting with refilling coffee and clearing tables. But that one single server, took care of everyone, with a friendly and attentive attitude, and a genuine smile. He was the most efficient waiter I have ever seen.  Compared to other restaurants we visited, he truly made our day. Funny, how an efficient friendly server can set the mood for the rest of the day.
Secondly, the food was superb. The ingredients were fresh and plentiful, beautifully presented and delicious. We had a fabulous experience,  thank you."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch  (179 Rideau Street),5,"We rolled in with four adults and four young kids and somehow they not only put up with us, but with amazing service, provided an excellent experience.

The staff deserve lots of praise for their patience and attentiveness."
Oat Couture Oatmeal Cafe,4,"Really chic and nicely furnished coffee / drink place. Space was spacious with a lot of room to move around and never get too crowded.
Coffee bar with oat meals and whisky bar standing next to each other.
Pretty nice except I do find their price is quite pricey for its offerings and very limited opening hours too‚Ä¶.. so I guess it‚Äôs more of a coffee place than a drinking hall because they close at 3 pm on a Sunday!!!"
Oat Couture Oatmeal Cafe,4,"good coffee! friendly service, lots of spacious seating - wish there was more espresso shots option for a $7 latte tho. would recommend checking out if you‚Äôre in the neighbourhood"
Oat Couture Oatmeal Cafe,4,"Tastefully designed cafe. The vibe is very mellow and comfy where you can study/work/hangout. Employees are all very happy and ready to help. There are a decent about of gluten free options on the menu which are clearly stated. The only issue I had is the writing on the board was very tiny so it was hard to read without my glasses. My brother and I both ordered the gluten free Nutella overnight oats. We got the small and found it very filling. In addition, its topped with fresh walnuts and bananas which really took it to the next level. I will definitely order this bowl again. We also ordered an iced Americano and cappuccino. Both coffees were decent and paired well with the sweet oatmeal. Overall we had a great experience and will be returning. The only improvement I can recommend is the value for product. The quality of the ingredients is good but i don‚Äôt know if it is worth the price."
Oat Couture Oatmeal Cafe,3,"I love oats so was pretty excited to try out this place. We got the seasonal bowl that was offered at the time with the orange blossom. The oats were cooked well and the bowl was flavourful but I only wished it came out hotter? For oatmeal, I would have to say it‚Äôs on the pricier side.
The place is very nicely decorated with a cool vibe and ambiance. It‚Äôs also attached to a whiskey bar which is pretty neat. Definitely a good place to come sit with friends and chill."
Oat Couture Oatmeal Cafe,5,"I've visited the bank street Oat Couture a few times and enjoyed it, but this one is way nicer on the inside. Spacious with lots of very comfortable seating. Overall awesome atmosphere! I think the menu might have changed since I last visited so I didn't get a chance to order my favorite bowl, but the one that we ordered was nice as well. I usually don't order coffee there since I don't find it to be great, at least at the bank street location, but it's totally worth a visit for the food and the atmosphere."
MEDITERRANEAN BAKERY AND PIZZA,5,"We have been coming here for the usual cheese pies for many years as they are some of the best in the city. Then, one day, we decided to try out their pizza,which is thin crust, and we were blown away. It is absolutely delicious, and our now go-to place for thin crust pizza (we are obsessed with just cheese on ours). Then last night,we found out they have chicken wings, so I ordered 20 hot ones for my 2 kids and I. And OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!! I kid you not, these are THE BEST chicken wings I have ever had in my life. They were super juicy and just fell off the bone. My mouth is watering just thinking about them now...
They should really advertise them more because they would make a killing. You definitely need to try them next time you go in for a cheese pie or pizza. You can thank me later!!!!!!
Wish I had taken a picture before because there is nothing left of them to show!!! I'll try to remember next time and add it to this review.
Enjoy!!!!!"
MEDITERRANEAN BAKERY AND PIZZA,5,"Opens early in the morning for hot and fresh pies. I visit here frequently since I got addicted to their meat & cheese pies. They serve XL pizza (10 slices) in a good variety of toppings and variations.

The seating is good. Their pies are always fresh!"
MEDITERRANEAN BAKERY AND PIZZA,5,Great food for a great price. The staff is nice and accommodating. The food you find here is a healthier choice than other fast food places. There's tons of parking but getting into the strip mall might be a bit problematic during busy times. It's a small shop so it can get busy fast however the staff is very efficient so it's not a problem.
MEDITERRANEAN BAKERY AND PIZZA,5,"This place is all around wonderful. Their manoush is the best I‚Äôve had,and it‚Äôs nut free which is good for someone like me with a nut allergy. My Lebanese bf loves that they have Laban Ayran and Bonjus. They are also just wonderful people. Super friendly and kind. I‚Äôve never had a bad experience with any of the staff. They also never laugh or seem annoyed with my Arabic attempts (going to Lebanon soon so I‚Äôm practicing).
I can‚Äôt accurately portray how wonderful this place is. A true gem of Ottawa. Try the za‚Äôatar manoush. You won‚Äôt regret it."
MEDITERRANEAN BAKERY AND PIZZA,1,Are these pies or bits of wood? They are too hard to eat the edges I don't buy pies to throw in the garbage and we gave them a forehand note but to no avail.
Sunset Grill (100 Marche Way),1,"Quality of food is absolutely horrendous. The eggs I order over easy,. They were literally just cooked on one side till there were rubberized, ask for well done sausage, came to me burnt, I wanted chewy bacon, it came to me barley cooked. I highly recommend not going there until they get proper cooks"
Sunset Grill (100 Marche Way),5,"Great restaurant with an amazing staff and a lot of menu options, we loved their fresh coffee and the California Benedict. Highly recommended"
Sunset Grill (100 Marche Way),2,"Super disappointed in my recent visit to sunset grill but only because of the food, the staff and service was excellent. The food however, was cold- tasted like it was microwaved. It was dull, portion was okay, it just didn't taste fresh nor good. The bacon even tasted microwaved. I was shocked because I know the kitchen is right there, open concept, but the taste did not represent freshly made food. The salmon plate was shocking. It was 2-3 slices of grey old looking smoked salmon, that came with 3 packaged cream cheese. Barely toasted bagel just sits there in a plate on the side and you build it. It just looks awful  and the presentation made me not want to eat it. I just don't understand how a restaurant with this type of location and constant customers has this level of quality? Unfortunate. Again, really sweet staff and bottomless coffee so that was a plus. Do better!"
Sunset Grill (100 Marche Way),5,"We visited the location in TOR three years ago and my daughter has raved that it was the best French Toast she's ever had.  We were thrilled to find a location in Ottawa. We had breakfast there one day and lunch the next! Love the staff, super friendly and the food is amazing!"
Sunset Grill (100 Marche Way),4,"We had the blueberry pancakes and the Southwest Vegan Hash. Pancake was ok, though the vegan hash was oily and without much taste or spice which I didn‚Äôt really like. It was filling however. You get free refills of the brewed coffee as well. They have maybe 2-3 vegan option and more vegetarian options which is nice. It has a nice vibe and service is pretty good, too."
Subway (Montreal Rd),4,Place is really clean. Server was really nice. Ordered tuna 6 ft long. Very delicious as made it saucy. Just wish they had a drink counter like a fountain drink dispenser which they don't have that is kinda sad. Ordered 2 cookies as well which the caramel chocolate cookies are amazing
Subway (Montreal Rd),5,"Best SUBWAY shop in Ottawa. Went in for the first time here N asked for Vege Sandwich. The guy AJ made the Sandwich which I never had anywhere in Canada here.
The guy is very Friendly, Jolly N warm welcoming.

Aj is super creative N made the subway superrrrr Delicious üòãüòç

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SUBWAY üíØ if u r anywhere in OTTAWA.

10/10 ‚úåÔ∏è"
Subway (Montreal Rd),3,"Yes, I have been to this Subway. And the service was very clean and friendly. They served me one of my favorite sub the meatball sub with it all dressed and the combo deal. It's really tasty and satisfying and a well priced sub. Well, it's been a while since then. So, I'll miss it. Good bye, Subway."
Subway (Montreal Rd),5,"Amazing customer service, plus they made my regular veggie sub amazing. Me and my friend ate in and couldn't finish so the employee at the front even wrapped the rest up for us to go. Overall they were very friendly and I would definitely recommend changing up your regular subway and coming to this one."
Subway (Montreal Rd),5,"As soon as I walked in I noticed how clean the business looked. As a past subway employee I knew how the business was run and this one was doing it correctly.
Friendly service from both the owner and his staff,  bright fresh vegetables. The sub I ordered was presented perfectly on a fresh baked bun, I really could not recommend this subway location enough, hopefully you have the same great experience I had"
Reynolds Restaurant,4,"New-ish to Ottawa, ordered from here  for the first time. Cole's notes: tasty and non-pretentious food, and great value for money. We would definitely order from here again! (For reference - Italian omelette and breakfast sandwiches, with an additional side of sausages and bacon). Only point of constructive feedback would be that the home fries were lacking in seasoning, but nothing a little salt, pepper, garlic powder, chili powder and ketchup from our home pantry couldn't fix.

We'd recommend to anyone who wants a decent food experience without feeling they need to cry into their wallets!"
Reynolds Restaurant,1,Use to love this place but I ordered delivery today and my eggs were over hard not easy and they changed the sausage and bacon which were both horrible and burned even the home fries were burned . Sorry guys won't be back. Response to the reply the eggs shouldn't be over hard for ordering delivery they do not cook inside the box second you must have just bought reynolds when it went up for sale cause that is not the sausage or bacon used by the original owners 3rd do you treat all reviewers like that just cause they didn't like it or can u learn to take criticism? The food was burned weather you like it or not. Get better cooks
Reynolds Restaurant,5,"I was surprised when we got here that it was located near Canadian Tire on Carling. It‚Äôs easy to get to and had a lot of parking when we went this morning. We walked in and it was cozy. It was already somewhat busy. We found a spot to sit near the back of the restaurant. Immediately, I noticed the prices were a great value for the food. We decided what we wanted and we both ordered the Combo # 2. It comes with 2 French toast, 2 eggs, bacon, toast and a small coffee. It was quick to receive our food. Then we were told to pay at the cash. It seemed strange not to get a receipt. Overall, it was a great experience."
Reynolds Restaurant,5,Amazing service! Amazing food! First time going today and it was the best decision üòä I love to support local and will definitely come back. Also I find their review responses hilarious and agree with everything they had to say. It drew me into their restaurant tbh. The prices are more than reasonable too. Keep up the great work. Complements to all the staff.
Reynolds Restaurant,5,"Lovely staff, very friendly. The food is delicious portions are a good size for the price. I try to come every weekend. This place is good and I will bring my visitors here when they come to the city."
John Juan Burrito,5,"This was my first visit, the line was really short, and the service was fast. I got the burrito bowl, they give you a lot, and a free tortilla as well. They have a great selection of drinks as well! I will definitely come back and try the nachos next time! I would love for them to have brown rice, one day as well :-)"
John Juan Burrito,5,"Came for a late night light snack.

Got the best brotherly burrito service ever. Dude hit me with a monster mix. And before I knew it, I was leaving the store feeling like an absolute beast, ready to devour what looks like a 3 course meal. No regrets. Place is a delicious hidden gem."
John Juan Burrito,5,"Came here to for the first time today a friend recommended the steak and Holly steak was it good. I got the large and it was stuffed with fresh ingredients. Packed. Clean place, quick service even though I could tell they were really busy with online orders and quality made. I'll be back"
John Juan Burrito,4,We recently came to this place as a first timer in early Nov 2021. We didn't have much expectation coming in and we were blown away. The staff was helpful in explaining to us what was good and the portion sizes was quite big. We ordered the meat taco salad and steak burrito bowl. They didn't disappoint. We felt the price we paid was worth the size and quality of the dishes we ordered!
John Juan Burrito,4,"Order door dash. Quantity was good and taste was decent too. For the price u pay, totally worth it!"
Geenie Bakery,5,"Great service, staff and owner are very kind and treat the customers with respect and hospitality, amazing food made right in-front of your very own eyes too. Would highly recommend the chicken pizzas and the meat and cheese pie with the spices. 10/10 favourite spot to go for lunch breaks üëç"
Geenie Bakery,5,"Great food, definitely some of the best cheese, meet and zatar pies I've had. Great service, and kind owners. Definitely more of a take out spot, though there is patio chairs out from"
Geenie Bakery,5,"The food was amazing and the service was great also.
We're very happy there's a great Lebanese restaurant in Blackburn now!
Looking forward to the next visit!"
Geenie Bakery,5,Blackburn Hamlet is lucky to have this treasure! There are lots of great items on the menu and this is a good place to grab lunch to go.
Geenie Bakery,5,Great food. They have a special dough that I have not seen anywhere. It is thin but airy. The owners are lovely people and pies are simply the best.
Cadmans Montreal Bagels ((Mtl rd & Vanier Pkwy),4,"It's conveniently located, but nothing like Kettleman's Bagel Store. Nice variety in sandwiches and menu, but the interior seemed a but congested, too busy, with bars around. Should be a big open concept(interior) so it feels more homey, sandwich place. Lighting should be bright.
Their bagels were great though. ‚ò∫"
Cadmans Montreal Bagels ((Mtl rd & Vanier Pkwy),5,"Incredible food! Bagel was super fresh, cream cheese was out of this world, and nothing around compares to the birria tacos! Josh is an incredible chef and his passion really shows in the food."
Cadmans Montreal Bagels ((Mtl rd & Vanier Pkwy),5,My boyfriend took me there for breakfast and it was super yummy. I had a breakfast bagel combo. I was surprised at the affordability and quality. I also prefer the environment over the competition. It's a lot more relaxed and comfortable. The staff are very friendly as well. I will definitely go back.
Cadmans Montreal Bagels ((Mtl rd & Vanier Pkwy),3,I go here almost weekly for Bagels and normally breakfast. Twice now their point of sale wasn't working so I couldn't buy anything and once they didn't have anyone there to make the sandwiches. Its very frustrating to be a regular customer who likes the product and can't get it 3 times in 4 months. Unfortunately a poorly run place that will lose regular customers.
Cadmans Montreal Bagels ((Mtl rd & Vanier Pkwy),1,"I've tried to give cadmans multiple chances, every time I ask for a toasted bagel it never is toasted. Just warmed. Then today I ask for olive cream cheese, very little olives but then I bite into a big olive pit! It hurt my tooth, it actually chipped my tooth! I'm never going to this shop again, overpriced for poor quality"
Little Caesars (355 Montreal Rd.),1,I use to have my lunch from here 6 days a week but had to go on a 2 week. Reak from them because the new employees don't know how to make the food. Tried today after 2 weeks and was disgusting.  Hopefully the owner comes back and fixes this. 40$ a week gone from me for now
Little Caesars (355 Montreal Rd.),1,I ordered online and followed along thru the app. I was told it was in the oven and then alerted that it was done and ready for pickup. I went in and they had not even started it. And they lied to me about it being in the oven. Once I saw the counter guy asking someone if they could start it I canceled the order. What a waste of my time. I have even less faith in the app than before.
Little Caesars (355 Montreal Rd.),1,Maybe if they put the ingrediants on my pizzas instead of in there mouths then Id get a little more pizza and less crust.
Little Caesars (355 Montreal Rd.),5,"Super fresh ,taste amazing,fresh ingredients and such kind friendly staff."
Little Caesars (355 Montreal Rd.),2,"Quality and customer service has gone downhill.

I used to be regular customer at this location. The pizza quality has deteriorated - I received a pizza that had way too much crust (which tastes like cardboard) and far less ingredients.

Its also super difficult to grab the attention of the employees. I've come in multiple times only to be ignored by passing employees and be kept waiting for 5-10 minutes.

It's time for them to step up their game...."
Juice Dudez,5,"I tried the rainbow dude, mango juice and the fruit waffle with white and dark chocolate. The place is really nice. The moment you open the door, you see fruits lying around everywhere üòÇ.. but it looks good and suits the place. I loved the rainbow dude, the combination of strawberry and mango with other fruits is really amazing. No wonder they sell 200+ rainbow dudes per dayü´°.

The fruit waffle had 2 waffle pieces and a ton of whip cream. I wish they add more waffle than having 4 scoops of cream. Still the waffle was great.

Loved everything here. The service was great and there is street parking right outside the place."
Juice Dudez,5,"Visited Juie Dudez with my family & we loved the food, atmosphere & friendly staff.
All the ingredients were fresh & amazing.

I would like to specifically mention about the freshness of the fruits they added for the fruity waffle. My toddler loved the fresh fruits.
This is a must visit cafe in Ottawa."
Juice Dudez,5,"One of my fav finds in Ottawa, genuinely the most kind and caring staff. The rainbow juice dude is my go to and full of great flavour! Super informative and a great attention to detail. Healthy but also satisfied my sweet tooth. The owner went out of his way to introduce himself, asked for real feedback and continues to make a great impact on the community."
Juice Dudez,5,"The best place for juices and desserts in town.
We were invited by Mr. Nasr to their Richmond location and were treated royally. My most favourite drink there is Rainbow Dude, you do not use a straw for this drink.
Everything was so fresh and yummy as they use fresh fruits top quality nuts and other ingredients.  Service is 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è
You have to have to try it guys.
Two locations to serve you in Ottawa.

Thank you Juice Dudez for such a great experience!"
Juice Dudez,4,"Great place for desserts, juices, and smoothies! They're open till late at night, so you can fulfill some late night cravings. The sitting arrangement is decent, but you may need to wait for dine-in if all seats are taken. They should rearrange some furniture/shelf to add some more dine-in space.

We tried fruity waffle and rainbow dude juice. In Fruity waffle, they were pretty generous with fruits, and waffle was really nice and fresh. However, the waffle was small in size. The overall experience was amazing and worth trying all items on their menu."
Roberto's Corner,5,This place is a hidden gem! Best Italian deli sandwich I've ever had. The staff was crazy nice. I went and the place was packed and they still had me in and out in less than 5-8mins. If your looking for a great little lunch spot then this is the place.
Roberto's Corner,5,"Today was my first time going. There was a Subway at this location when I went to school and had heard good things about the new sandwich shop. I will also say good things.

Was greeted by very nice, well mannered staff. They let me choose what I wanted on my sandwich, which many true Italian delis rarely do. The sandwich had lots of everything, no skimping on meat here.

Also bought a connoli, butter tart, and cookie to split with my wife. We enjoyed all 3.

Try the spicy oil."
Roberto's Corner,5,"What a gem, accidentally found at the back of gas station, which is currently in renovation...I work in the area and was searching for something fast and relatively nutritious to eat. Their sandwiches are amazing! The quality of bread, cold cuts, toppings and sauces is great. My sandwich (Italian cold cuts with eggplant etc.) was delicious. Very reasonably priced and fast & polite service. I ill be back for sure, and not once!"
Roberto's Corner,4,"Tried this place last week for the first time and have been a second time since then. Tried both the trio and chicken parm. The trio is now my fav and probably what I‚Äôll order from now on. The young gentleman working when I went for the first time were so nice and polite and had no issues guiding me through the order and made some good suggestions. There was an older gentleman working alone the second time I went in, he was ok, not overly friendly and pretty sure he ignored some things I asked/ said."
Roberto's Corner,5,Excellent Italian sandwiches where you can specify the ingredients. Sandwiches are  around 8-12 $ with generous fillings.  There are also salads such as pasta salads etc.  I liked the chicken Parmesan sandwich  especially. A few desserts also There is also individual dishes that you can take home to up like tortellini and lasagna and similar.  Also have samosas including vegetarian ones. They carry  Italian soft drinks
Wellington Diner,5,"Had a very pleasant dining experience at this place. The server was very accommodating and incredibly friendly. The food was also tasty and arrived promptly. We sat outside, so I can't comment on the indoor location, but I can tell that the outdoor ambiance was very much welcoming and well curated.
Prices were absolutely fair given the quantity of food per plate.
Considering this was my first time eating here, I'd greatly recommend this diner."
Wellington Diner,4,"Excellent home style food served plentiful and hot. Great service. Really cool and entertaining decor. A huge patio awaits those who prefer summer outdoor dining‚Ä¶ but if you prefer indoors, they have 2 levels of booths and tables to accommodate either small or large parties, as well those who‚Äôd like t√™te √† t√™te! Bring your appetite as portions are delicious and large. Try and save room for one of their famous sundaes. Try one of their famous milk shakes too‚Ä¶"
Wellington Diner,5,"My daughter and I popped in today around 1245 for brunch (lunch for me, breakfast for her). She likes to watch some extreme eater  and was excited he had been to ottawa. So she wanted to see where he was. It was busy when we got there, as it was a weekend . But we were seated immediately. Service was fast. She was delighted by the hot chocolate presentation, and chocolate chip pancakes with a side of bacon (10 year-old breakfast of dreams). I opted for a Kentucky chicken sandwich. It was well seasoned. Crispy. And paired perfectly with the toppings. Overall good good and food service. I had been looking for a place to replace Baker's street as my go-to. I think I found it."
Wellington Diner,5,Visited Quebec last weekend and our Saturday morning breakfast landed here. Great place. Great atmosphere. Great service. And great food. All the posters and memorabilia they have will keep you busy for hours. Highly recommended.
Wellington Diner,5,"Love this place! The portions are always big. It's a fun vibe for brunch. The staff are friendly, and keep your coffee full. I highly recommend the ""Swipe Right Benny"". I've also had steak and eggs here before, and like the peppercorn they put on the steak."
Edo Japan -  College Square,4,"Edo Japan has bubble tea now!! For a place that doesn't specialize in bubble tea, I have to admit, it's pretty good. I was afraid that the tapioca pearls would be all hard and gross, but they were soft and springy. I've had the Brown Sugar Boba Milk with tapioca pearls and the Passion Fruit Green Tea with Coconut Jelly. Both were delicious! I like that you can get regular sweetness or half sweet (I got half sweet). I would like it more if I had the option of no added sugar at all. The drinks are only $4.95 each and on Double Bubble Mondays they are 2 for $7 (every Monday).

I've had the food at Edo Japan too and it's pretty good for fast food. They have upped their game since the 1990s, which is like the last time I had them before I gave them another chance in 2021 and was impressed, so I've been more of a regular customer since 2021. Love their Bento boxes and noodle bowls."
Edo Japan -  College Square,3,"We ordered two bento boxes. The teriyaki chicken and shrimp were pretty good, the spring rolls were good, the gyoza were ok, and the tempura shrimp were good. A little pricey but we did feel quite full afterwards. The rice was ok, didn't taste fresh or good quality."
Edo Japan -  College Square,3,Ordered the Veggie Sushi Platter and it was not bad. The Cucumber and Avocado just had 1 slice of it. More as well as smaller pieces would have been nice.
Edo Japan -  College Square,3,"Fair portion, but I didn't find the taste good (but not that had either). The store operates more like fast food. The store itself is quite bland with some tables to sit at."
Edo Japan -  College Square,5,This is a family favourite for takeout because everyone gets exactly what they want. The bento boxes are especially awesome because you can choose any two out of nine (!) sides. The shrimp tempura is better than AYCE places and takes out surprisingly well.
Punjabi Canteen,5,"May 2023
Our group of 9 shared all of our items ordered, and the vote was a raving review of the food. Our friends were searching for a caterer for their wedding, and they found it.
We ordered what we wanted, and then shared the plates.
Appetizers ordered: samosas (only vegetarian are served), pakoras, and onion bhaji.
Mains ordered: butter chicken, aloo Gobi, paneer tikka, lamb kebab, tandoori chicken, salmon tikka, white rice, coconut rice, pulao rice, naan bread, roti, and pappadam.
Everything was delicious, flavourful, and tasty.
Our waitress was great for helping us out with how much we needed to order.
A cozy space tucked away in a Manotick mall.
I live 45 minutes away from this restaurant, but I would make the drive across the city to come here for meal.
Hopefully, your experience here will be as great as ours!"
Punjabi Canteen,4,Good addition to Ottawa‚Äôs South Asian food palate. Loved samosa chat and gol grappa. Masala chai was sweet. I would have preferred an option of having sugar on the side. Very neat and clean dining area.
Punjabi Canteen,1,The worst experience ever. Picked up Papdi & Aloo Tiki chat and pakoras. The chats were so dry with literally few drops of dahi and hardly any chutney. The pictures attest to what I am saying.  The chats and pakoras had no taste or flavor. Only took few bites and had to throw away the rest. Such a disappointing experience. If this restaurant wants to establish a good clientele they need to improve their food quality
Punjabi Canteen,5,"The packaging was neat and secure, and I was pleased to find that the food was still warm when I opened it at home. The aroma of the spices and herbs in the Briyani was incredible, and it was clear that the chefs had put a lot of thought and care into creating this dish.

The rice was fluffy and flavorful, and the tender lamb pieces were cooked to perfection. The spices used in the dish were well-balanced, giving it a depth of flavor that was truly impressive. The accompanying raita was fresh and cooling, which balanced the heat of the dish.

The portion size was generous and could easily feed two people. The value for the price was excellent, and the quality of the food was unmatched.

Overall, I had a fantastic experience with this Briyani takeout, and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and authentic Briyani experience."
Punjabi Canteen,5,Ordered beef biryani and chaat papri. Biryani was amazing and spice level is very good. Meat was tender and flavourful. Chaat papri was a bit dry but asked for extra yogurt and tamarind chutney and it was perfect after.
E. T. Cafe,5,"Truly, a hidden gem! I‚Äôm so glad that I found this place, as their food and customer service is top-notch. I got the chicken club sandwich combo with fries, and wow, so delicious! However, they season the chicken for this club sandwich was so yummy. Will definitely go here again."
E. T. Cafe,5,"I love this caf√©, the muffins and iced coffee are great! The staff are friendly, the seating is comfortable and clean. I've tried lunch here before as well and had a good experience. Overall if you're in the neighborhood or stopping in for an appointment definitely check this place out. üòÅüëçüèª"
E. T. Cafe,5,I love this place I have never been disappointed with the quality of the food or the service. Great value great pricing great food!
E. T. Cafe,5,"We randomly discovered this place during a visit to that complex and I am so glad we did. The food was made fresh, tasted great. The service was super friendly and the prices were great too. Would totally recommend. Sorry I don‚Äôt have photos."
E. T. Cafe,5,"Extremely pleasant, tasty food, wonderful service, immaculately maintained."
Barburrito (Hunt Club),5,"This food was fantastic!!! So fresh, sosoooo good. Staff were kind and friendly.

Its my first time trying Mexican and they were so helpful. When i got the burrito it was so rich and tasty!!

I recommend the shrimp.

The negative comments about service seem to be very outdated, since new ownership i had a 10/10 experience"
Barburrito (Hunt Club),1,I have been there 3-4 times. Hoping for service to get better but no luck. I love burritos but this place doesn‚Äôt have fresh vegetables. Staff looks like they don‚Äôt want to serve you.
Barburrito (Hunt Club),2,"First time at this place. Burritos were so so. While my order was being prepared, another staff member came along and began preparing another order, each time reaching across my server to get the guac and the sauces, rather than walking around to access or asking for it to be passed to her.. While she did this her shirt brushed against my food more than once. After the 2nd time I told her - she just shrugged and said, oh sorry! I was not impressed."
Barburrito (Hunt Club),3,The last few times I‚Äôve been to this place they always have payment issues. Either their debit machine doesn‚Äôt work or the last time I was there they wouldn‚Äôt accept cash and made me pay debit. What a confusing way to deal with customers.
Barburrito (Hunt Club),1,"Before new management the proportion and level of service was perfect. But now after new management, the proportions especially is for-sure cut significantly short. The other time I got a regular and it ended being a small. They skimped out on all ingredients even sauces. I wish they wouldn‚Äôt at least give us the proportion as advertised‚Ä¶"
Walmart (2277 Riverside Dr.),3,Ok but expansive
Cadmans Montreal Bagels,3,"They are usually consistent with good and fresh sesame bagels, but if you want anything other flavors or pastries, forget about it. I asked for chocolate bagels and got packed raison/cranberry instead?? One time for breakfast I tried two very overpriced ""chocolate puffs"" that were stale beyond comprehension. This place clearly doesn't care too much about quality."
Cadmans Montreal Bagels,5,For Ten10 Bucks I always grab the Cheddar Habanero bagel Toasted with Herbs and garlic cream cheese with a slice of cheese and a slice of turkey. Two for 10 bucks plus tax can‚Äôt go wrong.
Cadmans Montreal Bagels,5,"Great little place, not overly busy. Very efficient and amazing products. Will be back for sure! Keep up the good work."
Cadmans Montreal Bagels,2,"I love Montreal style bagels, so I was happy to find this place in Ottawa. Bagels were decent and had many options to choose from.

However, customer service really let me down. The people working there seemed like they didn't want to be there. The cashier was so soft spoken we had to ask her several times to repeat herself. The tables were all dirty, and it's not like the place was busy either. The other thing that shocked me was, I saw one of the employees scratching her butt with her hand...
The coffee there was subpar as well."
Cadmans Montreal Bagels,1,"I was at the Carling location. The first thing I noticed was the bagel oven was not on and there were no fresh bagels to be had. So, I picked up half a dozen bagged bagels and a cream cheese container which I quickly felt was wet and oily (from the malfunctioning fridge they are in, the unconcerned clerk said). As I looked around after I paid, all I saw was filth. It doesn't look like this place has been cleaned in years!! The floor and all surfaces were grimy. Unacceptable for a place that sells food! Not sure what the owner/manager is thinking but I'll not return."
STACKED Smoked meat,4,Had am wonderful lunch at Stacked. It was a large group and the service was great. The waitress was quick with drinks but the food was slow coming out which is why I took off a star. The smoked meat was just incredible! I ordered a 6oz and it looked like a 12oz. Super huge portions!  The restaurant was very clean but very warm‚Ä¶.felt like we were sitting outside. Overall a great place to eat. Very reasonably priced and YES I would eat here again.
STACKED Smoked meat,5,"Great dinner type restaurant ; Loved our meals! Great selection on menu to smoked meats, burgers, salads, steaks,  awesome Mac N Cheese and cakes! Big Portions and reasonable prices! Our waitress was friendly and service was quick! The place has pool tables and large booths and accomodated our children with a kids menu and coloring crayons. Would definitely recommend."
STACKED Smoked meat,5,"Lots of different menu items for all tastes. It seemed like smoked meat was their specialty, but I actually ordered the BLT sandwich, which was very good, especially with the bacon! üôÇ

On my second visit, I had to try the smoked meat. It was ok, but nowhere near as good as Schwartz's. It was a tad on the bland side, but at least it was extremely tender."
STACKED Smoked meat,4,"We ordered the take out special and a poutine - the smoked meat was lean, and very tender and the bread was very fresh.  The poutine was good, nice amount of cheese and gravy. Everything was delicious and the order was ready in 15 mins. Service was great - everyone was friendly and pleasant."
STACKED Smoked meat,4,"Very nice place to dine in. Staff are super friendly. Decor was fresh. Overall, a pleasant experience. We'll be back. I got the smoked meat poutine and it was amazing. I like smoked meat and Stacked did not disappoint. Very well done. üòÅ"
Broadway Bar & Grill (Orleans),5,"We were a table of 8, and our server was very patient when taking our orders, even though some of us couldn't make up their minds. She was very personable too, and at one point even had a discussion with my friend about Taylor Swift's world tour.

For myself, I was short on time, so the server put in my order ahead of the others, which I appreciated very much."
Broadway Bar & Grill (Orleans),5,Been coming here for decades! Always for breakfast as I feel their specialty is their top tier home fries (extra onion for me!) Service always on point and pretty quick to serve the food. Will continue to be a family fave for years ro come.
Broadway Bar & Grill (Orleans),5,"This was our first visit and we were suitably impressed. We were there during the Sunday, late-morning rush. This place is very efficiently run. Our wait time was about 15 minutes. The staff are very focused and provide excellent and attentive service. Our server was Bryson and he proved to be a very efficient, engaging and attentive staff member. Very professional, informative and on point. The breakfast/brunch menu is widely varied. Their signature home fries are just that. Anything but bland, fried just right, with garlic and onion. Lovely. The food is delicious and served in generous portions.

We will certainly be going back. It was a great experience."
Broadway Bar & Grill (Orleans),5,"Been to this location a good handful of times for dinner and my favorite thing has always been their fries.  They're always crispy and golden brown.  Never burnt.  Have always been satisfied with pretty much anything on their menu.  This time around we had the Ultimate Steak Sandwich and the Nashville Chicken Sandwich.  I wanted my steak medium, and it was perfectly cooked.  My son's Nashville Chicken Sandwich was excellent as well.  Service was also very good.  Thank you."
Broadway Bar & Grill (Orleans),4,"This location is really convenient for me and have been many times. Bar type environment and has some TVs to keep you entertained. Expect to wait for breakfast on weekends, they get really busy. The breakfast potatoes are always on point. For dinners and drinks, They do have great specials, be sure to ask because not all servers tell you. My favorites are the Margaritas , the Bellini and the Chicken Greek Plate :) Took off one star because the Hostesses have often been a little rude/uninterested and food can take a little long to get served when they're very busy although usually worth the wait. Overall recommend !"
Broadway Bar & Grill (Riverside South),4,"The food was great and the place was clean. Only complaint would be that the salt and pepper wings were too salt. I know usually u get this type of wings salt is an ingredient but that was a lot. The milk shake however was heavenly, I enjoyed it and my son loved it so much I had to get another. Also go for wings on Tuesday it‚Äôs half off with the purchase of a beverage. The honey garlic wings were great also."
Broadway Bar & Grill (Riverside South),1,"We had the worst Broadways ever
Boneless chicken was uneatable because it was so salty, the two pasta plates were too cold, and the steak on taco salad was too hard. There was a problem with service, I don't know if the chef changed or if it was a kitchen issue, but everything was not right."
Broadway Bar & Grill (Riverside South),5,"I last dines here for breakfast, but have been here many times in the past.  Food is always great.  I especially love the home fries. Today, our server Lukas was amazing.  Fantastic service, especially when the restaurant is at full capacity, so obviously great management team to keep great service throughout."
Broadway Bar & Grill (Riverside South),5,"Good  food and good value for money!
Loved the sinful waffle and the hot chocolate! Waffles come with coffee/tea, so cool!
My husband and I shared the waffle and they brought it cut up in half and divided into two plates which made it super easy for us !! Now that‚Äôs great service!"
Broadway Bar & Grill (Riverside South),5,"Large portions, fast service, friendly staff, and most importantly, the food was fantastic!"
Cinnabon St Laurent,3,"Honestly dissatisfied with the portion of food I got for $15.

The host who took our order was really excellent and kind. Her work in being a professional and helpful raised this to a 3 star rating.

Sorry Perkins - I've liked your food but I felt really let down seeing what I got."
Cinnabon St Laurent,5,"Came for the friendly atmosphere, stayed for the Peanutbutter Silk Pie!
One of the best chains I have visited! Been to Ottawa 3 times and all three times I have visited here!"
Cinnabon St Laurent,3,This place was highly rated. The wait time wasn‚Äôt that long it was very busy so this seemed to be the spot to have breakfast and brunch. We enjoyed the build a breakfast. The crispy hash could have been more crispy. The biscuits were dry. The waffle was very delicious and tasty. The service was good but he was very quite.. could not hear him in a loud busy restaurant
Cinnabon St Laurent,4,"I came here to try their breakfast. We ordered the big country skillet and magnificent seven. The food was delicious and the staff were very friendly! I'd definitely come back here, especially for their pies!"
Cinnabon St Laurent,5,"Always love the food here every time. Got build a breakfast and glass of milk for breakfast for $20 with 2 slices of bacon, 3 pancakes, 2 eggs, and fried shredded potatoes. Our table of 11 were served our food within probably 15 mins at 9:15AM on a Thursday. Always friendly service and good food at a reasonable price. Been eating breakfast here occasionally since 2016, and it has never been a less than great experience."
New York Fries (Billings Bridge Plaza),5,"Best fries in the area! Always cooked crispy and the food tastes fresh. Super friendly manager, she‚Äôs extremely knowledgeable. Good recommendations with toppings that pair well together with certain poutines/hot dogs, etc. Definitely will be trying all poutine flavours and will return. Thanks!"
New York Fries (Billings Bridge Plaza),5,Great staff! Very pleasant experience. I will definitely be going back! Manager was super friendly (i believe her name was Acacia) 10/10!
New York Fries (Billings Bridge Plaza),5,"Great location, delicious food. The manager was also SUPER helpful and friendly. Would 10/10 recommend!!"
New York Fries (Billings Bridge Plaza),1,Never again this location is disgusting.... the fries were over cooked and ordered a poutine and they forgot to put gravy like seriously ridiculous pricing for this nasty stuff
New York Fries (Billings Bridge Plaza),5,"What happened with The New York Fries I knew? The fries are almost raw, since about a month ago. What happened? If this continues, I will never buy from you again.

Update: service has improved since then. Just ask them to have the fries well done. Problem solved!

Update 2: the crew that‚Äôs now serving on Sundays is super!"
Quelque Chose Macaron Boutique,4,"We came here for their tea time, which was great. The scone that they served was in my view perfect: it was light rather than cakey, somehow thin and tender. It melted away in the mouth, almost like a buttery and salty cotton candy. I chose the St Petersburg tea, a caramel black tea that went well with the macarons, which were succulent and fresh. The platter, as you can see, emphasized sugar, with only the bottom layer being savoury, and we found this a little disappointing, since the desserts (while superb) were overpowering and so we took them home in a box."
Quelque Chose Macaron Boutique,5,"This place is adorable! On Mother‚Äôs Day my sister, mother, step mother and myself had a reservation for ‚Äúle petit afternoon tea‚Äù on their roof top patio and it was perfect. The service was great, the setting was cozy and well set up and the food, tea and mimosas were delicious! We‚Äôve decided to make it a regular place to visit for our get togethers!"
Quelque Chose Macaron Boutique,5,"Great bakery and cafe in Westboro village, Ottawa, specializing in macarons and high tea. We have visited several times. The servers are always prompt and friendly. The food is delicious and reasonably priced, considering the quality!"
Quelque Chose Macaron Boutique,3,"Lovely spot to go for a high tea. The staff is friendly and the space has secret garden vibe. My friends and I ordered the petite high tea which came with tea, scones, croissants and macarons. They had a gluten free option for me which was great. Everything tasted good, but everything on the tower was very sweet. We all agreed that we wished the petite tower was more balanced and had a mix of sweet and savoury. Our favourite part was the macarons- specifically the Nutella, lemon and candy cane flavours. Overall this is a must try in the area! I will most likely be returning to try more options."
Quelque Chose Macaron Boutique,4,"Great macarons! The coffee was okay, and it‚Äôs a bit pricey but best macarons I‚Äôve had in Ontario. The flavours are imaginative and the design and colours pair so well."
The Baker,5,I liked their crispy meat pies. They are always kind and do fast service. Now they have new product. You should order in advanced sometimes you can find on sale if you are in your lucky day. It's look like sushi rolls but bakeries. I tasted it and like it very much. Good for gatherring with your family or friends.
The Baker,5,"I've been going to The baker for a long time. The transformation and dedication is incredible.  I think these guys deserve high praise. Best meat pies in the city. I know theres a few other good option but hands down the service and food is excellent.  Recommend to try the Akawwi cheese pie as they're 1000% better than regular cheese.

The aesthetic in the place is cute. Food is delish and service is top. Owner always has a smile on his face."
The Baker,5,"First time trying out The baker today and I'm already hooked! Right when we walked in we were greated with friendly smiles and amazing smells. Once we told them it was our first time trying the pie's out they went out of their way to make sure we had a great experience.
Im happy they suggested the Chicken, Sausage and Basil & Halloumi. All were super fresh, soft with crispy edges, and loaded with fillings.
The place was fairly busy around 2pm but the food came out within 5 minutes. Great food to walk and eat or bring home considering theres no indoor dining. All the staff are working hard and seem to be having a fun, great vibes all around. Cant wait to come back and try all the other flavors!"
The Baker,5,The baker is always amazing. My all time favourite is the chicken and cheese. The Akkawi cheese is also so good. Every time I visit Ottawa it‚Äôs one of my must have places. I could eat them every day!
The Baker,5,Absolutely the best pies with the best selection. Made fresh and served hot. Definitely a must try! The owner is so nice and friendly. 10/10 would recommend :)
7-Eleven (710 W 6th Ave),4,"It's very tiny cozy cornery Tim Hortons. To my view gets 4 out of 5 because I found food tastes a bit old.
Parking is limited but it's convenient in the area which you have to pay anywhere else for Parking.
I keep going whenever pass by"
7-Eleven (710 W 6th Ave),4,"Clean Tim Hortons that gets quite busy but in the evening it is slower. The parking is somewhat of a disaster and limited but it‚Äôs a good place to watch cars drive by.
Staff are really friendly. Donuts weren‚Äôt as fresh as other places but I think this location is nice enough especially kept clean. The baked goods selection is limited."
7-Eleven (710 W 6th Ave),5,"I had a steak, egg, and cheese biscuit and it was so got darn good! I love the fact that they use real eggs and not powder eggs or microwave frozen eggs. My biscuit was so soft. I will greatly miss this delicious breakfast sandwich!"
7-Eleven (710 W 6th Ave),5,"I dealt with a very sweet person in a hijab and wearing a queen pin, (yesterday around 3-4pm) she was very nice and easily the best customer service I‚Äôve seen at a tims."
7-Eleven (710 W 6th Ave),4,"I had the Cilantro Lime Chicken bowl.
It's good. I have had it 4 or 5 times since it came out.

Plus an Extra Large Steeped Tea and a donut.

It was a relaxing time."
Subway (Granville),3,"The woman who was working today 01/22/23 made me repeat myself on everything I said for my order like she couldn't hear me and acting rude about it like I was her child. I almost felt like she was pretending not to hear me so she could act annoyed and constantly get to question me in a tone so mid way I spoke up assuming for her benefit she couldn't hear me even though I was speaking loud and clear, she then looked at me with a nasty annoyed look and continued to make me repeat myself like I was incompetent to order my own sandwich. Felt like she was enjoying being a brat."
Subway (Granville),5,"Great customer service. Was acknowledged and welcomed with a smile upon entrance, offered extra options and continuously asked for approval on amount/presentation of sandwich. I was quite shocked about it actually!"
Subway (Granville),1,"The employee was rude , cheese fell to the side and she grabbed it and tried to put it in my sub. The sub was a mess and when I opened it when I got home it was a giant mess. She should get some more training if she‚Äôs going to be working alone."
Subway (Granville),5,Very nice person on morning shift üëçI can 't imagine myself to listen peoples problems at 6am and be still so nice to everybody ‚ù§Ô∏è big Like to that guy .)
Subway (Granville),1,"The server was a girl was very rude. When I told her to spilt my bill into 2 she very rudely replied that is not an option. When I further requested her to be aware of these things she replied that I should go to the place where they do spilt the bills and told me to get out of the store. She also did not give me the receipt, I had to request her for the receipt. I had an awful experience with the store and the lady server w as not even ready to give her name."
Freshslice Pizza (6374 Fraser Street),3,"Call in. Ordered x-large VEGAN CHEESE vegetarian pie. Specified WELL DONE to avoid soggy crust.
Arrived just as it was ready.
Saggy, soggy pie. NOT well done.
Rather tasteless.
Disappointing really.
The edge crust was quite good though."
Freshslice Pizza (6374 Fraser Street),3,"I selected Fresh Slice Pizza today (for lunch) over the few other pizza places on Fraser Street as this location was recently renovated.  Overall, it's decent pizzas (med Hawaiian and pepperoni). Cheesy bread could be better. And chicken wings, although drenched in BBQ sauce, wasn't bad. We actually ordered plain chicken wings as per my receipt, but for some reason, we were given BBQ chicken wings instead. I only found out about the wrong order, only after I took home my orders and opened the container. They provided me with ranch sauce as well, which was useless. Also, my order took longer than what I expected. Online order indicated it will be ready for pickup in 20 minutes. It was more like 35 minutes, so I had to sit and wait for longer than I wanted to. I'll be trying the other pizza places first before deciding to try Fresh Slice again."
Freshslice Pizza (6374 Fraser Street),5,Harleen and harshness needs a pay raise as they are so friendly to me. Harleen even remade me the pizza when she dropped it by accident and was very apologetic. Very great customer service
Freshslice Pizza (6374 Fraser Street),5,"I recently tried Fresh Slice Pizza Store for the first time and I must say, it was an absolute delight! The pizza was delicious and fresh, and the service was top-notch. From the moment I walked in, the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. They made sure my order was customized to my liking and were very patient with me.

The pizza itself was amazing! The crust was crispy and flavorful, the sauce was just the right amount of tangy and sweet, and the toppings were fresh and plentiful. I was impressed with the variety of options available, from classic toppings like pepperoni and mushroom to more unique options like goat cheese and arugula.

In addition to the pizza, I also ordered some garlic knots and they were just as tasty. They were soft, chewy, and packed with garlicky goodness.

Overall, I highly recommend Fresh Slice Pizza Store to anyone looking for delicious, fresh pizza and excellent customer service. The quality of their food and the friendliness of their staff make this a five-star establishment in my book!"
Freshslice Pizza (6374 Fraser Street),5,"Great place to visit, great customer service, friendly staff. Food tastes deliciousssssüòçü•≥üòÄüòãüòã"
Davie Dosa Company,5,Amazing experience with David Dosa Company.. Such a wonderful delicious food and humble service. Especially an open looking sitting like patio feel in Summer time. I was really impressed by Davie Dosa company South Indian Restaurant. I Proudly recommend those who like to have South Indian Cuisine. Thank you Davie Dosa company.
Davie Dosa Company,3,Customer service was really great. We ordered one appetizers and three dosas which were delicious. Garlic cheese masala dosa I would highly recommend. Mysore masala dosa was okay. Panner 65 was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.
Davie Dosa Company,5,"We went to have dinner at Davie‚Äôs dosa during our Vancouver trip and the food here is too good. This place is open 24/7. We tried Mysore masala dosa, cheese dosa. In sweet dish we had rasmalai, pista kulfi. You should try both these sweet dish. They were so flavourful. Must try."
Davie Dosa Company,1,"Looking at so many positive reviews I choose this over other restaurants. I have visited recently for breakfast. Very bad experience.
Please stop preparing Vada; it was like stone. I have never had Vada with such a hard texture in my lifetime. I felt it wasn't fresh, but fried multiple times. The Dosa was also undercooked."
Davie Dosa Company,4,"Ordered chicken curry and Rava Masala dosa. The dosa was good however the chapati with the curry could have been better. The place was managed by a very friendly gentleman. Overall experience was good, could have been better though."
A&W (467 West Broadway),4,Pleasant friendly staff. They do a great job. The washroom sink could use a wipe down  a few times per day. Thank you for washing your hands and using gloves. Good service.
A&W (467 West Broadway),4,Usually decently fast. Staff usually try. I appreciate the double buddy burger with onions and the junior chicken as well-priced fast options with decent amounts of protein. Root beer is also nice and classic :)
A&W (467 West Broadway),1,"Went here to grab some burgers for me and my son. Was served two absolutely disgusting raw chubby chicken burgers.

Got home 10min drive away, I took a bite of one and didn't notice until after I swallowed. Cut the second one in half to check and guess what? Nearly raw as well! Good thing my son didn't touch his yet!

Drove back and they cooked me new ones, and gave me free fries. That's it. The lady didn't even seem surprised about it, probably happened before maybe new staff? Either way she didn't seem very sincere when she apologized. While I was waiting for my new burgers to cook, two more customers returned with issues with their orders as well.. What a nightmare.

I was in a huge rush and already running late so I didn't have time to argue with them about it I just wanted to eat at that point. I should have demanded some free coupons or something, but I don't know if I even want to return there anymore or any a&w for that matter."
A&W (467 West Broadway),1,It's advertising as an open 24 hours business but it's not! We got kicked out at 1AM with cold food without chances to express our dissatisfaction!
A&W (467 West Broadway),1,"Worst A&W I have been to with very poor service and low quality food. Ordered 2 egg and cheese sandwich combos with coffee and hashbrown. The sandwich had a super thin egg, and cheese was half way falling out of the sandwich. The coffee was lukewarm and cold (double double). It seemed like a regular (single sugar and cream). After drinking it for a while we noticed they didnt mix it so the sugar was at the bottom of the coffee. Also the hashbrown was not cooked properly, they literally put it in the fryer and took it out while it was drenched in oil. I get this meal from other locations and it was never this bad."
Breka Bakery & Caf√© (Davie),5,"It‚Äôs a cafe that opens 24/7. I Love their hot chocolate! It is very rich in flavour , smooth and creamy. It has a well balanced sweetness and satisfying taste! There are also great variety choices of desserts and pastries as well! I would love to come again to try their products!"
Breka Bakery & Caf√© (Davie),5,"If you‚Äôre in Vancouver only for a few days, this can be your safe place to have breakfast or brunch or just coffee and dessert or all of them! We visited different locations and tasted something new each time, they were all really good and affordable. Will definitely visit again!"
Breka Bakery & Caf√© (Davie),5,"Breka Bakery is known to be a popular spot among locals and visitors alike, so it can get quite busy at times. However, the bakery has a large seating area, so even when it's crowded, you can usually find a place to sit and enjoy your food and drinks.

If you are in a hurry or don't want to wait in line, Breka Bakery also offers a convenient online ordering system where you can place your order ahead of time and pick it up at your convenience. This can save you time and ensure that you get your favorite items without having to wait in line.

Despite the crowds, the staff at Breka Bakery is efficient and friendly, so the service is usually quite fast. If you visit during peak hours, it's best to be patient and enjoy the lively atmosphere while you wait for your food and drinks."
Breka Bakery & Caf√© (Davie),5,"It may seem unassuming, but they seriously have the best individual sized cakes. Highly recommend any of the mousse cakes especially the coconut mango and Kahlua chocolate. The fact they‚Äôre open 24/7 is a huge bonus!"
Breka Bakery & Caf√© (Davie),4,"Had the flat white and pistachio donut. Flat white was lovely - perfectly milky, and while the donut could have had a stronger pistachio flavour, it was pleasantly moist.
I'm impressed by the food selection (bread, meals, and desserts) and that they're open 24/7.
I came back and tried the matcha cream puff based on other reviews but unfortunately that wasn't as great. Large portion size with plenty of cream, but the matcha flavour wasn't there in the cream, and while it was strong in the glaze, it was on the bitter/overly vegetal side. Still appreciate that it isn't very sweet though."
Dhaliwal Sweet & Restaurant,5,"Came here after hearing the good reviews about their sweets and their samosas and I can definitely say it lives up to their good reviews! I ordered online for pickup for 32 samosas and a 1lb box of veggie pakora. I received a hot tray of samosas, a huge takeout container‚Äôs worth of tamarind chutney, and a box of veggie pakoras, plus 2 little containers of mint chutney and tamarind chutney. It was nice to receive the chutney as I was not expecting to be given any at all - a lot of places charge extra for it.

I also ordered a 1lb box of assorted sweets and as someone who has never tried Indian sweets before, I was delighted to find they were delicious and full of flavour. The lady behind the counter was kind enough to give my brother and I a small of sample of a dessert before we bought it.

Taste wise, everything tastes quite good! Because we transited here, our box of pakoras got a little softened from the journey home (understandably) and it crisped up easily in the air fryer. I love how they taste. The samosas were packaged well and not a single one of them was soggy or anything. They came in a foil tray with a layer of foil on them as a cover, poked with holes to let steam out. The samosas are perfectly seasoned and spicy.

Service was prompt and quick, straight to the point. The staff were kind and gave me their suggestions about what sweets were popular.

Thanks again for the great service and great food üôèüôè"
Dhaliwal Sweet & Restaurant,5,"I order online most of the time from Dhaliwal sweets but I‚Äôve visited this place  too to make take out order for sweets. Food quality and staff service, both are good. I am vegetarian so I like all the veg dishes here. I order samosa often. I used to like handmade samosas more though. Highly recommend to try this restaurant."
Dhaliwal Sweet & Restaurant,4,"Dhaliwal is a one to go place for North Indian cuisine. From assortment of quick bites,  sweets, chai, savories, and main course......this place offers a variety to choose from. Best part is that they are open 24 hours, so satisfying a late night craving within the reach of city limits is possible."
Dhaliwal Sweet & Restaurant,5,Very good sweets and tastes just like the taste of Indian sweets. Highly recommend this restaurant for new commers.
Dhaliwal Sweet & Restaurant,5,"The food here is great, but the people answering calls never listens, I‚Äôve requested them for same change every-time but no one really cared. Last time I ordered, one of the staff members Jashan helped me out, her service is really great and she took care of my order exactly how I wanted for the first time. She‚Äôs really nice and cooperative."
Tim Hortons (195 Terminal Avenue ),5,The lady who helped me was great! She listened to my lunch order and repeated it back to me to make sure it was right. The order came quickly and everything was correct.
Tim Hortons (195 Terminal Avenue ),2,"I am very patient and dont usually give bad reviews. this is my usual spot for breakfast. messed up my order again this morning. ordered 2 hashbrowns and 2 pastries. instead got 3 hashbrowns. like you guys dont have time to check. last time i ordered, i only got 2 pastries, no hashbrown. Service is NOT good and messes up the order frequently."
Tim Hortons (195 Terminal Avenue ),1,i ordered chicken habanero bowl. when i open it at my work there is not a even single piece of chicken. it is very disappointing. i was so hungry i have to eat only rice now. and i paid for it.
Tim Hortons (195 Terminal Avenue ),4,A. Typical great! Tim Hortons location it's great that you can order both on the tablets and up at the desk. Quick service and pretty clean parking lot as well.
Tim Hortons (195 Terminal Avenue ),1,"Absolutely horrible location. Took my gf there for a quick coffee after school and the girl working saw us and walked to the back as soon as we walked in. She said she would be a minute, we waited 5 and left."
Pizzeria Farina,5,"Stumbled into the pizza place after a punk show, and I can't state enough how much of an enjoyable experience it was. The staff was exceptional, and the food was delicious. I want to stop here every time I hit up the Cobalt."
Pizzeria Farina,5,"Pizza was fantastic, the crust resembles a Napolitan style with the chew of a NY thin crust. Sauce was light, flavorful and the most important part not cooked before putting it on the pizza! We've had a lot of bad food here in Vancouver but this place blew me away best pizza I've had in a looooong time!"
Pizzeria Farina,5,"While visiting town, I was recommended to this place from two multiple people, and it did not disappoint. The pizza was simple, yet delicious! Fairly priced as well. And James was super friendly to every single customer. He struck up a conversation with me and recommended some other great things for me to do & see, and places to eat. What a stand up dude. 10/10 would recommend this place."
Pizzeria Farina,5,The Americana with its generous pepperoni and mushroom was a better than average pizza. And this compared to the other top tier pizza places in town. Had a cold slice with coffee for breakfast the next day.
Pizzeria Farina,4,"awesome thin crust pizzas, both red and white sauces are so goodüëå

they have chili and oregano oils on the table too for optional extra flavour"
JAPADOG (McArthur Glen Outlet Mall),5,"Located in the food district/street at McArthurGlen outlet, it is a medium sized restaurant serving gourmet hotdogs with a Japanese theme.

We had the following: spicy cheese terimayo, yakiniku rice, yakisoba on the side, wasabi takoyaki.

The terimayo is amazing: savory, succulent, juicy and mouthwatering. The yakiniku is very good although not everyone woukd be used to the rice in a hotdog. The yakisoba was so so but the takoyaki is excellent. It's unusual to have such good takoyaki, with a good size octopus in a fast food like this.

These are the best hotdogs I ever had in my life.

Because it is at the outlet, parking is more than adequate."
JAPADOG (McArthur Glen Outlet Mall),4,"Japadog restaurant offers a unique twist on the traditional hotdog with its Japanese-inspired flavors. Opting for the chicken karaage and sausage, I decided to forgo the bread and focus solely on the protein. While the bread looked appetizing in the promotional material, my choice allowed me to savor the true essence of the dish. The chicken karaage was perfectly seasoned and fried to a crispy perfection, bursting with delightful flavors. The sausage, too, impressed with its juicy texture and savory taste. The combination of Japanese spices and ingredients elevated the familiar hotdog experience to a whole new level. Although I missed out on the bread, my selection satisfied my cravings and left me thoroughly satisfied. Japadog is a must-visit for hotdog enthusiasts seeking an innovative twist and a taste of Japan within the bustling atmosphere of the outlet mall."
JAPADOG (McArthur Glen Outlet Mall),4,"Lots of cool hotdogs to choose from and it was a tasty lunch. The portion was not as much as expected, but it's worth it to try them. The shaked fries were the best part and are very unique, so don't just go for the plain fries. The seating space is not super clean and can get sticky at times."
JAPADOG (McArthur Glen Outlet Mall),5,Great hotdogs the ones we tried were good. I liked the chicken tempura ones that felt like fish tempura and the tartar sauce was on point. But wanted to try the wagyu menchikatsu but it was sold out. Will definitely try that the next time
JAPADOG (McArthur Glen Outlet Mall),4,"I've always enjoyed their hotdogs which has a Japanese twist: bonito flakes,  UMAMI, teriyaki sauce, Japanese mayo,  seaweed, and my favourite, wasabi mayo. Because of COVID-19, this location is cashless, which I prefer. You can only pay with credit card and debit. The hotdogs have always been a favourite of mine, and I usually crave it every so often. One thing I hope they change is to avoid using styrofoam containers for the hotdogs. Paper box would be more environmentally friendly."
Sharetea (Kingsway),5,"First time trying this place. Reasonably good experience. Tasty BBQ, fair prices. Clean and comfortable interior."
Sharetea (Kingsway),3,"The Signature Frog Fire Pot is something I enjoyed when I was in China and after the place I knew in LA closed down I was looking forward to trying out this place in Vancouver.
I called the place ahead of time for about 8 times trying to confirm the hour but it kept on going to the voice mail so I thought maybe it's too busy. It was completely empty except for one table!
The food is decent and the frog is tender and they gave you plenty of them. However they are not as flavorful. The ""soup""/sauce made many frogs too soggy.
The place is not very big as you'd guess from outside and it has its own parking lot.
The waitress is not very attentive as even though I was literally the only table there she didn't come over to refill the water until I beckoned her over."
Sharetea (Kingsway),5,"The servers were caring and friendly. Everyone that often goes to happy tree should give them a try. All the dishes we ordered were tasty, well marinated, good portion and very reasonable price! We order 6 dishes plus a pitcher of beer for two ppl and at the end we still had a portion take home. Overall, satisfied and recommended!"
Sharetea (Kingsway),5,Went there today with my friends. Really enjoyed the food and services. We spent 4 hours there. Such a great place to hangout with family and friends. Definitely recommended!
Sharetea (Kingsway),4,"The woman who was my server was incredibly kind and gave some very good recommendations.

The skewers were amazing, very flavourful reasonably sized, and tender.

The chairs were incredibly comfortable and the atmosphere was calm and a great place to talk with friends and family. üòä"
Zab Zaab Thai Cuisine,5,We ordered Cashew Chicken and Red Curry Beef from the lunch special menu. Lunch special menu items come with rice an a spring roll and are a great value for the price. We absolutely enjoyed our order. The staff were quick and attentive as well.
Zab Zaab Thai Cuisine,4,"Ok, I wouldn‚Äôt say this Thai food place is authentic but it doesn‚Äôt taste bad. The waitress was quite nice. The red curry is bit too sour and the Tom Yum soup was a bit too sour. In general you can try it out if you are around but it definitely isn‚Äôt the top tier Thai cuisine."
Zab Zaab Thai Cuisine,5,"We ate here twice now, super great experience for both food and service. Had the Massaman Chicken curry, seafood curry, Pad Thai, Papaya salad, and the best Mango Sticky Rice (pictured) in the area. Truly sublime. We will now add this place to our regular foodie rotation. Highly recommended!!! Thank you BeeBee for recommendingüëç"
Zab Zaab Thai Cuisine,5,Very very good Thai food. Reasonable prices. Great service would go again. Highly recommended if you like Thai food.
Zab Zaab Thai Cuisine,5,"Kap phun Ka! I really am happy I tried this Thai out it took me right back to Thailand üáπüá≠ Beef Penang was so creamy and  yummy fresh tender beef and veggies, spring rolls you cannot miss out on these and the Thai iced tea so yummy. Ideal amount of food I still another portion for tomorrow :)"
Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant Êñ∞ÂÆùÂÖâÁ¥†È£ü,4,"Came here for lunch on a Wednesday and it wasn't too busy.

They have a very large selection of vegetarian dimsum and other dishes as well. We got the pumpkin and bean curd in Portuguese sauce, the curry spring roll, the taro, mushroom and mock ham bean curd wrap and really enjoyed them all. Portions were large.

Service was very attentive. They checked quite frequently to make sure our teapots were full and the food also came out quickly.

Decor was modest. Pricing was reasonable.

Would definitely return again to try more dishes."
Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant Êñ∞ÂÆùÂÖâÁ¥†È£ü,4,"The most important thing to note is this is one of the best vegetarian Chinese restaurants in Vancouver. They cater to Buddhist vegetarians which means there is also no garlic or onion. The best dishes here are the pumpkin baked rice and traditional vegetarian mix. The ‚Äúfried milk‚Äù and fried taro cakes are also really good. I think everything else is just alright, so I recommend these 4 dishes the most. There is a weird smell in the restaurant but I can never pinpoint what it is, but I‚Äôve never gotten sick from eating here though. Also in the winter time the washroom is really cold (in case you cared!)."
Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant Êñ∞ÂÆùÂÖâÁ¥†È£ü,5,"Fantastic restaurant. Service was dicey at best but the owner was a nice guy. The food was fantastic and very healthy.
A good friend invited us there and pick most of the food. The next day I felt fantastic and we couldn't stop talking about how great the restaurant was. Try to curry vegetable I'm definitely order brown fried rice.
The next morning I felt energized and slept so well that night. Strongly recommend the place or the other restaurant in front of it which is also vegetarian Chinese."
Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant Êñ∞ÂÆùÂÖâÁ¥†È£ü,4,"Ë∞¢Ë∞¢ !!
An UberEats launch haul first time trying this joint and a great experience! I wolfed down a Spicy Green Beans ‰πæÁÖ∏ÂõõÂ≠£Ë±Ü which was super tasty, great flavor and seasoning throughout as well as a plentiful portion. I also snagged a portion of Steamed Vegetable Dumpling (6 pcs) Ëí∏ËèúËãó which were dope, light and fluffy as a cloud and really perfectly soft but mighty. All in all, super yummy food, albeit a tad expensive for what it is realistically.
The eco friendly compostable packaging and bag made my day, the fact their food speaks and Influences to eat right for the love of our animal friends and our beautiful planet, there ethics down to the finite details make the effort.
Support local businesses!"
Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant Êñ∞ÂÆùÂÖâÁ¥†È£ü,3,"We ordered Bo Kong chowmein and colourful tofu in lotus root. My friend liked it, I didn't do that much. It's more because I am accustomed to spicy and flavorful food. The portions were huge and we couldn't finish it. I think if you have a palate which likes texture more than flavors you'll like the food. Ambience was pretty good. Note that the noodles were much more, we clicked the picture after having first serves."
Virtuous Pie (Main St),3,"I use to order all the time when Virtuous Pie was in Toronto and since I was in Vancouver I had to visit! I usually get the ultraviolet pizza but wanted to try something different and got the Pear + Gorgonzola pizza. Smh! Big mistake. Not that it tastes bad but, I think they should put that under the dessert menu; I wasn‚Äôt expecting such a sweet pizza. The garlic knots were okay

PS: Come back to Toronto!!!!!"
Virtuous Pie (Main St),5,"Pizza here is always delicious. Very fresh ingredients, creative recipe, and reliably good taste. Kale Caesar salad one of the best. I can‚Äôt wait to come back again soon!"
Virtuous Pie (Main St),5,"This is one of my favourite restaurants, especially because no animals are harmed to make any of the food. Today I came in and I had the rigatoni Alfredo with mushrooms. I also had a refreshing glass of homemade lemonade. The lovely Irish woman at the til, Ash, went above and beyond in her customer service"
Virtuous Pie (Main St),5,"Veg. Pizza I didn't think I needed. Their superfunghi pizza and featured pizza with mushroom sausage were explosion of flavor! Open kitchen with good energy, friendly staff, clean, welcoming atmosphere.
I need some more of this very soon.
They were out of icecream, and I'm looking forward to trying their icecream sandwich as well."
Virtuous Pie (Main St),5,Still can't believe the pizza and the toppings here are vegan. :o I enjoyed this so much more than most non-vegan pizzas. The gluten-free crust that my friend ordered wasn't too bad either.
Sunflower Bubble Tea,3,"I've ordered seafoods kimchi and tofu hotpot but they gave me a bowl of noodles with pork. I really want to give them a very bad review but the girl who served me is extra nice. I just hope they'll be mindful of their costumer's order next time. I don't eat pork, just really sad."
Sunflower Bubble Tea,5,This is my all time go to place since the location is easily accessible from transit. I consider stopping by after work/school after a rough day. Good service and affordable yet yummy food.
Sunflower Bubble Tea,4,"Ordered takeout from here through door dash and on the whole really enjoyed the food. We had Braised Ground Pork in Dry Noodles, Braised Beef Noodles with Soup  Fried Rice with Chicken Nuggets, Deep Fried Fish Cake and Wonton in Chilli Sauce. I really enjoyed all the mains which were tasty and arrived piping hot. The fish cake was a bit soggy and not my favorite though still tasty and the wonton was just in a chilli oil rather than an actual sauce like I'm used to. I think it may have been my husband's first time he had Taiwanese food but he was blown away by all the flavors. I'll definitely order again from here."
Sunflower Bubble Tea,1,My bubble tea spilled all over me because of their very cheap plastic cup. I tried to poke a hole on bubble tea seal with the paper straw and it cracked and spilled everything! So disappointed! It's better to poke a hole with a knife carefully and put the straw.
Sunflower Bubble Tea,5,"bery tasty! ordered honey green milk tea with pearls and braised pork noodle. As good as expectations and is on par with the price. (medium-cost, maybe on the lower cost end given the price nowadays) also, it's not cash only anymore if anyone concerns. It accepts credit card now!"
Simply sushi bar,5,"HIDDEN GEM üíé
Really reasonably priced sushi. I haven‚Äôt seen this type of price since inflation. The sushi is also portioned nicely and tasted fresh.

The interior is small and very quiet. Seems to be run by a couple (2 staff). Cute place!"
Simply sushi bar,5,"I have been to this sushi place several times. Their rolls are fresh , delicious and have generous portion size at an affordable price. I have tried the mango sushi, california, salmon cream cheese , rainbow , bc rolls till now. The ambience and the hospitality are also amazing. I will love to come back again for trying other sushi options."
Simply sushi bar,4,"A little hidden gem in Kitsilano Very good and fresh variety.
The small restaurant, friendly service. Located on broadway west almost opposite to McDonald.
My favorate is the Oshi (pressed box) wild salmon.  Although, I was not impressed with the mango sushi, i would rate the experience 4.5 stars.
Photos of my family order on  Newyear eve.
Above all, it's still reasonably priced."
Simply sushi bar,5,Decided to try this place on a whim‚Äî and it was amazing! The sushi was very fresh and was prepared super fast. Definitely a takeout place but it was still lovely to sit there. Would definitely recommend the crispy sushi role :)
Simply sushi bar,5,Excellent Sushi and a very good price. Honestly the best deal on West Broadway. The sushi was so fresh and the the service was great. The take out is fantastic and they are on skip the dishes also so will be ordering in when I'm not at work. Excellent presentation and will come here from now on.
The First Dessert,3,"The First Dessert specializes in old school, HK style desserts. One of the few dessert spots open late in the area.

It's always busy with a lineup. Scan the QR code to put your name on the wait list. Minimum one order per customer.

- Grass jelly with taro balls ($7.75) - plenty of grass jelly, not much taro balls. Grass jelly had a slightly herbaceous note.
- Mango mango with mini mochi ($7.55) - light, refreshing, good bite from the mochi.
- Taro sago coconut milk + taro mochi ($8.45) - not sweet. Found it bland.

- Sesame paste + sesame rice dumplings ($8.95) - good filling, sesame paste was just okay. Overpriced for three sesame balls.
- Grass jelly with taro balls + mini taro balls + sago + red bean ($9.95) - grass jelly was the only thing we liked. The aga-aga jelly was tasteless. Wouldn't order again.
- Almond tea with mini taro balls and taro balls ($7.45) - almond soup had a strange chalky texture. Didn't love it.

Debit or cash only. Average desserts."
The First Dessert,1,service quality is too poor.  our group consisted of 9 adults and 2 kids and we ordered 7 servings but they didn't agree.  They asked us to order 1 serving each even if 2 of us didn't want to eat.  the food looks nice but it's not really tasty.  i had a bad experience in this store and i will never come back nor recommend to my friends or relatives.
The First Dessert,4,This was our first visit and we had good experience overall. It is a very small store with maybe around 7 small round tables each can sit 2-4 people around it. The menu is very comprehensive with a lot of choices. The menu itself doesn‚Äôt have any photo but you can scan a QR code to access online menu with photos. They encourage cash and debit card payment. They will take credit card but will add a 5% processing fee in top of it. I can understand the extra processing fee but it is a bit excessive compare to the amount of fees merchants actually have to pay to process credit cards.
The First Dessert,4,"Atmosphere was great, warm and welcoming. The interior is well decorated, with Cantonese songs being played on the small TV.

The server was nice, friendly and helpful. She served pretty fast. They served the ‚ÄúLychee Tea‚Äù when we came, the tea had a good aroma, gave us an appetite.

Food was pretty tasty, it is not too sweet, a bit bland for me, but it would suit people with a lighter appetite, my boyfriend really loved it.
The ‚ÄúBrown Sugar Ginger Tea with Lotus Seeds and Snow Fungus‚Äù was sweet enough, it had a really strong ginger taste, spicy and warm, lotus seeds were really sweet.
‚ÄúTaro Sago with Coconut Milk‚Äù was so bland, I expected it to be sweeter, although, it was kinda rich and creamy.
‚ÄúBlack Rice with Coconut Milk‚Äù was the chief delight, the sweetness was balanced excellently.

It is definitely worth a comeback."
The First Dessert,4,"I was trying to avoid traffic during rush hour and decided to try this dessert place. It was not busy when I got there just passed 6pm(and just missed their lunch specialü´†). I tried the taro sago coconut thing (04), It was pretty good! Only hoping it could be hot not ""warm"". Definitely will come back to try other items on the menu.
Note they only take cash or debt card."
Burrata Pizzeria,5,"Great thin crust pizza made with incredibly chewy dough, good cheese and sauce.

A friend got us takeout from this place and I just had to leave a review for pizza done so well üçï
The garlic dipping sauce we got with the pizza was pretty incredible as well, the pizza had a great texture and bite and amazing taste.

Easily recommended, do try this one if you are ordering or in the neighborhood."
Burrata Pizzeria,5,"Delicious, fresh, home made pizza with variety of options.

They also made vegan, vegetarian and gluten free pizza (cauliflower crust)

Highly recommended if you live nearby kerrisdale.

Keep it up Burrata Pizzeria!"
Burrata Pizzeria,2,"My recent visit left me disappointed due to the significant increase in prices. What was once an affordable and enjoyable pizza spot has lost its appeal.

The price hikes are unjustified, as they fail to deliver an improved dining experience. The pizzas, although decent, lack the exceptional flavor and freshness that I previously enjoyed. It feels like paying a premium for a mediocre product."
Burrata Pizzeria,4,"I ordered the Sicilian pizza I think? Cappicola, Spicy sausage and a few other meats on it and the garlic cheese bread. Dough was good. NY style. A bit thicker than a Napoleon style and chewier.  The toppings were not very even. One piece had a lot of sausage and one had non. Not the end of the world. The garlic cheese bread was good, but it was severely lacking garlic. I would call it more if a cheese bread. I did NOT get any garlic flavour or taste whatsoever. Was very good, but maybe just call it cheese bread.

Overall I would give them 3.5/5. Not a 4 not a 3.
Value- 5/5

I don‚Äôt know if I would order again, but I‚Äôm also very picky about my pizza! Although for $20 it‚Äôs significantly cheaper than say pizza garden.

With that being said, I think for the price I would recommend this place."
Burrata Pizzeria,5,"I ordered three pizzas for a lunch party at my house. All pizzas were well covered with toppings...unlike many other pizza places. crust was done just perfectly!
Caprese Pizza - delicious and different from usual. The Balsamic Vinegar addition was just so delectable.
BBQ Veggie - By far the best vegetarian pizza I have had so far
Non-veg - I didn't eat. But my friends loved it!
The pizzas came with dips which were not required, but we had it with garlic bread I made at home."
Sushi Bros,5,"We were pleasantly surprised by the small, rather inconspicuous restaurant. The staff was very nice, attentive and friendly. There was free tea, which was refilled as often as you wanted. But we were really blown away by the food. Despite hundreds of times sushi, it has never tasted as good as here. The tofu was also outstanding and by far the best we've ever had in terms of taste and consistency.
Sure there are many good Japanese restaurants in Vancouver, but we would still absolutely recommend this one!"
Sushi Bros,5,"We popped in to grab a quick to-go lunch and were pleasantly surprised with the sushi quality.  The sushi was great! Fair prices, quality fish. We would get takeout from here again."
Sushi Bros,3,"Sushi here is good. However, be aware when ordering delivery that the restaurant does NOT secure the takeout container.  This means that the delivery driver can easily access the contents of your food and tamper with it.

I have called them about three times over the past several months asking them to put anti-tamper tape over the box, or staple it together, yet each time they simply just tie the handles of the bag together and that's it. Pretty much every other restaurant has some kind of security tape or something over the container.

Sushi Bros... for the last time... please secure your takeout containers against tampering!

Outside of that, the food is good.  Thx."
Sushi Bros,4,"Chicken Breast Bento Box 3.5/5
Spicy Roll Combo 4.5/5
Pretty busy during lunch time, limited seating.
Not a Cali Roll fan but it tasted really good!
Teriyaki could use more love.. Gyoza too
Salad dressing was good but..
Stick with the Sushi, Bros.
& Gals. 4 Stars overall"
Sushi Bros,5,"Bro, this is good sushi dayum!
The staff are extremely friendly, approachable making great recommendations and very talented at making super yummy sushi!
An awesome feast for around 25 bucks easily filling two people for dinner, I'd recommend any of it was all delicious. All the rolls were incredibly tasty, very fresh and the miso was perfect not being too salty.
Efficient service, even on a busy Friday with a Whitecaps game on, I only had to wait ten minutes maximum.
Support local businesses!"
Neptune Chinese Kitchen-Wesbrook,3,"Some dishes are good like the wide flat fried beef rice noodles and the deep fried chicken wings were good. Other dishes are just ok. The battered fish was deep fried really well, but the corn & egg drop sauce was rather bland and tasteless. Service was not the greatest either with the service staff often gathering in groups to chat so patrons had to call out to them to get service. All-in-all, convenient location and ok food."
Neptune Chinese Kitchen-Wesbrook,2,"Mediocre food for expensive price. The portions are big though like one noodle can fill two people and its around $20. If you're getting something, get the stir-fried flat rice with beef in soy sauce special. It was pretty oily but one of the better items on the menu. The shanghai noodle was super salty and did not taste like shanghai noodles at all. There was soy sauce dripping at the bottom. The atmosphere and servers are nice but doesn't taste like authentic Chinese food."
Neptune Chinese Kitchen-Wesbrook,5,"I walk by this place all the time and it's often quite busy, got the beef & green onion HotPot with a side of rice ... excellent.
Meat was very tender and full of flavour."
Neptune Chinese Kitchen-Wesbrook,1,"Terrible experience at this restaurant. The food was awful, the service was slow, and the waitress was rude. She insisted that we had to pay a 20% tip, even though we were not satisfied with the quality of the food or the service. She said that it was mandatory and that we had no choice. She was very aggressive and disrespectful, and she made us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. This is unacceptable. I will never come back to this restaurant, and I advise everyone to avoid it. This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to. Êó©ÁÇπÂÄíÈó≠"
Neptune Chinese Kitchen-Wesbrook,4,"This location is the neighbourhood Chinese resto for Westbrook Village that we have regularly frequented since 2019. It is a good place to take small to medium-sized family and friend groups when you don‚Äôt want to make dinner, however not that well suited for large groups due to the physical layout. Service is incredibly fast, accurate and very polite. We have been here so often that the servers know us and now get our drinks and cutlery immediately after (or before) we sit down and usually before asking! üëçüèæ‚ù§Ô∏è.  The photos show our typical default dine-in dinner choices:  chicken and mushroom congee (#410 large), stir-fry flat noodles with beef in soy sauce (#914), garlic saut√©ed gai lan (#859), and salt-peppery fried tofu (#853). We have had these many times, sometimes as take out, and they are always delicious; I recommend these four dishes as go-to‚Äôs. Additionally we have had lots of other dishes including bbq pork and duck, dim sum items, wonton soups, hot pots, other noodle dishes, Yeung chow fried rice (#920, this one is really good), house special fried noodle (#901, another very good choice), other fried rices, and various dumplings, spring rolls, and some chef specials. Overall the food is very good and served up very fast. It is a very solid choice in the area although there are comparable-to-better (tastier) Chinese restaurants in the GVA. However, we will be back often as our default dinner place on days we don‚Äôt want to cook. Recommended to take visitors, family, friends. Only two points to consider (for management):  (1) Prices are higher than average, and (2) More wontons should be given in the soups (please!)."
Indian Delicacy,3,"Small place for Indian food. 3 mins walk from Marriott pinnacle downtown. Nice little buffer and a LA carte is available.
We tried out Aloo samosa and Chai. Enjoyed it. Ample seating area."
Indian Delicacy,5,"I recently dined at Indian Delicacy Restaurant, conveniently located near Pinnacle Harbourfront Vancouver. I was in the mood for some flavorful and authentic Indian cuisine, and this restaurant did not disappoint.

The menu at Indian Delicacy Restaurant offers a wide range of dishes, including vegetarian and non-vegetarian options.

Overall, I would recommend Indian Delicacy Restaurant to anyone looking for tasty and authentic Indian cuisine in Vancouver. The food is excellent, the service is friendly, and the location near the Pinnacle Harbourfront Vancouver makes it a convenient spot for visitors to the city. Thank you to the staff for a great dining experience."
Indian Delicacy,5,"I spent the day in downtown Vancouver and was happy to find this restaurant hidden away from the Main Street down a narrow path at the side is a hi rise. People please if you like Indian , please , please go here . It‚Äôs delicious.I‚Äôd travel 17 hrs all the way From Saskatchewan again to taste more of the items on their menu. We were there for lunch and needed to be in and out so had the buffet. Standard dishes as in most restaurants, but they come out on top for quality and taste .and one one more thing that no other restaurant in down town Vancouver can touch. And that was the price 20$ lunch buffet . Can you imagine that . Think about it people average parking lot in downtown Van is 16-25$ for the time you need to run around and do your business. Value for your cash is definitely there. Go enjoy you won‚Äôt be disappointed, except you picky people. You can‚Äôt be helped lol
Leonardo S. Saskatoon Sk"
Indian Delicacy,5,It is our second day here of eating out. Their food is appetizing and staff is welcoming. They were working really hard making sure their customer‚Äôs needs are met. Love how Pushpa made us feel at home!
Indian Delicacy,4,"Amazing value in the middle of downtown. It's all you can eat for $20 and they include some garlic naan, I go to taste a variety of Indian dishes.
The value was there, but quality was a little lacking. Food was a little greasy, garlic naan wasn't great, butter chicken was dry and flavour was average. The fried potatoes were good, Tandoori chicken was cooked well but also was lacking in flavour.
Everything was mild in spice, which is to be expected because everyone is taking from the same buffet tray."
Damso (Denman),4,"Went during dinner time around the weekend at 6pm and was able to get seated. I got to try their toppoki, rose toppiki and their spicy pork bulgogi.

Despite the name suggests, the spicy pork bulgogi just has the right amount of kick that enhances the taste. Given the price, the meat to rice portion is actually more compared to other Korean places that serves little rice pots like this.

The regular toppoki is standard nothing too special about it and is spicy (as usual). The rose toppoki on the other hand has the same ingredients as the regular toppoki, just added with sausages and mushrooms, but the sauce used is different. It's milder and not spicy as far as I recall. So, if you crave for toppoki but prefer creamier and milder option, then rose toppoki is recommended."
Damso (Denman),1,"The service was just not bad like other Korean restaurants. In terms of AYCE, price was also just affordable. However, ridiculously, they put too much limit on time. Customers only have an hour for AYCE. It made me and my friend hurry and had to keep checking our remaining time. I rather go other BBQ place that are not a AYCE......To be honeset, Their AYCE is poor quality and not so tasty . Dining table was seriously too small. I was placing my phone and nepkins between my legs."
Damso (Denman),5,The food was absolutely delicious and amazing and the staff we're really kind and helpful offering suggestions. Will definitely go back soonüôÇ
Damso (Denman),5,It's the best korean restaurant I've had recently. Gamjatang is the best on a cold day. But my favorite food is short ribs. Everything is delicious. Please order everything and eat it.
Damso (Denman),5,"Damso has been our goto place for hearty Korean dinner that never fails for many many years! Our all time favourites are beef soy bean paste soup, and grilled pork belly! But honestly all of their food is pretty darn solid! Their deep fried chickens are super crispy and I really liked their tacos with Korean twist! Can't wait to go back again ü§§ü§§ü§§"
Tom Sushi,4,A great spot on Davie St. for sushi! Service was quick and attentive. I really enjoyed their nigiri sushi and their special rolls. My friend got their yakiudon and said it tasted good as well. The presentation was nice and the restaurant wasn‚Äôt too busy at 1pm on a Saturday.
Tom Sushi,4,Great dining experience. There was a bit of line up but wasn‚Äôt bad considering it was Saturday noon in downtown. Their sushis are very good. The volcano roll is a must try! Also love the vegetable tempura. Service is friendly and speedy. The parking is a bit hard to find.
Tom Sushi,5,"The sushi here is delicious. Rolls are a good size and have interesting flavours. The sashimi is so fresh and melts in your mouth. Amazingly inexpensive for the quality. Additionally to the sushi, get the cheese loin Katsu and thank me later. Service is always good but definitely prepare to wait, they don't take reservations. We went on a Saturday afternoon, just past lunch time and waited 30mins - worth it for the experience. The restaurant itself is pretty small so prepare to wait longer for parties bigger than 4"
Tom Sushi,5,"A trendy sushi place downtown. It's busy during lunch rushes; you might want to call in advance if you're ordering takeout. There's a wide variety of sushi and other Japanese items on the menu, such as katsu. They even have graded quality cuts of tuna on the menu at varying price points. The items are quite unique and flavorful. The specialty rolls are quite exciting and presented beautifully. There's a good emphasis on the sauces, and the quality of the seafood is decent. I was told by my colleague that the katsu was quite decent as well. It comes as a full lunch menu set, with a one-time refillable rice and salad.
Great service; fast, friendly, and efficient. Decently priced for what you get."
Tom Sushi,5,"on Davie Street there is a small sushi place that is well lit and the aesthetic is very modern. It makes a small place not crowded and spacious somehow. You can see all the chefs or sushi Masters working together and everybody is pretty attentive, especially our waitress June. When our food arrived it was presented with a little bit of flair and the food itself was delicious, especially the Katsu. I would go again."
Dinesty Dumpling House (Burnaby),4,"Good food at decent prices! I hadn‚Äôt been here in years. We had dine in dinner. Our rating is based on 5 stars as the highest:

Food: 4/5 ‚Äì decent portions with sufficient seafood. FYI- the menu said ‚Äòprawns‚Äô which is really shrimp for 2 of the dishes we ordered. Dumplings were okay.
Ambience: 5/5
Value: 4/5
Customer service: 4/5

Go early as there can be waits. There‚Äôs metered parking is on Kingsway."
Dinesty Dumpling House (Burnaby),4,"The GREAT: steamed dumplings are tasty as expected. The darkened truffle ones are a novelty and taste ok (assume you must like truffle) . The green beans w  minced pork were delicious. The GOOD: fried rice. The BAD: service is slow to sit you even when they had available tables AND VERY NOISY. More than usual busy places. Perhaps the acoustics of the restaurant?? Bottom line: we will go again but maybe less busy part of the day/week.

Ok, we went again Sat May 27, 2023 when it opened at 5pm... Definitely less noisy and more enjoyable experience!! Food came fast and service was better. Added egg yolk/custard buns which my wife thought was pretty good - though Pink Pearl's Dim Sum restaurant is still better! Also, got small hot and sour soup which I thought was VERY tasty."
Dinesty Dumpling House (Burnaby),4,"Nice spacious restaurant for getting a huge variety of Shanghainese/Taiwanese food. The robot server was cool for the kids.

The XLBs were great. The veggies were plentiful and the beef noodle soup was also pretty good. Great family restaurant."
Dinesty Dumpling House (Burnaby),4,"It's been years (pre COVID) since we last visited the Richmond location. Came on a whim for dinner at 8pm on a Sunday. Note last call is 8:30pm! It's still a solid choice for good dumplings, noodles and other dishes. The beef roll was perfectly done and flakey. We found the rice cakes and pork chops to be a bit too saucy and needed a bit more fire to bring the flavour. We shared an ancient boil chili fish which was brimming with fish and veg. Wonderful flavour that I remembered."
Dinesty Dumpling House (Burnaby),4,"Ordered the Xiao long bao (pork soup dumplings) and a fried noodles dish. The food tasted fine as expected. But IMO the prices are high and the portion size of the noodle dish is quite small. The washroom was clean, but the bathroom practices of the CUSTOMERS were unsanitary (they don't flush the toilet and don't wash hands afterwards)."
Harambe Restaurant,3,"It was our first with Ethiopian cuisine and this restaurant ambience was the best giving a traditional touch in the way dishes were displayed.

Peanut soup tasted amazing! Platter portion had a little bit of everything for both veg and non veg. They even offered choices of curries for the non veg platter where we could choose some of the dishes we liked as we do not consume beef.

Injera was highly sour in taste and not sure if that is how it usually tastes and that was the only traditional bread available. The sour taste was not that appealing to few of us.

The portion size is very small compared to price. Over all an okay experience."
Harambe Restaurant,4,Great taste and very authentic! Honey wine is not overly sweet and home made. We had Kitfo and shared a one person's chief special. Great times! Definitely my go to place for Ethiopian food!
Harambe Restaurant,1,"My friends and I recently had the opportunity to dine at Harambe Ethiopian Restaurant, and I must say it was a disappointing experience. We had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately, we encountered a few issues that left me with a bad taste in my mouth, quite literally.

First and foremost, the injera, a traditional Ethiopian flatbread, was not up to par. It had a rather unpleasant sour taste, which took away from the overall enjoyment of the meal. One of the spinach side dishes too was sour and I stayed away from a second helping of that dish.

To make matters worse, one of my friends found a fly in their drink. Attached is the picture of it. This was not only unappetizing but also a major hygiene concern. It's unacceptable for a restaurant to serve beverages with insects in them, and it definitely affected our dining experience. Worst part, the waitress initially argued that it wasn't a fly until she saw it herself.

But the most disturbing incident occurred when our waitress dipped her finger tip into our drink to scoop something out. This was a complete breach of basic food handling practices and left us feeling extremely uncomfortable. It's essential for the staff to maintain proper hygiene standards, and this incident was a glaring violation.

Given these experiences, I regret to say that I would not consider returning to Harambe Ethiopian Restaurant. The issues we encountered were too significant to overlook, and they greatly impacted our overall impression of the place. I value cleanliness, quality, and attentive service when dining out, and unfortunately, this restaurant failed to meet these expectations.

I hope the management of Harambe Ethiopian Restaurant takes these concerns seriously and works towards improving their food quality and hygiene practices. Until then, I would advise potential diners to exercise caution when considering this establishment for a meal."
Harambe Restaurant,5,I love this restaurant! Especially the fish platter! It melts on you tongue. I also like their tea very much. And that they displqy art on the walls. I got inspired by it!
Harambe Restaurant,4,"My first time having Ethiopian food. The restaurant had good ambiance and bonus points for good lighting at the table! Service was friendly, but not attentive - took multiple asks to get water and it was slow. Food was good, I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my palette. Dumaskli Soup was my favourite - a sweet soup with a little kick to it. Chef‚Äôs Choice Combination Platter for Two People was a great way to sample different dishes, I liked this. The Ye Assa Tibs (fish) reminded me of Chinese fish dishes. The Injera is like a less mild sourdough made into a steamed tortilla with bread consistency - not my favourite but I believe it‚Äôs personal taste as my friends liked it. Our meal came to $93 after tips for 3 people."
BT Cafe Â§ßÊãáÊåáÈ§êÂª≥,4,"A hole in the wall restaurant that serves HK cafe food. Their portions were decent and at affordable prices. The dishes we had were pretty good, kind of exceeded my expectations. Very satisfying."
BT Cafe Â§ßÊãáÊåáÈ§êÂª≥,3,"I wouldn't know this place exists because it's almost a hole in the wall type of store front. Hours are quite short compared to other HK style cafes. They open at 11am but breakfast menu is only available until 11:30am, so really you only have 30 min window to order from the breakfast menu. At opening time half of the restaurant filled up already and by 11:15am all tables are filled, mostly locals from the area that knows the menu by heart. Standard pricing, food and service. It's not wowing for someone like me who's not from the area but I think it's a great option for those who live close by. I ordered the two choice with pork cutlet and basa fillet. The fish was fried to tender but the pork was thin and tough. Usually other HK style cafes was red or white soup to choose from (aka cream or Russian borscht) but they only offer one choice of soup, which was cream soup today."
BT Cafe Â§ßÊãáÊåáÈ§êÂª≥,5,"BT Cafe is a hidden gem that harks back to traditional family-owned neighbourhood cafes in 80's era in Hong Kong. This cafe has a good variety of dishes on their menu including Clubhouse Sandwich, mix & match fish soup noodles, fried noodles and fried rice, even steamed egg pudding. Service is quick and efficient. Seating is typical and a bit on the cramped side. But you are here for delicious food at a great value, not a place to socialize with friends. Pricing is low by 2022 standards, but portions are generous so they deliver great value. I will definitely be back to try other dishes including breakfast (A+B menu)."
BT Cafe Â§ßÊãáÊåáÈ§êÂª≥,5,"BT Cafe is one of the best old-school Hong Kong style cafe restaurants on Kingsway. They have been here forever. You will not believe the size of their dishes when you look at the bill. Pre-pandemic prices, yet always big portions. Food is typical Cantonese tastes from decades past and nothing fancy. Fast, inexpensive and always reliable. Best meals on a budget in Vancouver! And the staff are always friendly, too!"
BT Cafe Â§ßÊãáÊåáÈ§êÂª≥,5,"Love their stone pot . Classic HK style restaurant , fair price for very generous portions . Friendly and speedy service . Highly recommended! Plenty of free street parking nearby"
Sushi Ville,4,"First time trying out this restaurant. Took a while to pick up my order because there was only one chef making all the sushi. The sushi rice was a bit hard for my liking, otherwise everything was pretty solid."
Sushi Ville,4,"I like the layout of the restaurant and the benches for seating. Tasty rolls/good sized portions. Not great service- slow and it wasn't busy when I dined. Overall, a positive experience: I would return for more."
Sushi Ville,3,"Had the party tray and the taste was good and standard for all sushi flavours. The rolls were kinda loosely made though so the sushi came already with lots of the makis falling apart at the edges. Other than that, it was good take out sushi."
Sushi Ville,4,"Did presentation is great. The volcano rolls came with dry ice on water (i.e smoking~~), the sweet potato ebi tastes very fresh, and the seafood noodles has a delicious sweet sauce to it"
Sushi Ville,4,Perfect late night sushi fix! The miso wasn't the best the maki was good. I was sat promptly and it's table service. Terrific value
Uma Sushi,5,"Food portions were bigger than expected. The donburi were very filling

Lots of vegetable options and salads for eating healthy. The staff were so friendly and organized

I recommend"
Uma Sushi,5,"Hidden gem spot for sure! This is the place if you‚Äôre looking for something a little more high quality than your usual cheap lunch sushi place. Everything is super fresh. Slightly higher price point, but pretty worth imo. The uni nigiri is bomb"
Uma Sushi,5,"Had a lovely dinner with my sister at Uma Sushi today. She ordered the Himawari donburi with extra cured egg yolk and miso soup, while I had the Shiromi Donburi with extra miso soup.

The donburi was excellent. The fish was very fresh and tasty, you can also feel the sweetness and the texture from the slices. The portion was also great for me.

We also ordered a small plate of Tako Wasabi for appetizer. I highly recommend this dish if you're a fan of raw octopus and wasabi. Uma Sushi's Tako Wasabi was hands down the best I've had in Vancouver so far.

Overall, food was excellent, reasonable price, and the great service.

We're definitely coming back soon!"
Uma Sushi,5,"Fish was very fresh and the rice was seasoned nicely. I like it also that the pieces are not too huge that it fits in one bite, proportions between the sashimi and rice was perfect also.

Place is pretty small and very crowded on meal time, make sure you get early. They have bar seats though so if you‚Äôre alone, it‚Äôs easier to find a seat"
Uma Sushi,5,"Such a pleasure to be able to come to uma again. I come once a month, everytime i‚Äôm back. It‚Äôs so good to see this place is busy all the time, it‚Äôs really wonderful. Chef ping curates fresh fish selections weekly and come if you like exploring new things. This week I tried the cooked hamachi cheek and the tuna tataki. The aburi sushi is also amazing. I eat so much I‚Äôm stuffed everytime."
Ginger Sushi,4,"We decided to take a Sunday walk along Commercial Drive with our dog.  It was wet and rainy and we were lucky to come across a dry table outside of Ginger Sushi.  We ordered a few items.   The tea was served hot and perfect for this wet afternoon.  The tuna and salmon sashimi was fresh.  The miso soup hot.  The tempura crispy and sauce perfect.   The house roll, negitoro roll and spicy tuna were all yummy.  They had a good rice to fish ratio.  The restaurant is a nice little restaurant.  Service was good.  If you have a sushi craving don‚Äôt hesitate to try it here."
Ginger Sushi,5,"Very lovely location for fresh Japanese food! üêü
Sashimi don and sushi set were very fresh and portion size was great!

Notably, there are not too many tables (4 to be exact) and seating can be quite cramped during busy hours, but the server was very friendly and patient the entire time! Will come again!"
Ginger Sushi,5,"This place has such good chicken teriyaki, sooo yummy. Everything is super fresh. This a great sushi place on the drive."
Ginger Sushi,5,Ginger sushi is the best! Freshest sushi for tiny prices. The portions are great. I love their avocado roll and salmon rolls. The salmon portions are always out of this world!
Ginger Sushi,5,"Delicious food and excellent service

I visited this place last Saturday.
I ordered it togo, server was very friendly. She explained the ingredients well.
I really enjoyed the meal. Yum!

Gotta come back for more. Cheers"
Tacofino Kitsilano,5,Person taking my order was super friendly. He recommended the crispy chicken burrito so I went with it. It was pretty good but a little bland. They had some sauce in the burrito which I wished they used more of but overall still a tasty bite. I loved the different textures that came in the burrito. The chicken was definitely crispy and came with a big crunch. I also got tater tots. Can never go wrong with those.
Tacofino Kitsilano,5,Tasty tacos and burritos. Was very filling and the ambiance of the place was also quite nice
Tacofino Kitsilano,5,"The ingredients are really fresh here. The fried pacific cod is very crisp and not oily. It fits perfectly in the taco. The crispy chicken burrito was also very well wrapped and has different textures when you're having the dish.  üòä
The taco was great but it'd be best to get more than one or everything falls out when only one taco is in a Togo box. üòÇ"
Tacofino Kitsilano,5,"As always, Tacofino does not disappoint. This was my first time at the Kits location and the food quality is as great as I remember and there's a decent amount of seating available. Staff were very nice and quick to clean up tables to ensure they were sanitized between uses. This location is much more low key and definitely has a more relaxed environment compared to Gastown and Hastings but I think I prefer that it feels more welcoming."
Tacofino Kitsilano,3,"If it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it! Bummed their amazing soft and crunchy beef taco changed - it‚Äôs made with ground beef now instead of the steak bits that made it so epic before. The staff tells me I‚Äôm not the only disappointed customer so hopefully management will consider bringing back the previous version. Bummer that it has the same name too so I didn‚Äôt know until after ordering."
ChongQing Restaurant (Commercial Dr),4,"Their ginger beef is packed with fragrant spiced sweet and mildly spicy flavour. Delicious. Standard stir fried veggies. The rice was on the harder, drier side and not fluffy and I prefer my rice with more water content when steamed. Other than that, it was a pretty wonderful Chinese food meal."
ChongQing Restaurant (Commercial Dr),3,"The food here is quite inconsistent. For example, the chicken corn soup is refreshing but the beef in the ginger beef lunch combo I got was too well-done and got incredibly chewy (not great). I wouldn't recommend eating the larger dishes if these smaller dishes have such average quality. The staff were very welcoming, which is nice."
ChongQing Restaurant (Commercial Dr),4,"All good. Casual family restaurant. Clean and bright. Service was professional, efficient, quiet. Food was very good with the best ginger beef I have had in a very long time. Will happily return. Prices are $14 to $19 per item, which is standard these days but the portions matched the price."
ChongQing Restaurant (Commercial Dr),5,I am really impressed with the food.  It is way better than hons and Kent's kitchen.   Level of spiciness was perfect
ChongQing Restaurant (Commercial Dr),5,"Whenever I go into Vancouver this is the place to eat. The food is incredible. I have been coming for years and have not found a better Chinese restaurant. Great flavour, hot and large portions. We always like to go with a larger crowd so we can order a bigger variety. The staff are friendly and attentive. Excellent restaurant!"
Delicious Pho (Robson),4,"First time trying Pho, a traditional Vietnamese dish, and I was pleasantly surprised with the food. The Pho was delicious and cooked to perfection, with the right balance of flavors and spices. The broth was rich and flavorful, and the noodles were cooked just right.

The restaurant itself was simple but had a warm and inviting atmosphere. The decor was simple and unassuming, but it didn't take away from the overall  experience. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and they made sure that we were comfortable throughout our meal.

However, I have to mention that I'm not a huge fan of coriander, and there was a lot of it in the Pho dish. If you're like me and don't enjoy coriander, you may want to ask for a dish with less of it.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a good bowl of Pho. The food was great and the atmosphere was perfect for a casual dining experience. If you're a fan of Vietnamese cuisine, you should definitely check this place out."
Delicious Pho (Robson),5,"Big servings, tasty food, and reasonably priced. I always get beef stew if I see it in any menu and this restaurant has the best one by far. The broth is flavourful and it has so much meat in it compared to the other places who are very stingy. You get way more than you pay for in my opinion.

I recommend getting their egg noodle beef stew over the rice noodle. But both are tasty. I also recommend trying their meat skewers and vermicelli rolls. They‚Äôre not expensive and honestly just so worth it.

Their portions are huge. I always get their small size and I always end up bringing leftovers because of how big it is. Add an extra $1 and you can get the large size if you know you can finish it or are ready to bring home some leftovers.

Their staff are also friendly and efficient. Don‚Äôt expect high end service though. It‚Äôs the type of place where you go because you know you‚Äôll get good food and nice service."
Delicious Pho (Robson),4,"We came on a drizzly day, and I wanted to buy a hot bowl of soup. I order the vegetarian ph√µ as well as the vegetarian b√°nh m√¨. I have had many vegetarian ph√µ. They usually lack flavor. Not this place. It was full of flavor and an exceptionally large bowl for it being their small size. It can definitely be shared between two people. The roll is soft inside and out unlike Hawaii which is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The roll was not crispy like Hawaii but soft all around including inside. I highly recommend this place and will patronize again while I‚Äôm visiting."
Delicious Pho (Robson),5,"Highly recommend this restaurant!

Their Pho was delicious.
I got the steak & meatball pho.
It was very flavourful and the broth came out super hot. I can‚Äôt eat ‚Äúwarm pho‚Äù lol.
I also really enjoyed the Thai iced tea, it was very refreshing.

Would definitely come back if I‚Äôm ever in Vancouver again."
Delicious Pho (Robson),5,"Fast, affordable, and delicious food. Generous portions."
Bubble World (Vancouver - Robson),4,It‚Äôs not often that I come across a bubble tea shop that actually serves good food (not snacks). I ordered the beef noodle bowl extra spicy with ‚Äúchicken nuggets.‚Äù The beef noodle was quite good. I enjoyed every bite to the last. Broth was quite flavorful and comforting. The pickled veggies in there complimented the broth extremely well. So good! The chicken nuggets were tasty as well but I think I‚Äôll just stick with the noodles next time. I highly recommend this place.
Bubble World (Vancouver - Robson),4,"Great bubble teas for a hot day! You can request fresh milk or non dairy milk or make your drink into a slush. Nice chewy bubbles super yummy! Snacks were great as well we got the chicken nuggets and squid feet both were light, crispy and well seasoned. Bonus is that their prices seem lower than other bubble tea places downtown. Bit of a wait but it's to be expected on a hot day when there's a long line of people. Staff did a great job and were very friendly and efficient."
Bubble World (Vancouver - Robson),3,"It was okay.. Salt & Peppery Chicken Nuggets tasted decent but the side dishes definitely were an after thought. (I guess for an extra dollar it's nothing to complain about)
Oreo Strawberry tasted good but the pearls were tough to chew.
I still might be back.
*You need to order at the front even if you dine in*"
Bubble World (Vancouver - Robson),4,Nostalgic spot for bubble tea on Robson St! Quick service and extensive menu. I got the mango milk tea with pearls and my friend got a watermelon slush. Both were great and thirst quenching. Pearls were cooked well and bouncy.
Bubble World (Vancouver - Robson),5,"Just overall a great bubble tea place that opens until late. Honestly, the quality of the drink and pearls were top notch. I personally don't see any reasons to go to these fancier bubble tea locations that have popped up in recent years. Having gone to almost every one of them, I don't really see the point unless there's a particular drink they offer that Bubble World doesn't."
COBS bread - Commercial Drive,5,This is a late review! But I‚Äôve remembered I wanted to do this so here goes; these guys were fantastic at Christmas and indeed every time I‚Äôve gone back! They went out of their way to give us super delicious cinnamon buns that they saved for us in a last minute type of situation!! And they are generous with their icing on their cinnamon buns‚Ä¶ What else needs to be said ;) ?
COBS bread - Commercial Drive,5,"I love Cobs! Always fresh,sweet or savory,absolutely dee-lish! One of my favs is the thick cut ,white bread infused with fiber...alittle sinful but oh so scrumptious! And the staff, always so helpful and friendly."
COBS bread - Commercial Drive,1,clever one behind the counter sliced bread fresh from the oven for me and bagged the hot steamy loaf with my danishs.   It was an expensive bag of mushy bread mixed with danish.   Straight in the garbage.
COBS bread - Commercial Drive,5,"I tried the chocolate croissants, cinnamon buns, hot cross buns, bread loaves and burger buns from this bakery. They were all very fresh, packaged with care and tasted amazing! The owner and staff are super nice too. Highly recommend."
COBS bread - Commercial Drive,5,I love my COBS.  We have been buying from these folks since they opened.  I have never had a bad experience here.  Their baked goods are fresh and delicious.  Can‚Äôt live without my COBS!
Pizzeria Ludica Vancouver,4,"What a fun spot in the city! Lots of board games to choose from and great for groups. We walked in and got a table for our group no problem. They have an extensive pizza menu, perfect for sharing! Appreciate them hot out the oven. You can grab hot sauce on the side and I like to add the chilli flakes and extra Parmesan. They also have a pretty good drink menu, as well as pasta and other appetizers."
Pizzeria Ludica Vancouver,5,"Such a cool and interesting concept for a pizzeria! Pizzeria Ludica offers the opportunity to play some board games while also having some hot and delicious wood-fired pizza on the side.

We ordered the B.A.T. and Margherita pizza which were both delicious. While approaching the board games, the Game Master offered assistance with finding a board game which was super helpful!

Would definitely visit Pizzeria Ludica again!"
Pizzeria Ludica Vancouver,5,"Tried their Caverna pizza which is a vegan-friendly pizza. The mozzarella is made from cashew so the texture was more like curds. The taste is pretty good and didn‚Äôt actually taste like other bland vegan foods. Got a promo on Skip so I got the 12‚Äù pizza for only around $10 after tax. So, couldn‚Äôt complain."
Pizzeria Ludica Vancouver,5,Really delicious place for personal pizzas. They have lots of options for any dietary restrictions. Cute patio outside for great people watching too! I had the spinach and artichoke pizza.
Pizzeria Ludica Vancouver,4,"It‚Äôs a fun place for games, pizza‚Äôs we‚Äôre good too and the portions are moderate in size. The service was warm and welcoming but make sure to get a reservation ahead of time as wait lists can take hours. But our group of 5 had a fun evening with some good food and drinks."
Modern Handi Indian Cuisine,5,"The best north Indian food I‚Äôve had in Vancouver. Simple delicious. As vegetarians, the restaurant offers really good selection.
Get the badami-kulfi for drinks. It is really good. We ordered saffron keshariya paneer (yum) and bhundi masala (okra - a bit oily but tasty) and finally they also had peshwari naan (naan filles with raisins and nuts üòã).
Overall very satisfied with their flavour and quality."
Modern Handi Indian Cuisine,5,"We were craving desi food after several days of traveling and not having any Indian food available to us. We took a 25 minute uber ride just to get here. The food was absolutely delicious, Raman was a pleasure to be served by, super friendly. We ordered the Lamb kebobs, Shahi paneer, and lamb rangosh curry with butter/garlic Naan. We enjoyed the food very much and would definitely return for more."
Modern Handi Indian Cuisine,5,"One of the best restaurant in Vancouver,  they have an awesome staff waitress were so helpful & provided food at such a quick pace & were interactive as well. Presentation is ‚ù§Ô∏è as well.Stayed for 7 days visited many restaurants but this one is top notch ,if you want Indian Cuisine then don't miss it for sure."
Modern Handi Indian Cuisine,5,The food is really authentic and a little pricey.  Overall a great place to explore Indian dishes and amazing service.
Modern Handi Indian Cuisine,1,"During my recent visit to an Indian restaurant in Vancouver, we were warned by friends about the poor quality of food. Despite the warning, we decided to try the place and ordered only samosas and paneer takatak for starters to be on the safe side. However, even the samosas were just average in taste and the filling lacked any real flavor. The paneer takatak was a complete disappointment - just plain paneer topped with fried paneer and some vegetables, served with tomato ketchup as the gravy. I have never had such a terrible paneer dish before. The only saving grace was the mango lassi, which tasted good and was made with vanilla ice cream and mango pulp. However, the overall experience was very disappointing, especially considering the high prices charged by the restaurant. I would not recommend this place if you are looking for a satisfying dining experience."
Beeryani Indian Bistro and Bar,5,"Delicious, fresh and generous portion. For two people we probably ordered too much food lol. The samosas were freshly made. Chicken biryani is full of flavor. The Curry lamb again is so flavorful. Will be back to try more menu items."
Beeryani Indian Bistro and Bar,5,"Stopped by for lunch.

The best chole kulcha and dahi batata puri I have rated in North America.

Chole Kulcha- literally took me to North India

Dahi Batata puri- took me back to Mumbai. The flavors simply burst in your mouth!

All this topped up with great hospitality"
Beeryani Indian Bistro and Bar,4,"Awesome food and service. We ordered chaap tikka, gol gappe, gobi manchurian, jeera rice and chicken curry. Unfortunately couldn‚Äôt take pictures for all dishes as the food was so good. I wish they had Delhi style honey chilli potato."
Beeryani Indian Bistro and Bar,4,We tried the chicken tikka and paneer biryani .. both were good. Quality and quantity both was good. The location is good too and at walking distance from beach. Definitely give it a try.
Beeryani Indian Bistro and Bar,5,"Had an amazing experience at Beeryani yesterday evening. It was an impromptu visit with low expectations. I have to say, I was very impressed with the way they greet and treat their customers. Nikita and Ayush with their ever smiling face made us feel welcomed the moment we stepped in. Extra points for Nikita for being so polite. One of my dishes got late and she felt really bad for it. The honesty with which they serve their customers is very heart warming. And Ayush's managerial skills were bang on. He put my last dish on house as I kept waiting for it for a good amount of time. Definitely gonna be visiting them again."
Trees Organic Coffee (Burrard),5,"I personally HATE cheesecake. The taste, the texture also most cheesecakes make me so sick.

This is the first cheesecake slice I've ever finished. The Banana cheesecake is to die for. It's so amazing. Rich for sure so a nice treat but I will be back next time I'm in the area.

The inside is simple and clean and the staff are calming and friendly. Good vibes all around.

I highly recommend trying a slice if your in the mood for good quality sweetness."
Trees Organic Coffee (Burrard),4,"The classic cheesecake was good BUT it had a lemon tasteüçãüçãüçã (even though it was a classic new york one). If you don't like tasting lemon in your desserts, I would not recommend. Overall good experience."
Trees Organic Coffee (Burrard),5,"The Tiramisu cake was amazing - rich, creamy, and perfectly balanced with coffee and cocoa flavors. Highly recommend!"
Trees Organic Coffee (Burrard),5,My Chai Latte is smooth and beautiful. Thank you ü•∞ the lady was so sweet to decorate my coffee even if it was a take out orderüíï
Trees Organic Coffee (Burrard),5,I saw cheesecake and coffee on the sign and I was instantly drawn in. I hope this chain expands to other locations because I really like their product and their branding is great. This location is in a bit of a busy location and the seats were full so we took our stuff to go. The service was quick and efficient. The inside of the cafe seemed to be pretty clean. We ordered iced coffees and a slice of white chocolate raspberry cheesecake which was very tasty.
Shizenya Restaurant on Broadway,5,Sushi is delicious and the brown rice is perfectly cooked. Produce is fresh and they have great deals for happy hour. They have many options and quinoa sushi! Super healthy and tasty! Very recommended
Shizenya Restaurant on Broadway,5,"Great Japanese restaurant with several vegan options to choose from.  My first time there, and was pleasantly surprised to see I had several options to choose from, being vegan. I couldn't decide between the Tri-Colored Ramen, or Shizen Tantan Udon, but was able to combine different features of the two to my liking. It was delicious. The Spicy Agedashi Tofu and Spinach Goma-Ae were delicious vegan appetizers. I will definitely be back to try other menu items. Highly recommended!"
Shizenya Restaurant on Broadway,5,"Their vegan tan tan udon tastes amazing! We substituted udon for kale noodles, and we loved it. The rolls were great too. Will certainly be back.
Thank you!"
Shizenya Restaurant on Broadway,5,"High quality, delectable seafood dishes. Absolutely love the geisha roll and the seafood chirashi. The wasabi is really the cherry on top!"
Shizenya Restaurant on Broadway,5,It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve eaten here and the quality is still there! Got a chirashi don for takeout and was very happy with it :)) The fish was very fresh and the brown rice was surprisingly flavourful!
Baba Sweets & Restaurant - Burnaby,1,"My boyfriend ordered me a veg thali from this store and it tastes not like actual indian taste. And above all, when I opened the bag, i saw a hair thinking it‚Äôs just outside the plate but while eating the daal, there was black hair in that. I was left with no option but to throw away the whole food which we never throw at all. :("
Baba Sweets & Restaurant - Burnaby,3,"A 3.5 overall for the rating of the samosas. Great dough texture, filling and thickness but the content lacked flavour and spice. The chutney was good here - a thick consistency. Service was ok. No seating in here if you were thinking of dining indoors."
Baba Sweets & Restaurant - Burnaby,4,"We ordered from Baba Sweets for the first time per recommendations from family in the area. I was very pleasantly surprised! The food was pretty good. We ordered online and our food was ready in about 20 minutes. We walked in to pick up our dinner without any hiccups. We ordered the chili chicken, chicken curry, and rice.
1.	The chili chicken was one of the best I‚Äôve had. The chicken was very soft and tender. The peppers and onions were cooked al dente with a nice a crunch! However, the chicken was on the sweeter side. My husband didn‚Äôt like the sweetness however I didn‚Äôt mind.
2.	If you need a chicken curry dish which tastes homemade‚Ä¶ this dish, is it! Again, the chicken was soft and tender. The curry was amazing, not overly sweet or savory. The flavors of the onion, tomato, and spices were just perfect. It really tasted like comfort food. Something you could have on a cold rainy day and not feel guilty.
3.	The rice was just a typical order of rice. This was probably the first time i‚Äôve ordered rice cooked with peas from an Indian restaurant. I didn‚Äôt mind it but if you don‚Äôt like peas then don‚Äôt order the rice.
I highly recommend the two dishes we ordered from Baba Sweets, more specifically the chicken curry. I do plan on trying more items in the near future!"
Baba Sweets & Restaurant - Burnaby,4,Bought some Indian sweets today . It was too sweet for me but my husband liked it. Sweets were good enough for the price.
Baba Sweets & Restaurant - Burnaby,1,"Very poor customer service. One girl was so rude.
We asked to get the sitting table cleaned so we can dine in but the staff said we are not allowed to go out to clean. She was trying to hand over the cleaning spray and want us to clean like we work there. No thanks
Very disappointed. Could been better if we didn‚Äôt ordered food already.
Wish they improve the attitude"
7-Eleven (813 Douglas St),3,Browns is always a nice place to go for lunch. My mom enjoys their veggie burgers and I enjoy their selection of drinks. The service at Browns is always good and staff is always friendly. I decided to try their new brunch options and was a little disappointed however they are new and they might need time to perfect brunch.
7-Eleven (813 Douglas St),5,"Super yummy food! I loved the butchers block burger. Crispy and tasty, not too messy. I upgraded to yam fries. We also got the southwest bowl which was good! The desserts were ok but not the best.

The one thing is, it wasn‚Äôt busy or anything but I felt the service was very slow. Took a long time for them to come around to us. But the food is great ! The patio portion is heated and enclosed which is cool."
7-Eleven (813 Douglas St),4,"Went looking for a place to have brunch. Had immediate seating which was a bonus on a Sunday morning in Victoria. Food was good and plentiful, but the potatoes were undercooked. Server was very nice and attentive."
7-Eleven (813 Douglas St),5,"My friend and I ordered through the website, and when we came in to pick it up, a very friendly server got it for us right away. While she was fetching our order, another very friendly server greeted us and offered to seat us! Very fast, amazing food (best chicken fettuccine alfredo I've ever had), and the atmosphere we saw was very nice. They even wrote a little ""Enjoy"" note on the bag :)"
7-Eleven (813 Douglas St),4,"Met a friend for happy hour. It would have been nice to have another choice of seating. So busy and plenty of hub-bub noise close to the service area and kitchen. Social white wine, gluten free dry ribs and chips and guacamole. Yummy The server was great. The bathrooms were clean. ‚úîÔ∏è"
McDonald's (Victoria-H),5,"üíµ: probably pricier than other province üòÖ

üçú: Pancake, McGriddle, Hot Choco, Bagel with Cream cheese (my favourite)

üç±: Portion is just right

‚åõ: The wait time is quite fast, to be honest.

üë•: Service, is great. Probably, new management is very good because comparing it to the previous reviews..."
McDonald's (Victoria-H),1,"I‚Äôm not a regular at McDonald‚Äôs, today reinforced why I go elsewhere. $25 dollars for 1.5 meals was already bad enough, the food when we got home a few blocks away was literally cold! The pies tasted like they had been cooked the day before and dried on a heat rack for hours. The fries were gross and so was the burger. McDonald‚Äôs used to be a reliable place to get a cheap meal, not anymore! The Dairy Queen across the street is far better value and food."
McDonald's (Victoria-H),1,I just came from this place. I when in the drive thru and scraped my car because of how tiny their drive thru is I bumped the side of their wall maybe going 2-5 kms and now i have a hole in my front bumper. They need to take better care of their property. This is NOT OK. Not to mention the cashier saw my car after and didn‚Äôt even say anything about it.
McDonald's (Victoria-H),3,"Service varies a lot. If you select eat in, you only get a tray a little under half the time. Sometimes  they fill your drinks for you, and the food isn't the best compared to other McDonald's. But over rarely have a bad meal from them"
McDonald's (Victoria-H),3,"Large fries was a medium..
Not full.   They have their loading area beside the order speaker and I happened to pull up during onebeung unloaded.  It was so loud that it became annoying placing my order.  And moved to the first window to complete my order.  Even there the employees had to use a more loud viloive the hr should have and defended the idea that it was and idea of its location as stated that because of the cold freezer I. Rheback the tru k was unable to be turned to the off position to stop the engine.  It was just my inner Karen coming out.   Poor building design, lack of forethough!"
Capones Chicken,5,"I was greeted by a really friendly gentleman who turned out to be the manager. I asked for recommendations on what I should try and he was very knowledgeable, kind and sincere. I can‚Äôt remember his first name, but I know it starts with an N and he and his family have moved to Canada from India a few years ago.   The chicken was delicious, as were the potato wedges. Very tasty! And I will be back!  Highly recommend!"
Capones Chicken,2,"I normally do any review but it was a terrible suggestion from my friend. The chicken was so dry and I got 3 mini wings & one tight. Can‚Äôt barely remove the chickens from the wings because how dry it was. The gravy and the wedges were okay‚Ä¶.

The 8$ Prime hydration drink was the only thing I appreciated on that 30$ meal."
Capones Chicken,1,"Will never buy it again, the chicken smell bad. We bought the chicken and potato wedges."
Capones Chicken,5,"My type of crispy coating! The server is extremely friendly and helpful, she did such a great job when there‚Äôs a line up in front of her. The chicken is super crispy and tasty, the wedges has the same batter like the chicken.  Will definitely be back for more, I love the drumstick the most. The package is so cute too. Highly recommendüëå"
Capones Chicken,1,"I'm so unhappy with my order. I opened up my gravy and dunked a wedge into it. First thing I noticed was how thin and watery it was. I took a bite and I tasted...nothing! Lacked any kind of flavour, entirely. The wedge had a little spice to it, but it was really overcooked to the point that I thought I was eating deep-fried mashed potatoes. No cohesiveness at all.
Now the chicken. Again, no flavour at all. But the biggest turn-off was the incredible amount of grease that rolled down my hand and arm when I gripped a piece to pull it apart.
I can't figure out what the big deal is with this place? It's TERRIBLE food.
Sorry, Chester, no good review here  :("
Ohana Sushi,5,"Excellent quality and location! Natsumi and Jay were extremely kind and quick, they allowed us to have a comfortable and memorable time. The menu is varied and affordable, offering something for everyone. I especially recommend the BC roll. Would definitely be back!"
Ohana Sushi,4,Pok√© is ordered with a separate menu that you check off ingredients and write on with a dry erase pen. Everything was delivered fresh and hot and in reasonable portion sizes. Yummy.

Everything here is awesome! Especially their services ~all staffs always have smiles on their faces with super friendly manners!"
Ohana Sushi,3,Casual eatery and I didn't expect much. The service and sushi were fantastic! The sashimi I had was passable (was still nearly frozen and was thickly sliced). I couldn't finish the sunomono as the noodles were really hard and extremely over vinegared. I had given the feedback about my experience with the sunomono which yielded a sympathetic look from my server.
Ohana Sushi,5,"Late update..
We have eaten here so many times and never been disappointed.
Great location, friendly staff, quaint little spot in Chinatown.
We had a simple lunch on the Feb 22nd and had the Alaska roll and the Firecracker roll with an order of edamames.
Everything was fresh and on point.
The poke ordering system to customize is really easy and straightforward, but their original ones are also great!"
Dairy Queen (2205 Sooke Road),4,"Old school type fastfood restaurant in Colwood. I got coffee, and it was just average. The crowd is mostly the locals, the people living in the area. They sell ready made birthday cakes. The price seemed high compared to Walmart and Thrifty food."
Dairy Queen (2205 Sooke Road),5,"This DQ never disappoints. I was heading in for a few treats for the family and saw a huge line, but the line moved super fast and I was out of there with delicious ice cream and on my way. The staff were super friendly and professional and they were very efficient in getting everyone their orders. The best part was the survey on my receipt to get a free dilly bar on my next visit. Now I have a good excuse to go back!"
Dairy Queen (2205 Sooke Road),5,"The staff working tonight did a fantastic job! They were all super helpful and friendly. The assistant manager on tonight has got himself a very organized crew. Even when it got busy with Skip orders, they were all great! The cook even came out to make sure I knew which burger was the special order one. This is a great crew!"
Dairy Queen (2205 Sooke Road),1,"Rarely do I rate a business so poorly however this place was exceptionally bad. From service to cleanliness. Hell no! Will not be back. Ever.  I walked out without ordering my granddaughters food due to the state of the place and the rudeness of the one employee I encountered.

I have no interest in engaging with you. Look at your tapes, retrain your employees if customer satisfaction is important to you."
Dairy Queen (2205 Sooke Road),1,"So I rarely ever write reviews because I am generally not a picky person.
So it was March -26-2023 and I visited the Colwood DQ as my children and I usually frequent.
I ordered 2 small fries or regular whatever they call them.
One crispy chicken burger 2 small strawberry Sundays.
One small cookie dough and Oreo Blizzard.
My Chicken burger was raw in the middle and I mean raw.
When I took it back they said they would make another one but at that point I wasn't in the mood to eat it anymore.
There was no offer to return my money or even give me a coupon to return.
Chicken is not very safe uncooked and they need to be better.
I asked for extra stuff in my blizzard and it cost and extra $3.oo dollars.
$3.00 Dollars and hardly anything extra in my blizzard.
Anyway not to beat a dead horse but I have been going to that DQ for over 35 years and last night was my last night ever stepping foot into that establishment.
VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!"
Local Pizza - Victoria,5,Tandoori chicken pizza was insanely good! This pizza is seriously the best! Great crust not too thick not too thin. Perfect spice for flavor yet not over powering- the perfect combo! Glad I tried it - so should you!!!
Local Pizza - Victoria,5,"I highly recommend local pizza located at hillside mall for anyone looking for a great pizza experience. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is friendly and inviting, and the staff is knowledgeable and helpful.
In addition to the great food, local pizza also offers a selection of sides, drinks, and desserts. I tried the garlic bread and they were delicious, with a crispy exterior and soft interior."
Local Pizza - Victoria,4,"Second time I've eaten pizza here this week! Good price, great service and above average quality! Can't go wrong!"
Local Pizza - Victoria,5,"This LOCAL Pizza location has some of the most delicious and excellent pizzas in the warmer all the time.
I am highly astonished by the fantastic work of the entire LOCAL pizza team."
Local Pizza - Victoria,5,We always order from Local Pizza and they never disappoint us. They are delicious and the crust is to die for. The owner and staff are super nice and friendly. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone.
Snowy Village Victoria,5,First time ordering from Snowy Village. I decided on a large  mango bingsoo. It was to go and they put it in a lovely little insulated thermal bag to transport. So cute!! Arrived home and had a delicious mango treat!! Very tasty. Would definitely recommend!!
Snowy Village Victoria,5,I tried brown sugar and cheese cake bingsoo and they are good. I liked the cheese cake bingsoo better than the brown sugar bingoo because of the cheesecake cubes in it. The portions are really big. More than enough for 2 people sharing. The lady at the counter is very polite and sweet!
Snowy Village Victoria,5,"We walked over on a hot evening to try binsoo for the first time- we got takeout as the restaurant was uncomfortably hot (the little AC couldn't keep up), but that was no big deal for us.  We ordered a large mango binsoo and 3 taiyaki (honey cinnamon, with almonds in it; red bean & injeolmi; and custard).  They make each item to order so we had to wait a little while but it was so worth it!  The binsoo was light and fluffy, the mango was fresh and juicy.  The taiyaki were the highlight for us, especially the honey cinnamon.  Tasty!  And we had great service from both ladies working there. Only docked one star from atmosphere due to the heat, but everything else was great."
Snowy Village Victoria,5,"It was delicious dessert, my husband and I enjoyed it. Saw someone having watermelon bingso and he said it was really good my eyes went big. The owner was very polite and friendly to everybody. Will definitely comeback! Got take out for mom too."
Snowy Village Victoria,4,"This is one of my favorite dessert places, the mango binsoo is just awesome, I'm going to keep coming back.
That being said, it's sometimes disappointing when some menu items are not available, or when dine-in is not an option.
Other than this occasional thing, the experience is great! It's well worth waiting while the lovely proprietor prepares your desert with a smile."
Pho Tru (Blanshard St),4,"A quick and easy no frills place for lunch. Ordered from the counter, food made fast, and decent tasting and clean enough. Self serve I e water station as well."
Pho Tru (Blanshard St),4,"Great vermicelli bowl. For comparison, their crispy roll was tastier and better texture than Green Leaf Bistro's but their grilled pork meat was drier than GLB's - still tasty but a bit drier than I'm used to.

Overall great and staff has been great when picking up at lunch."
Pho Tru (Blanshard St),5,"My siblings and I were hesitant to try a pho restaurant in Canada since we know what good pho is. We are surprised by how decent the pho is here at Pho Tru. The broth is clean, flavorful, seasoned nicely, and has the aromas typical of beef pho. I felt the amount of meat was pretty small and would prefer my bean sprouts, basil, and lime on the side. Service was excellent!! Staff were very friendly and happy to answer my family's plethora of questions. This place is pretty good, and I'd definitely come back!"
Pho Tru (Blanshard St),4,"Came here by default as we were trying to find another restaurant, but these guys were closer. ü§£
We ordered steak vermicelli, spring rolls, #62 rare beef and beef ball Ph·ªü, side rice, 1 viet coffee, 1 side sat√© broth, and 3 tea. Came to $70ish.
The postives: The spring rolls are probably some of the best I've had in North America. I've eaten Viet all over. The grilled steak for the vermicelli dish my mom had was tasty and tender. I especially enjoyed the shallots and cilantro I the bowl.
The meat for the Ph·ªü was fresh and tasty. Their sat√© Ph·ªü, while it's not authentic - was full-bodied and different from the style of sat√© I've had in AB with coconut milk added.
The negatives: My broth wasn't hot enough for me. I like to scald my tongue. The sat√© broth was though. The Vietnamese coffee needed more of a stronger brew on the amount of water. It lacked the thickness you need of a strong espresso brewed viet coffee. Also, while the regular broth had a good amount of the spice blend, it lacked the beefy bone umami. Tasted a bit bland. You need the big bold bone flavor and a little bit of the fat from the marrow for a well-rounded bowl of Ph·ªü.
I'd go back for the spring rolls and vermicelli.. and maybe the sat√©.
Also, the price is a little steep for what I usually pay.
Don't come for the ambiance unless you want the ambiance of true Vietnam styles."
Pho Tru (Blanshard St),5,I devoured my beef vermicelli dish! The meal was delicious and hit the spot. The service was fantastic and he was very attentive. I will definitely be back to try more on the menu!
Rise and Grind,5,"Rise and Grind on Broad Street is easily my favourite go-to casual breakfast, brunch, and coffee destination in downtown Victoria. The food options are diverse and made to order, plus the brewed fresh Discovery Coffee is always a hit. Highly recommended, never disappointed."
Rise and Grind,5,"the sandwiches were so good! we got the strawberry banana smoothie as well, which was really good. i got the chicken BLAT, which tasted really good too. i loved the avocado in there. we were able to sit inside, but there‚Äôs also outdoor seating and the atmosphere is nice and clean. restrooms available as well :)"
Rise and Grind,1,"The girl taking my order was polite & friendly.
The food was definately sub-par. The toasted sandwich I ordered was barely warm... not crisp like toasted it should be. For $11 I expected a lot more of each filling described on the menu. If the owners spent 50 cents to make this I would be surprised. When my order was ready, I just got hollered at by a number. I had to get up twice as my drink and sandwich were ready seperately. My sandwich was wrapped in a foil bag & tossed on the counter with no word of thanks or even a smile. The staff were more interested in talking to each other than creating a friendly atmosphere. I had high hopes looking at your menu. I was willing to let the very worn floors & poor seating options slide for a good sandwich. Its just a sandwich after all.  Even Subway makes a better sandwich for less money. Have you seen a sandwich from The Red Barn? Step it up Rise and Grind! Take  look at what your competitors are doing.
I will not be back. Poor recommendation from me."
Rise and Grind,5,"Finally after 2 years living downtown I have found a coffee shop that is absolutely wonderful. They have excellent breakfast, amazing/healthy lunch options and more. The staff are nice and welcoming, and not snobby or pretentious like many of the other coffee/breakfast spots downtown Victoria. Excellent location too!! Look forward to coming to Rise and Grind (almost) every morning. Thank you for your great cafe and service!!"
Rise and Grind,5,"Wow amazing breakfast sandwich I had there. Their ingredients were super fresh and of high quality, the recipe and choice of ingredients were a perfect blend of flavor which delivered an harmonious taste experience. The portion was satisfying and the price decent.
I recommend."
The Poke Lounge,5,"Really appreciated the staff taking the time to clarify the gluten-free options for me! They were very friendly and helpful. The food itself was excellent, definitely the best poke i‚Äôve had. I‚Äôll be back."
The Poke Lounge,5,"I just love this place so much! Their pokes are amazing, I also pick build my own poke and the toppings are always fresh and delicious.
The personnel are so helpful and super nice with me.  Every time I go there, it‚Äôs a nice experience . Please do me a favour and go"
The Poke Lounge,5,"Poke Lounge is hands down the Best Poke on the Island. (And one of my top favourite restaurants in any category! ) no question. They simply have the freshest, tastiest ingredients for the best price! The atmosphere is super cleanly and a great place to bring friends. They have lots of seating and even couches for lounging on! Most importantly, the family who runs this restaurant puts love and care into everything they do. They take the time to get to know you. And they always make sure you get exactly what you want. I keep returning again and again!"
The Poke Lounge,5,"Always fresh ingredients, great portions. Friendly services from staff. Highly recommend!!"
The Poke Lounge,5,"We went near the end of the day and everything was still fresh and had great flavors. Very friendly staff that were quite helpful recommending some signature bowls. We got the Hey Hot Stuff and The Torched. My partner had one bite and said it was one of the best, if not the best, Poke she has ever had. The portions were generous and we left very satisfied. I will be coming back for more and would recommend this place to anyone in the area."
Freshii (1000 Douglas St),4,"Had the Buddha Satay bowl. Food was tasty and veggies fresh. I like that the brocolli is blanched and small bite sized florets. Love the crunchy wonton bits. Sauce is yummy, could use a little bit more but I‚Äôd rather have not enough than swimming in sauce. Staff was friendly and efficient."
Freshii (1000 Douglas St),1,Got the Buddah bowl. Rice noodles were not cooked. Super hard and crunchy. One piece of broccoli. Sort of like the Campbell's chicken noodle soup lol. I got a huge discount using Uber eats. 4 bowls for 32 with tip. Still wouldn't pay 10 dollars a bowl. I have had better salads at McDonald's.
Freshii (1000 Douglas St),2,"My salad bowl had lettuce leaves over 6"" long, yet no plastic knives were at the kiosk. Barely any sesame dressing on the salad. The staff decided it was a good time to vacuum and mop the floor around us while we were eating. The vacuum was excessively noisy, so impossible to talk over it. I asked her if they were closing, she said no, we're mopping early. It was two hours before closing. One more thing, it was very cold inside. Won't be back. Go to Tractoron Government St. instead."
Freshii (1000 Douglas St),2,Do not get the buhhah satay. This is probably one of the worst dishes i have had anywere. The sauce is bland as all hell and watered down by so much water in the noodles. Freshii you need to take this off the menu.
Freshii (1000 Douglas St),4,Convenient and deliciously healthy food centrally located downtown. Staff are excellent and the restaurant is clean and inviting. Outdoor and indoor seating. Highly recommend if you need a quick bite but don‚Äôt want to compromise on quality.
Morning People Food Truck,4,"We ordered a sausage party and two peanut butter bowls. The food was excellent and quite enjoyable! This place is a food truck so there is seating available under tents. The reason we are giving this place four stars instead of five was because they don‚Äôt really have a large variety of drink options that you would except from a place that serves breakfast/brunch/lunch options. Other than that, the food was super enjoyable and there‚Äôs a large variety."
Morning People Food Truck,5,Great little breakfast spot. Pictured here is the smashed hash; potatoes with egg & sauce. Delicious and filling. I‚Äôve eaten through pretty much everything on their menu now and it‚Äôs all superb. Excellent customer service as well.
Morning People Food Truck,5,"Having been here before, I was quite excited about taking a new friend here for a breakfast date. The food was spectacular. The staff were beyond wonderful. It was like they owned the food truck and they were proud of it. I could not fault a single thing except for seats. I find the seats constricting, but well made.
Thank you"
Morning People Food Truck,5,Delicious breakfast food from a food truck permanently stationed in Cook Street Village in a space with other food trucks.  We've had hash twice and it's AMAZING. I'd like to try the smoothie bowls. Good gluten free and vegetarian options.  Staff are friendly and funny.
Morning People Food Truck,4,"Got the ‚Äúloaded‚Äù meal. Had some really tasty hash browns, fresh avocado, micro greens and more. The thing that didn‚Äôt fit was the really acidic barbecue sauce. The combination of the barbecue sauce and the garlic a√Øoli didn‚Äôt work for me. Otherwise great meal. I got delivery so I could not rate ‚Äúatmosphere‚Äù nor ‚Äúservice‚Äù"
Little Sweety Cakes Studio,5,"I went here with friends in 2020 just a few weeks before the pandemic hit. Had the meat pie with yam fries and pie for dessert (don't remember the type, sadly. Maybe raspberry-peach?) Food tasted pretty good and was inexpensive. Ambience was that of a classic ""old-style"" diner, so I wouldn't expect anything fancy like other places.

Sadly with the pandemic I wasn't able to go back before moving away. Wouldn't mind coming back some day to try more of their baked goods."
Little Sweety Cakes Studio,5,"So many goodies here. Love the mocha cake, Scottish short bread. Most of the stuff here don‚Äôt taste too sweet like in America, which I really like."
Little Sweety Cakes Studio,5,Have been coming here since I was a child. One of my favourite places and everything is good. The Dutch apple cake is what I remember the most and it‚Äôs always a treat to be able to stop in for some goodies.
Little Sweety Cakes Studio,5,"Super service, freshly made food, casual quality eats.  Breakfast here is a pleasant start for the day in a place tucked away and well worth the find."
Little Sweety Cakes Studio,5,"After walking from Bear Mountain Resort to downtown Victoria, one is left feeling a little hungry.

I stumbled upon this gem of a spot and dropped in. I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. While the all day breakfast was appealing, I opted for the lunch special - a bacon, cheddar cheeseburger, with fries and a drink.

It hit the spot and did it‚Äôs job! The service was friendly, attentive and clearly took their Covid responsibilities to heart. Well done!"
Phonomenal Vietnamese Cafe,3,"ok ‚Ä¶ hear  me out

the service is PHENOMENAL. the waitress was so sweet.. so kind. so friendly

but the food is just not that great. i had the chicken lemongrass rice dish and it simply did not hit. i wish it did because i wanted to vibe with this place but i can‚Äôt lie"
Phonomenal Vietnamese Cafe,5,"I let them know what was the problem that I had with my order and they were very helpful and they communicated right away to make it right! they even gave us 2 free drinks, very nice people and good food too ‚ù§Ô∏è ordered from them many times already"
Phonomenal Vietnamese Cafe,5,"Delicious, favorite place to eat Pho, so tasty. Great service and price!"
Phonomenal Vietnamese Cafe,1,"New owner/management, Definitely can tell the food has gone down hill compared to other times i visited. Broth is not piping hot anymore to the point couldn't even cook the rare beef properly in soup.

Do Not Recommend & Never Coming Back!"
Phonomenal Vietnamese Cafe,5,"The service is good and the waitress is very warm. I really recommend the spicy beef noodle soup, it tastes really nice with the chilli oil."
Blue Nile African Restaurant,5,We got take out from the Blue Nile. This was my first time having East African Food and it was delicious. I can't believe I haven't had this before. Ordering on the website for pickup was easy and fast. The owner was really nice when picking up the food. Good portion sizing as I feel very full.
Blue Nile African Restaurant,3,"What the menu doesn‚Äôt tell you is that its a small serving of food wrapped in a huge towel-like piece of sour, spongy bread. So there‚Äôs lots of bread, but very little food.
The beef was super tough, but everything was flavourful.
Won‚Äôt be ordering again, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the price, but happy I tried it once."
Blue Nile African Restaurant,5,"3 of us ordered for takeout and hardly said a word while we ate. It was so damn good and unlike any else we've had in Victoria. Location was slightly out of the way, but well worth the trip. Got the meat lovers plate for myself and we shared the spinach dish. Will most definitely be eating here again."
Blue Nile African Restaurant,5,I have eaten here many time! Just wanted to try to give you a review as good as your food. The owners are so friendly and amazing. Pre covid I always felt so welcomed into their restaurant and was greeted with a smile and great service. The buffet was always amazing and super reasonably priced. Now they are just doing take out it is still amazing portions for the price! I love coming here and the food is amazing ! Great work guys and I‚Äôm glad your still open for business with all the craziness covid has caused the the restaurant business!
Blue Nile African Restaurant,3,"First time here at blue Nile, no dine-in option was a bummer. We got two combos for $40 all together and it didn‚Äôt quite live up to expectations. The meanlovers was tasty and seasoned well, quite pungent taste of Berbere but didn‚Äôt wow me. The second combo wasn‚Äôt anything special. 7/10 on the food. 8/10 on the service."
Nautical Nellies Steak & Seafood House,5,"Delicious! Took my boyfriend here for the first time and he absolutely loved it. We both got drinks which were good. We shared a calamari which was a little bit small for $20. My boyfriend has the steak and he likes it done rare and he was so happy with how it turned out. I had the fish and chips and the fish was so crispy and very good. I will add the fries are not good, they are very soggy. Will come back but I would love to see the fries change."
Nautical Nellies Steak & Seafood House,5,"An incredible restaurant and definitely priceworthy!

We had a nice place outside, in the shade and with a fresh breeze and our waiter was extraordinarily friendly and courteous.

The dishes, the burger as well as the fish, tasted delicious, were nicely plated and a good size. The self-made drinks were very tasty as well.

The experience overall was great in any case, the atmosphere was very harmonious, the dishes tasted superb and were worth their price."
Nautical Nellies Steak & Seafood House,3,"Food:
Burger is juicy and tasty.

It came with burnt, refried-tasting fries.

I am sensitive to re-used oil. The calamari wasn't only greasy but also smelled like it was cooked in re-used oil.

The service is good though.  I was attended frequently and welcomed well."
Nautical Nellies Steak & Seafood House,5,"We went to Nautical Nellies not once, but two weekends in a row for brunch. All the dishes were amazing, packed with large chunks of seafood and were really good portions, especially for sharing! My favourites are the lobster and crab salad (large enough for 2-3), the lobster and crab French toast, lobster roll, and last but not least, the brioche French toast! The French toast is so good it should be illegal, especially at only $10. As a Victoria local, I am always trying different restaurants in town and I have to say this place is one of the best. Don‚Äôt miss this place the next time you are in Victoria!"
Nautical Nellies Steak & Seafood House,5,"First time in Victoria for some time! Parked our car and started walking. Googled seafood, and found Nautical Nellie's! It was very cold out that day, and we were looking for some warm coffee and some seafood. The service was impeccable and the food was amazing! We had the lobster dip, the lobster mac and cheese, and the seafood chowder. All of it was delicious! We'll go back next time we're in Victoria for sure!"
Szechuan Restaurant,3,"1. Expectation was high: a bit disappointed
2. Should focus more on improvement of taste and types of sauce used/available.
3. Recommendation: if you are looking for Indo-chinese variety of food like chowmein etc, then probably not fit.
4. Surely the staffs are nice"
Szechuan Restaurant,5,Some of the best food I've had. Definitely the best Garlic Pork!! Delivery took a bit but worth it. I'm from out of town so it's always tough to make a choice on where to eat and this place didn't disappoint
Szechuan Restaurant,5,"Went late lunch, and it was terrific.  They were able to serve food that doesn't have MSG in it."
Szechuan Restaurant,5,Food was delicious! Had lunch meal and milk tea. Price is not expensive too! The rice served with the meal was good for 2 pax. Sulit sarap!
Szechuan Restaurant,5,"The portions are good here. Delicious, friendly, clean üëçüèª We will visit again! Thank you‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Golden City Restaurant,5,"We saw some of the negative reviews but still decided to give it a try.
It was COMPLETELY WORTH IT.

We got there at the tail end of their dinner rush- but they still saw to us very quickly.
The staff was polite and willing to answer any questions we had.
We ordered the combo 'dinner for three' for the two of us to share so we could have leftovers.
The dishes didn't all come out together, but it was all so delicious that we didn't mind. The food was hot, and clearly their chef/s are very good at what they do.

Including tip it came out to just above 60$. And for what is labeled as a 'dinner for three' that is well worth the price. We are already looking forward to lunch tomorrow!"
Golden City Restaurant,5,We ordered take out at a very busy time (6pm on Saturday) but our order was ready on time and it came in nice containers that don't leak!üòÅ You know how sometimes you get home and gravy or whatever has leaked out? Nope ! Not with this order!! Food was yummy! Would order from here again.üòÉ
Golden City Restaurant,5,We enjoyed our dim sum! They were tasty and soo good! We'll definitely coming back when we visit Victoria again.
Golden City Restaurant,5,"THE BEST DIM SUM IN VICTORIA

I love their sui mai - it's #1 in Canada
And peanut pork dumpling, rice rolls, har gow, oh, the daikon cakes as well! üíØ
Honestly everything was above and beyond the expectation.
Please keep this good business ongoing üòã"
Golden City Restaurant,5,"Busy day here as it's the Chinese New Year. glad we made reservations. We had all vegetarian dishes minus one they put shredded scallops on so we just didn't eat it, but we didn't complain about it was too busy to bother. This place looks dated so the outside does not reflect the insideüòâ"
Bird Liquor Store,5,"Can't say enough good things about the bird pub and the staff especially Dana the amazing bartender, if you're looking for a great evening and a relaxed old school pub this is the place to go."
Bird Liquor Store,5,"I love my time at the Bird. Dana and Nicole always give us the best service. They're very personable and willing to go the extra mile to make our experience unforgettable.

Their salmon jerky is one I won't forget. I'd highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a hole in the wall with some of the most wholesome people I know.

Thank you Diego and staff."
Bird Liquor Store,5,It has well priced beer. The place is nice and cozy. And we had a friendly bar tender.
Bird Liquor Store,5,"Nice and new pub,friendly staff. Place is small and cozy with 2 dartboards and good sound system. Rustic reclaimed pallet wood paneling and corrugated metal accents."
Bird Liquor Store,4,"Since they've swapped with the liquor store upstairs, the new Diggs downstairs are really cozy. Clean and friendly, and the staff are awesome"
Curry Club,1,"Food is aweful and terrible. We treated so badly by old lady. Buffet here looks so old and looks cheap in dishes, does not look fresh at all. We ordered chicken tikka and naan and chicken tikka doesnt look or taste like chicken tikka. Its  with just full of onion, chicken breast, cream and turmeric. Please dont waste your money here."
Curry Club,1,Definitely do not get their Tiffin Service. It‚Äôs more expensive than others. Plus they tend to cheap out on everything. They water everything down making it almost inedible. The amount of oil in the food is ridiculous enough to give you a heart attack. I usually don‚Äôt tend to leave a bad review but it‚Äôs been like this every single day.
Curry Club,5,I think this has one of the tastiest Food including Chicken curry but the best is Dal makhani and Kadhai chicken and they have more Indian sweets too !
Curry Club,5,"The buffet is awesome! The staff are also so friendly. Both my friend and I go to eat east Indian food regularly & today was the best. The Curry Club is the best ever! My curry in a hurry buddy and I will definitely be coming back. We hit up all the places here in town often.
I'm so thankful this place is in Victoria!!
So awesome, ppl should go check it out."
Curry Club,5,Went to try the lunch buffet today and there was a good variety. The food was delicious and fresh.
NAMASTE INDIAN CUISINE,2,"Chose this restaurant as an Uber eats recommendation. I enjoy takeout Indian food wherever I go. Tried a variety of items and nothing was extraordinary. The namaste special kebab platter was probably the most decent tasting items with the green chutney actually being the most flavorful thing in the whole order. The butter naans were nice in texture but were completely flavorless, the papadum was burnt, the ras malai was standard, but the main Murgh Makhanwala (butter chicken) tasted like a simple tomato soup with chicken pieces added, there were absolutely no Indian flavours/seasonings detectable in the dish, which I found very odd."
NAMASTE INDIAN CUISINE,5,"Amazing food, Good taste , provided taste as ordered. Mr Divakar is so humble and have customer skills. Must try if you like Punabi food"
NAMASTE INDIAN CUISINE,1,"Butter chicken is actually tomato soup, and extra hot is super, incredibly mild. The garlic naan did not taste of garlic. Apparently the samosas are good but I cannot recommend it."
NAMASTE INDIAN CUISINE,5,"Couldn't ask for better food. Simply fantastic, and in my opinion that's the most important aspect of a restaurant. That said, the spice levels seem toned down for a western palette. You can probably order something at a spicier level here than you would usually.

The service was prompt and polite. For me I found it maybe even too prompt and frequent of check-ins for a quiet afternoon, but well-intentioned and friendly.

The atmosphere was nice and grounded. I love a private booth, and this place is set up with a bunch of them. The music was relaxing. Nothing felt put on or over the top, it's just an nice place to enjoy a delicious meal."
NAMASTE INDIAN CUISINE,1,"Not a great place !
I discussed with the owner, he suggested the malai kofta is their best dish and so we tried. he categorically did not include Paneer dishes.
The malai kofta was only Potato, and gravy was also not very tasty, the whole experience was tardy. We had orders for togo in evening around 3PM in July. Restaurant was not busy , so any dish could be given with proper attention.
its sad to see, there are folks fooling around for Indian dishes !
Certainly I will never go to this restaurant again.

Thanks"
Pagliacci‚Äôs,5,"When they say they‚Äôll find you a spot and the lineup will be fast they mean it! It‚Äôs so busy and booming with life in this restaurant and makes for great atmosphere. The food was delicious, we got the Minnesota Fats to start, followed by The Prawn Broker and The Big Easy for our main. We also had sangrias on tap, and a glass of wine each. The service was great considering how busy it is, there‚Äôs always someone making sure every table has what they need and asked for in a timely manner. I highly recommend eating here if you‚Äôre in Victoria, all around great experience."
Pagliacci‚Äôs,4,"The place was buzzing with people when we got here. It is a very popular pasta Italian Restaurant.   No pizza.

We enjoyed most of the dishes as we were a large group.   Loved the meatballs.

I had the seafood pasta which was great.

The wine selection was good and priced fair.

Service was good considering the place was not very organized."
Pagliacci‚Äôs,5,"We were visiting Victoria for the weekend and this restaurant was recommended to us by one of the employees at a local bike rental place.  We were not disappointed! Each dish had two size options which was great because we were flying home that day and couldn't take left overs. The seafood pasta tasted fresh, and the coconut curry cream sauce had so much flavor!"
Pagliacci‚Äôs,5,"Late night surprise!
Just in Victoria for one night and running late we rushed to find somewhere to eat. This place was amazing. Our server Zac was terrific and the food delicious!
We ordered the Minnesota Fats to start, Bicycle Thief Pasta and I‚Äôll have what she‚Äôs having (seafood platter). It was too much food for 2 of us but we had a selection of it all!"
Pagliacci‚Äôs,5,"Just amazing  ! It was a line outside but was fast. The staff really friendly, make it me feel really comfortable. I ordered the rissoto balls and the prawns pasta, so delicious! And the focaccia, the best I had eat in my life! For drink I ordered Aperol spritz and sangria, both really good.
Live jazz music and fast service. I would like to come back :)"
Varsha Indian Kitchen,4,"3 stars for food as I didn‚Äôt quite like the dal tadka, coconut rice and Kale potato curry. Samosas were good as expected. Naan is soft and well cooked. Service is great. Spacious place too."
Varsha Indian Kitchen,5,"Visited the place few days back with my friends. I must say this is simply amazing... right from the staff to the taste of food and drinks. Biryani, chicken, kofta.... all were mouth watering delicious.
Surely coming back."
Varsha Indian Kitchen,5,excellent and tasty food. we tried biryani and chicken wings..Arshad was a great host and a friendly personality. We thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience here..
Varsha Indian Kitchen,5,"I can not attest to how authentic the food is as I am not indian, but it was pretty yummy to me. The braised lamb curry was super tender and I don't eat super spicy, they were very accomadating with making the curry mild for me and it tasted just right. Although I've had better naan bread elsewehre, the ones here were not bad. The resturant is very spacious and the service was decent, I would not mind coming back here again."
Varsha Indian Kitchen,4,We had checked in this afternoon for lunch in Varsha Indian kitchen Victoria island the food was amazing but felt if they had added more meat pieces that would be great but the taste was fantastic and the waitress over was nice and suggested the items to try she is a professional.. if anyone wants to have mild flavours I would recommend to go with spicy then the taste would be apt as mild that was my thought overall great food and had an amazing time and nice ambiance..ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ I would recommend this as to go place in Victoria BCüòâüòâüòâ
Noodle Box (Uptown Blvd),1,"Really wanted to like this place, as the noodles have interesting flavours.  The service was ok, time it took for the food was fine, but when I tasted the Singapore Cashew Curry Box it was bland and had zero salt in it, I'll appreciative of the fact that it isn't too salty, but to have no salt is not acceptable.  This can be easily resolved by adding salt, but they don't have shakers at the tables.  On the flip side, The Drunken Noodle Box was way too salty!  Now that was harder to rectify cuz you can't remove salt, ended up not finishing it.  Regardless, I think they need to work on quality assurance here.  Was not pleased, but will give it another try some day, as it has promise.
The tables were really dirty and nobody was cleaning them up the whole time we were there."
Noodle Box (Uptown Blvd),1,"One star for taste, staffing, time, cleanliness, hygiene, and presentation. We had to wait for 40 mins to get our food delivered and also they didn‚Äôt even pay what we needed. Awful experience this time.

Langford was way better than this

Had a bad experience."
Noodle Box (Uptown Blvd),5,"Have been eating here regularly for a few years. Usually really tasty, but when Yash cooks your meal, WOW! He is passionate about his cooking and you can tell when you take your first bite. He makes the best Crispy Shanghai Chicken Box, and it‚Äôs always exactly the same!"
Noodle Box (Uptown Blvd),2,"Not worth it, simply disappointing.
I want to say this first: Do not take payment for an order and THEN tell your customer that there is an extended wait for their food (20 minutes). They now feel obligated to say it's fine. I popped in on a 30 minute lunch break, and had I know about the wait, I would have chosen to go elsewhere.
What I don't understand is how you can have a 20 minute wait when you only have 1-2 other customers in the entire restaurant. If this is a staff issue, it needs to be addressed ASAP.
What boggles my mind even further is that even after the wait, the chicken in my butter chicken bowl was STILL COLD. The sauce was hot, the bowl was warm, the naan was hot. So what happened to the chicken??
The icing on this terrible cake is that I paid +$15 for what is effectively a bowl of rice, sauce, cold chicken, and a few small pieces of naan.
I am giving 2 stars the sauce was spiced well, and the serving size was decent.

In summary, unless this place undergoes msjor changes, do not bother visiting."
Noodle Box (Uptown Blvd),4,Not preparing food with a hairnet or beard net is crazy but the food was great. 5 stars other than the hairnet issue
Il Greco Restaurant,5,"Had dinner there, waiter recommended the lamb and it was absolutely delicious!! Just the perfect tenderness, flavour was on point, sides were perfect. Will 100% be back!!"
Il Greco Restaurant,2,"Very confused over the glowing reviews.

First, at the back there was a lineup of people so I went around front and entered. Staff looked at me and ignored me. A seated customer told me I needed to go to the back. I did so and was told I needed to go wait outside despite having a reservation.

Once seated service was slow even to get drinks. I tried the bbq ribs and frankly I wish I had gone to montanas(which I never do) because they would have been better and cheaper. For the price it was a small amount of ribs that weren‚Äôt great, served with over steamed, not seasoned vegetables along side rice, potato and pita. As my dining companion put it ‚Äúmediocre‚Äù. For the price there are dozens of better restaurants in Victoria.

When we were done it took forever to get our bill. And once we did it took 3 or 4 tries for the waiter to get it right. And again, I‚Äôve had way way better meals in Victoria for less. You can get better entrees at Il Terazzo for less."
Il Greco Restaurant,5,"New location, just down steps, from former spot. I mean, is there any other better Greek food in the City?! I absolutely love either the, chicken n Ribs/extra potatoes and or the surf and turf. Da_Mrs.. usually likes the traditional Greek dinner. While the kids always.. either pizza or hamburgers.. El Greco!! Always good happy food and vibes!!‚ú°Ô∏èüåàüíØ‚ù§Ô∏èüá¨üá∑"
Il Greco Restaurant,5,"Great lunch and pizza- the taste is authentic- but the timeless flavor of Il Greco is it's very versatile and expansive menu. We tried Baked Penne pasta (it comes with a hefty helping size) Greek salad half bowl, and Pizza 2 ways.
The portions are sizeable and you must be hungry.. We shared some plates."
Il Greco Restaurant,5,"So well seasoned.  We ordered the Greek Platter for the 2 of us, took home 3 take-out boxes after getting all fed up. Amazing!  The patio at the new location is nice."
New York Fries (Mayfair Shopping Centre),5,"Absolutely gem of a place! This review is seriously overdue as I have been traveling a lot, but I am glad I am able to write it now as this location fully deserves all the appreciation. I am huge poutine fan and no where else in Canada I believe one could or would find such a variety of poutines' like New York Fries serves, especially this location, their fries have been perfectly and freshly cooked everytime I've ordered and I have never been disappointed with my meal, infact once there was a long line up during a long break season and I observed with my own two eyes one of employees disposing the previously cooked cold fries and preparing a fresh batch when they could easily cut-corners at that busy time and earned the same amount of money in sales, but clearly the employee and the franchisee of this location holds ethical standards to high. Extremely delighted to see such excellent service where I am actually getting my money's worth with a smile! Thank you New York Fries! I'll surely be making a pit stop again and again as soon as I am back home from aboard! Delicious üòãüçüüå≠"
New York Fries (Mayfair Shopping Centre),1,"A staff served me an my sister today he was a man who was working at 7:57pm he didnt even tried to give us serveittes forget about the tray ,we went back to him and told him he served us wrongly just for him to give us the tissue afterwards . We felt so wronged"
New York Fries (Mayfair Shopping Centre),1,"Completely disappointed in this order  of ‚Äúloaded chilli cheese dog‚Äù - there was hardly a trace of ground meat in the watery ‚Äúchilli‚Äù, the dog was ok, but the cheese was a salty cheese product, not real cheese. The dogs fell apart as we tried to eat them because the soft buns did not have enough strength to hold in the saucy  assembly, and we had to go get forks and knives to cut it all up and eat them in the paper baskets. What a horrible mess and a let-down! Should be advertised as a mediocre at best version of a great idea. Our orders were much less than mediocre in taste, presentation, texture and overall experience."
New York Fries (Mayfair Shopping Centre),5,"Visited New York Fries Store at Mayfair Mall on this Tuesday and
ordered a combo for 2 with large poutine. The food(poutine and
hot dog) was absolutely amazing. The poutine was really good and huge sizing. Perfect for dinner with my spouse. Would love to go back to this restaurant again."
New York Fries (Mayfair Shopping Centre),1,"The last few times I've had their fries, the fries are burned or over cooked.  Stop over cooking the fries please."
Little Caesars (Hillside Avenue),2,"So I paid more than 20 dollars for a deep dish pizza. I felt like the pizza wasn't a deep dish pizza at all. It was more like a pizza with extra thick dough and very minimal toppings and cheese. Very disappointed with the overall quality of my order. I haven't tried anything else on the menu so I don't know if other menu items are good or not. But don't get the deep dish pizza! It sucks!
Bread sticks were ok, only reason for the 2 stars."
Little Caesars (Hillside Avenue),1,"I really really like the Pretzel pizza, but despite that I won't go here anymore because the management is absolutely horrendous. 3 / 6 times I've ordered here they've got my order wrong, and it's not like it's a complicated one. Just a Cheese Pretzel Pizza, it's all over their branding. The most recent time I got home before I realized it wasn't right, and when I called in, they told me that there's ""no need"" for a refund because they were busy? Like, mistakes happen, but that's my money that you took, and didn't deliver the product. Unacceptable. I won't be coming back."
Little Caesars (Hillside Avenue),1,Used to be good but has really gone downhill. I ordered the pretzel pizza and stuffed crazy bread and was extremely disappointed. There was barely any cheese in both items and there was no sauce on the pizza. Do not order from the hillside store. For the price you pay it‚Äôs not worth it. The last few times I order is has only gotten progressively worse.
Little Caesars (Hillside Avenue),5,"They cooked up a hot-n-ready recipe for me outside the hours they normally offer it. Speedy service, smiles, great pizza."
Little Caesars (Hillside Avenue),4,I order here often for my kids as it's cheap and they love it. Can't beat it for the price it's pretty good.. Got a pizza tonight and I think the person cutting it had a seizure.....
Famoso Neapolitan Pizzeria (Market Square),5,Loved it! The atmosphere is really laid back and lots of natural light. Super good for families. I went solo and had a pizza. The pizza is traditional and stayed warm to hot for a good period of time. Which was amazing! Two tvs if u like sports like me. Will be back and recommend it . Nicely located
Famoso Neapolitan Pizzeria (Market Square),5,"My mom and I had a wonderful lunch while shopping downtown. I ordered the prosciutto arugula pizza not realizing the prosciutto is not cooked into the pizza. I asked the staff if it was possible to place it back in the oven to crisp the prosciutto, apologizing for my mistake. The manager kindly offered to make a new pizza with the prosciutto cooked on top for no extra charge. They were extremely kind, generous and the pizza was incredible. My mom ordered the tomato bisque with her pizza and raved for most of the day about how good it was. We had a wonderful lunch and very much appreciated the effort to go above and beyond. I would definitely recommend Famoso and will be back again."
Famoso Neapolitan Pizzeria (Market Square),3,"This place used to be lovely and worth it‚Ä¶

Unfortunately these day you spend almost $80 for 2 pizzas and the service isn‚Äôt the best‚Ä¶ most of the servers seems to be 16 and not caring about customers.

The pizza taste is good but not worth the money to be honest.

We are pretty disappointed because it used to be our go place‚Ä¶ too bad"
Famoso Neapolitan Pizzeria (Market Square),1,"We went there on 19th April yesterday in the afternoon. The girl over there was pretty rude. Was it because of racism. I totally felt so. As i was carrying a pet, I asked for takeaway because she didn‚Äôt entertained my one foot inside. She didn‚Äôt even let me have a glass of water while I was waiting for my order to get ready. Even while handing over pizza to me she didn‚Äôt gave any napkins, seasoning etc. i wonder they must be delivering orders to places so they know how to do that right."
Famoso Neapolitan Pizzeria (Market Square),2,"I got the 7"" arugula prosciutto pizza... It was burnt and had almost no taste. Side salad was good though. Worth $22? Probably not."
Fork'n Pork,3,"The mac and cheese was delicious and well priced! I got bacon add on and my girlfriend got the pulled pork. Both were delicious and would recommend! Great flavour and texture and actually quite filling!

The garlic cheese bread was quite a disappointment, don't get it. You pay $6 for 2 slices of garlic bread and they skim on the cheese... Better off saving the extra $2 and go without the cheese. A bit of a disappoibtnent considering they specialize in food with cheese.

It's nice that they are open late and the wait for the food wasn't too long!"
Fork'n Pork,5,"Food was soooo good! I ordered the mac with pulled pork and buffalo hot sauce. Best mac n cheese I‚Äôve had, plus they wrote me a very nice note since I had a bad day. Delicious food and lovely service, will definitely come back! :)"
Fork'n Pork,5,"Tried the Fork'n Pork last night, found the prices to be fair for downtown, enjoyed the sandwich as well. Was also nice to see that the meals come in environmentally friendly packaging for ease of disposal. Would order there again."
Fork'n Pork,3,"Meh,

I guess with a name like fork and pork, one should keep expectations low.

I was thrilled with the price of my delivery order, but dismayed upon opening the bag and pulling the meals out.

Very small order size portions.  Much better suited for a quick light lunch, but I just finished my pulled pork sandwich and am still hungry."
Fork'n Pork,1,Ordered $60 worth of food with a great tip and watched 9 orders after us filled while we waited. Terrible service and less than mediocre food. 90% of it went in the trash when we got home‚Ä¶ didnt have a chance to litter but got accused of it in their response.  Customer shaming and terrible food‚Ä¶. Experience has gotten even worse since posting an honest review.. which they tried to tell me not to do.
Ono Pok√©,5,"Very large portions for the price! I couldn‚Äôt even finish the small size. I got a rice bowl and my boyfriend for a salad bowl. There‚Äôs a wide variety of toppings/ingredients (you can choose up to 5), they were all nice and fresh. There were a few special add ons that were quite pricey though (ex: avocado or marinated egg for $2). Interior of the restaurant seems new and is well lit and clean. You can get your food very quickly and there are lots of different grab n go drinks! Would recommend stopping by to try this place at least once if you‚Äôre in the area as a tourist like us haha"
Ono Pok√©,5,"Such an amazing experience every time! I have lots of food allergies and eating out is so difficult. Here, the staff are always so kind and help adapt meal options for me! Special shout-out to Jon and Tyler for their patience and adaptability. You‚Äôll see me again soon!"
Ono Pok√©,5,"Eating at Ono Poke will change you. I'm warning you, if you haven't had their cuisine yet you should ask yourself, ""Do I want to be a different and better person? Can I handle all this responsibility?"" It's no joke, folks. Ono Poke will ruin you for other restaurants. You'll never look at your old favorites the same. Fast food? Forget it. Traditional restaurants? No way! It's like that guy in the helmet said... This Is The Way. The Ono Poke Way.

Do you dare confront such amazing awesomeness? Why aren't you ordering Ono Poke right now? Get it together!

Ono Poke foreverrrrrrrrrr!"
Ono Pok√©,5,First time at Ono Poke and it was great. The staff was very helpful. I got the Hawaiian bowl. I have dietary restrictions and the staff let me know what I could eat as my sides and additions. I really appreciated their knowledge. The ahi tuna was so fresh! I had a great meal and I will be back for more!
Ono Pok√©,5,"Great service, clean restaurant and delicious food! Probably one of the best poke bowls I‚Äôve had in a long time. I had the ono ahi tuna and the limo limo salmon medium dish and we also had the spicy salmon snack bowl. The salmon is actually very spicy! More spicy than regular, so keep that in mind!!

So fresh, and such a great selection of fish. I will be coming back!!! Also they have loyalty cards"
The Tikka Bar,4,"One of my go-to dishes at Tikka Bar is their Buttered Chicken. I must say, their Buttered Chicken tastes great. However, as a customer who enjoys the dish so much, I find slightly disappointing is the portion size of their Buttered Chicken ( 3-4 small bite size pieces)."
The Tikka Bar,2,"I‚Äôm happy with their food. But just to let everyone going there. Phone ahead to the store to check if it‚Äôs open or not. If they don‚Äôt pick up the phone it‚Äôs closed even if it says store is open. I drove to restaurant at 1:45am seeing it‚Äôs open till 3am. When I reached there, it‚Äôs closed. My time, car fuel & energy is wasted. Putting this review so that this inconvenience wouldn‚Äôt happen to anyone else."
The Tikka Bar,2,"I ordered Spring roll for 7 Dollars
It was like nothing in the box. Too small spring rolls not even worthy for 7 dollar expensive plus very less food.
Taste was normal
Good luck to upgrade the thing taste is good but price is not good"
The Tikka Bar,5,Had the Lamb vindaloo - the lamb was extremely tender and a very generous portion. Very friendly service!  They also have a number of ‚Äúrolls‚Äù on the menu for $7.99 which I want to check out. Butter chicken in a naan bread!  Delicious!
The Tikka Bar,4,"Delicious,the spices in the dishes we had were aromatic and I would highly recommend the turmeric chicken tikka and the lamb jalfrezi.
I only gave 4 stars because the naan was clearly an after thought.  It really seemed like it was something bought at a local grocery store and not freshly made which was disappointing because the rest of the meal was amazing."
Montana's (Victoria),5,"Great food and two girls Alex and Tasha barmaids work like Bees! Everything is just great! I have already become a regular customer, although my English is lame on both legs. Many thanks also to the waiters who speak Spanish!"
Montana's (Victoria),5,"After a very long day, feeling exhausted and hangry we were met by our fantastic happy and enthusiastic server Alex who ensured we got exactly what we wanted to eat and completely lifted our spirits. She was very fast and had excellent customer service. The food was fantastic 10/10 would recommend!"
Montana's (Victoria),5,"Great place to dine!!  Tacos are awesome!!!  Stakes are perfect!
And our regular sever is the best!!
Thank You Kathy!!!  She is always full of smiles and great help!!!"
Montana's (Victoria),4,"We also went for all you can eat ribs. We arrived at about 7:30. The server was very nice. There were more people than usual, however the food came pretty fast ‚Äîabout ten minutes. Refill ribs took ten minutes as well. The ribs tasted normal, not too dry, a little burnt at the edges. Overall the dinner was pretty worth it.üëç"
Montana's (Victoria),5,A perfect experience for family day! Amazing server and kind and knowledgeable and the kitchen did a fantastic job with our food! Not that busy at this afternoon so the service was excellent! Thank you so much
Island Poke,5,"Best Pok√© I‚Äôve had. And I‚Äôve had a lot‚Ä¶

I got the Island Bowl and was seriously impressed‚Ä¶ the fish just tastes so fresh and has an irresistible marinade coating. All the ingredients were bursting with flavor and worked together so well‚Ä¶ was a bit steep at $15-20 per bowl but ended up being so good that I‚Äôd go again.

Definitely recommend trying this place!"
Island Poke,5,Delicious poke with crunchy and umami toppings. Requested the tangerines on the side and the service kindly put the portion into small containers.
Island Poke,5,"‚ÄúWhen life gives you lemons‚Ä¶ squeeze them, add salt, garlic, oils, honey, and create a marinade for cubed fish‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.this is what I imagine the owners think at Island Poke.

Very fresh and bright ingredients. I had the Ohana bowl for lunch. A great size and prepared by friendly staff. I will be back. Yum."
Island Poke,5,"I can't say enough about how great this gem is. I go almost every day because the food is so good and affordable with hearty portions and delicious recipes. The staff are friendly, they remember your name, and always go the extra mile."
Island Poke,5,"The food was exceptionally fresh and excellent tasting. I ordered a bowl ü•£.
All kinds of choices for your bowl. You can pretty much have it made the way you want it. The service was great we got to watch our food be made right in front of us. Stayed at the restaurant to eat, and this little place was cozy.
I'm not much for raw sushi type foods. I'll tell you one thing,, I was impressed and probably will go back."
Momi Noodle House,4,"had dinner along twice here in April, wasn't busy at all. Their #1 Gui Lin Rice Noodle combo was delicious & very satisfying, better than the Dan Dan Combo in my opinion. Will definitely come again with family.  The interiors is well decorated,  and some seating area were scarified for deco items, respect that.  Room to improve: was struggling with the delicate straw and milk tea drink cup a bit, :)"
Momi Noodle House,5,"Went here for hot pot with pork knuckles once and it was delicious but forgot to bring my phone to do a proper review. Revisiting today for their pork belly rice noodles plus pork knuckles. Delicious and filling.

The server was very prompt. Definitely recommended for a decent meal to enjoy."
Momi Noodle House,4,So good! There‚Äôs so many generic Asian food options around town it‚Äôs nice see something with a great personality & vibe ‚Äî and tasty and authentic food. The Don Don Combo was unreal. Server was a little underwhelming but still a great stop.
Momi Noodle House,5,"My friend brought me in when I was visiting her in BC. LOVE their cute little space! The rice noodles are delicious, and the side dishes are also very Chinese, highly recommended."
Momi Noodle House,3,"Sorry but this is not the Chinese food that I had in my mind. I don‚Äôt know why but maybe because I used to go to a restaurant in Amman and it was one of the best so that what I saved for Chinese food. So it didn‚Äôt meet my expectations.
The service is excellent.
The prices are reasonable for the the amount of the portion.
The bubble tea is a great option.
But I would never come back if I am going to go to Victoria."
Omakase,5,"Favourite sushi bar in Victoria. Great location to walk to if you‚Äôre downtown, near great shops off government street. Service is always excellent. The atmosphere is quiet and a great layout, not a huge place so at peak times you may have to wait for a table. I‚Äôve purchased takeout as well and quality is still superior to other sushi takeout. A favourite place of mine for lunch. The food is top notch, always peak freshness, excellent presentation as well."
Omakase,5,"Make a reservation, because the fact that our reserved group of 6 (the max they'll reserve for) went on a Tuesday evening and the place was just packed, says it all. Really good food; really good service. If you love sushi, do not miss this opportunity. And if you have celiac disease, just ask for gluten-free options and they'll have you covered. I went there with my gluten-free Meetup and it was excellent. Reasonable prices too, considering the times we live in. A great date-night idea in the heart of downtown."
Omakase,5,"I have eaten at many sushi restaurants and this one definitely places among the very best. The fish was so fresh with a buttery texture, the green tea refreshing and well-presented, the service was excellent and the prices were good. If I lived here I would eat here at least once per week. Highly recommended!"
Omakase,5,"We had an excellent experience, with friendly staff, great food and honest prices."
Omakase,3,"My work colleague rants and raves of this place all the time and had been bugging me to go all these months. I finally did somewhat reluctantly; I had a one-time unpleasant experience eating here with my dad when I was 16 (my older daughter is currently this age just to give you a time stamp) and had bad diarrhea afterwards, nearly missing my first Young Drivers appointment back in the day. üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Food quality is okay. The sashimi is fresh but not that huge deal that it melts in your mouth and you must go here now that I read in other reviews. ü§î As you can see, the presentation for their large assorted sashimi is very lacking; 15 pieces yes, but of very limited type and for the price? Not a good value to the eye of a sashimi connoisseur. My beef teriyaki was overcooked. They asked how I liked it done, I replied medium rare, but dish was medium borderline well done.

Service was there but quite slow; we were given the bill but took a very, very long time for them to come back for the POS. I mean, why bring the bill if you're not ready to accept payment right then and there, and made to wait? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

No stomach upset this visit which is a plus but even ordering their two biggest entrees, I left the place hungry still and underwhelmed. I feel this place is overhyped, would only go back here with accompaniment, and would most likely order something completely else on the menu. üôéüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
The Joint Pizzeria,5,Went here with my husband last Saturday night after going to a live music concert at a local bar. This finished the evening off perfectly! we tried their new garlic sauce pizza and practically ate the whole thing and their wings were fire! Next time I visit Victoria this will again be the night cap location. Ps PLEASE keep making the garlic white sauce pizza!!! So good!
The Joint Pizzeria,5,Amazingly delicious gluten-free perogy pizza. Crust was so good! Toppings were fantastic! Highly recommend ordering from here.
The Joint Pizzeria,5,Insanely good Gluten Free crust and BBQ chicken pizza. Have to try it ü§ç
The Joint Pizzeria,2,"Okay, let me start by saying I‚Äôve been in Victoria my whole life and I‚Äôve only had the odd slice here and there which has been great from The Joint. But ordered delivery for the first time and while the ingredients were fresh, dough really delicious, amazing texture and proportion to ingredients‚Ä¶.every single thing I got was so salty I could barely eat it. I am not someone why is scared of salt, infact I usually salt food even when people don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary.
Maybe it is a one off, and I will probably give them another try‚Ä¶ but Joint, just thought I should let you know! Should be the best later night deliver place! (Also fyi delivery was prompt, pizza was fresh, delivery guy great)"
The Joint Pizzeria,4,The Joint makes an excellent gluten free thin crust vegetarian pizza and it comes in two sizes which is unusual for gluten free.  Love the tomatoes and feta cheese. Just the right amount of saltiness from the feta. Have had this pizza three times in the past month! The business has been taken over by new owners who are very friendly. The restaurant is in an old part of town. Was very clean however the washroom needs a bit of help!
Pho Wisdom,5,"The Pho was excellent. The bowls were larger than the portions so once we added sprouts, it wasn't overflowing, which was great. The atmosphere was quiet and spacious, clean and not posh. The staff was attentive, asking about food allergies and ensuring we were comfortable and well-provided."
Pho Wisdom,4,"We got the special pho soup. It was good, nothing out of the ordinary, just enough meat but seems less than some photos I've seen on some reviews. We also thought their menu prices are high eg the bhan mi (sandwich) at ~$16 (maybe it's a foot long? ü§îüòõ) We were just happy to find a place open til 9pm as most others close earlier. May or may not come back depending on competition's current prices on the same items."
Pho Wisdom,4,"Spectacular service.
Menu offers many vegan options and I had no difficulty also finding items that are also gf.
The location is easy to find and was clean and inviting when we visited.

My vegan friendly soup was hot and flavourful. The kitchen was able to accommodate my request for specific vegetables (due to allergies) and it was very good.
My partner opted for a vegan friendly curry and it was stunning when it arrived.

Pay parking was available on the street outside of the restaurant and we will return to try other items.

We visited on a weekend in the early afternoon and enjoyed our visit."
Pho Wisdom,3,"I went here 1 night when my usual spot of Pho Vy was closed because it was after 8pm. It was a very average Pho. The broth was very bland. Not untasty, just very watery and bland. Service was friendly and efficient. Maybe their other meals are more flavourful but the Pho was distinctly average."
Pho Wisdom,3,"Average experience, seems a bit overpriced for content and quality, but not familiar with pricing in this neighborhood. Nice service though."
Beijing Bistro,5,We had steamed rock fish and eggplant with ground pork. Both are very authentic and tasty. Service was very good and got good recommendations. We highly recommend this place!
Beijing Bistro,5,"What a wonderful surprise ‚ù£Ô∏è. Fantastic tasty fresh food, of good proportions, cooked by a 30 year experienced Beijing chef.  Service was fabulous, with a very humble, kind, gracious, friendly and gentle server.  Didn‚Äôt have to wait at all for food to be prepared hot and fresh, even though they were busy with a constant stream of online delivery orders, and dine-in patrons. Humble environment, which only makes the experience more of an amazing meal. $$$"
Beijing Bistro,5,Amazing food and service. The special fish is so unique and tasty. I really recommend it.
Beijing Bistro,2,"Good service. But the food was done incorrectly. Some dish done with wrong sauce, or cut vegetable in a wrong way that completely not washed, or meat under cooked.

According to the  menu, some dishes are pro-level and not regular home chief can handle. But the food we got today is not up to average chinese parent level.

The food quality is hard to justify these high score reviews, maybe something went wrong with their chief or management."
Beijing Bistro,5,Awesome Chinese restaurant with authentic food from North East China. Love the dumplings and steamed fish!
Sarpino's Pizzeria (Downtown Victoria),2,"We ordered take out from a long day of traveling and touring Victoria. Craving a good pizza, wings and Cheese Sticks. Pizza was ok. Wings were meh, not worth the money honestly as they weren't even salted and peeppered like advertised if no sauce was picked, finally the cheese Bread sticks were unedible. They were way too crunchy, barely any cheese and didn't even taste like there was garlic butter on them. We try and support local but to have so many meh moments was not appealing to our appetites. More than half of it went into the garbage"
Sarpino's Pizzeria (Downtown Victoria),4,"Pizza is okay with good quality ingredients. They have a good deal if you buy 2 pizzas of any size.
They also got a few tables if you want to dine in."
Sarpino's Pizzeria (Downtown Victoria),5,"From the charming little shop to the delicious mouth watering smell of carrying it to my car and the savoring of my very first bite, I loved the whole experience of trying their pizza for the first time.
I'm a big pizza fan and this one deserves a place up there, the ingredients were of quality and generous, everything from the smell to the taste spoke of quality, price was very decent and the sauce was delicious (a little bit more on the sweet than the salty side for those who might prefer this).
I recommend."
Sarpino's Pizzeria (Downtown Victoria),2,"Ordered double mushroom pizza - could not taste the mushrooms!
Mushrooms were sliced so thin, I mean paper thin and quantity was very low.
Shameless saving on toppings is evident. I felt cheated. Taste of crust, cheese, sauce is just OK"
Sarpino's Pizzeria (Downtown Victoria),5,"Pretty good if you need a quick pizza downtown.

What makes it great is the friendly franchise owner, he's always working away and making sure everything is just right."
erito sushi,1,"I had the sashimi bento. The sashimi was average, but the teriyaki chicken was disgusting. The sauce it came in was way too thick and the meat was unseasoned. I would recommend staying away from this place."
erito sushi,5,"First time I've been here in a couple years. I had the teriyaki beef combo meal and the mixed tempura, the portion sizes were huge! Very delicious, very satisfied, 10/10"
erito sushi,4,"Bento boxes were good, though you may need extra sauce. Sushi is mostly packaged and in the case by the entrance, but it was all very tasty. I enjoyed the sashimi bento box with a generous helping of salmon - delicious! Great for a quick meal."
erito sushi,5,"Got the bento, it was fast and fresh! Pre-rolled sushi is not bad as well."
erito sushi,4,"Decent price for decent food, have mainly tried the sushi here which tends to be a bit dry yet I'd expect the ""made to order"" food would solve this issue. Overall if in the area would recommend."
Tractor Foods (Victoria),5,"I enjoy tractor food as I order regularly 2 market sides for lunch and this fills me just enough. Specifically the quinoa berry and the lemon kale salads. Mmmh extremely delicious & healthy. Some days I am feeling vegan some others carnivore and they have all the opinions to satisfy you, chicken, meatballs and tofu. I also sometimes like to buy their delicious muesli chia yogurt. This breakfast cup is my favourite. I just wished they did lower the music volume which at times is way too high. Staff is very friendly."
Tractor Foods (Victoria),5,"If your looking for a great healthy place to eat in Victoria this is the place!  They also have several Vegan options available!

We tried the Chicken Avocado Sandwich which was served on a Ciabatta Roll. We also tried the Nourish Bowl which comes with Power Greens & Brown Rice. You get the option to add two Market Sides to it. We chose the Edamame Crunch & Lemon Kale.

Everything was great. Plenty of indoor seating, also a great outdoor area as well that looks towards the harbor.

Pet Friendly Patio."
Tractor Foods (Victoria),5,"We just tried two of the hot bowls (Thai curry and Moroccan stew + brown rice) and it was absolutely divine! The stews were extremely flavorful with all the spices, and it tasted just like a home cooked meal. Definitely plan on ordering from tractor regularly from now on!"
Tractor Foods (Victoria),5,"Best local hidden gem in downtown!! This is a business that I would totally support any time. Best quality of food, fresh; healthy, and hearty! Friendly and knowledgeable staff, always welcoming and give lots of thoughts in preparing the food. Best part - their coffee and pastries. I love the dark chocolate pistachio cookies and the dark chocolate banana bread. come here every week we are in downtown"
Tractor Foods (Victoria),5,"I'm only mad that I've been living in Victoria for 2 years and just now trying this place. I love healthy food, but I know it's hard to make it taste good. I got a yogurt Parfait and an everyday bowl with Quinoa and Blueberries. Every bite was packed with flavor and freshness. Staff were also very friendly and kind."
Five Spice Indian Cuisine,3,"We used to get takeaway from here quite regularly.  Very nice website, it was very nice food.  Now Sooke has a local Indian restaurant we love so we don‚Äôt go here anymore in the last year.
Five Spice is a little takeaway spot inside a convenience store in Happy Valley and it was such a gem of a find when we moved to Sooke from up island.
We were in the neighborhood last Saturday night and decided to call in an order.  We get there, the guy at the counter told me that it‚Äôll be 2 minutes.  Finally we get our order 15 minutes later after multiple people come to pick theirs up, very busy night.
We ordered the Palak Paneer, Butter Chicken, lamb biryani with a couple of naans and sides of plain rice as well as coconut rice.
The paneer dish was great, spice level spot on.  The other dishes that were our usual picks were unfortunately not great.  The butter chicken lacked its depth of flavour and the biryani was a tad dry, flavours were there but it was as if the volume was turned way down.  Lamb itself was decent but biryani is usually a bit more moist and comes with a side of raita but tonight it didn‚Äôt.
The coconut rice was interesting, not sure if that‚Äôs their own version but it had fried bits of the coconut cream which lent a toasty flavour but left the rice quite oily.  And then the naans.  Oh dear, it was nothing like we‚Äôve had before when the naan is sort of light and bubbly almost.  It was the opposite.  The naan were like flat bread.  Thick and heavy.

I‚Äôm thinking since it was very close to closing time on a Saturday they were just super busy and were pumping out so much food that the quality suffered a bit."
Five Spice Indian Cuisine,5,Foods are amazing that I wouldn't mind to take a 1.5h bus to eat. Just note there is no seats for dine in.
Five Spice Indian Cuisine,5,Really delicious food. I recommend it. Only Take Out. You need to head into the convenience store and go right. The counter has a little bell. Don't be shy. Ring the bell. I'd recommend ordering ahead and popping in to pick up.
Five Spice Indian Cuisine,5,"As good as it gets. One of the best Indian meals we have had in many years. Not to be missed. Thank you to the new owners, your warm hospitality and outstanding dishes, each and every one of them, made for one of the most memorable meals for a very long time. Congratulations. We'll be back :-)"
Five Spice Indian Cuisine,1,"Unfortunately we will not be eating here again. Besides the long wait, poor service at the counter, and confusing our order, the quality is very poor. Meat tasted old, curry sauce is far too sweet and tasted like it came pre made from a jar, and the quality of the food does not justify the price. Really disappointing because it used to be alright. Never going here again, especially because they have also raised their prices. Can tell the quality of the ingredients has gone way down."
Hecklers Bar & Grill,5,"Hecklers is such a great spot. They have the best priced and best tasting wings on Island! You can't compete with all those flavour options! There daily specials are so enticing. And they make it super fun by offering free foosball, retro games, trivia... And comedy nights are hilarious! Our friend group loves hecklers ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Hecklers Bar & Grill,5,"Best place to get wings, $8 a pound on Wednesday with around 20+ choices of flavours between sauces and dry rubs. Quite a popular spot with really nice staff and ambiance. Went with 3 other friends and got 2 types each. Had a great time."
Hecklers Bar & Grill,5,"Went for one of their Saturday comedy shows! Didn‚Äôt buy tickets like they recommended but were fortunately able to squeeze us in.

We got to see 3 different sets from comics from around Canada who were all great! The host was also super funny and I enjoyed his presence.

Our server was quick and surprisingly didn‚Äôt forget to check in on us to offer more drinks throughout the show.

Highly recommend checking it out for a unique experience or date night!"
Hecklers Bar & Grill,5,"Went here for their wing Wednesday, these wings were the best wings I've ever had, I'd fly out to Victoria just for them"
Hecklers Bar & Grill,5,"This place impresses me. Good service, good food, very fair prices. Jake was our bartender last night and treated us very well.
The only issue I have is that I've been living in the Gorge for 3 years now and haven't checked this place out sooner! Great job guys :)"
The Tropical Island Restaurant,5,"In a word... Amazing!

I brought my wife and son here for our fifth anniversary.  They provide a cozy, inviting atmosphere that relaxes and inspires.

We started out with the Roti Canai and Popcorn Chicken.  Excellent starters for a fine meal.

We then proceeded to indulge with the Gu Loo Pork, Seafood Teppan, and Mixed Mushroom Platter.  Wonderful.

The food and service were excellent.  I will definitely be back and will let others know as well, which is easily done as I work in the hospitality industry.

Thank you so much Tropical Island Restaurant for helping to make this a meaningful and memorable anniversary."
The Tropical Island Restaurant,5,Parking lot was small. Staff was very friendly and food was excellent. Would go back next time we're in Victoria.
The Tropical Island Restaurant,5,"The BEST South East Asian cuisine in the town and the Pha Thai is my favorite. We had a very good dining experience in this little gem. I'm very pleased with the quality of food and the amazing services. The staff and the owner are very friendly and approachable.
Many thanks for the delicious food and wonderful service, we can't wait to visit the Tropical Island restaurant again next week. ‚ò∫Ô∏è."
The Tropical Island Restaurant,5,"Fresh, fabulous, best lunch in Greater Victoria. Two sampler plate offers for 2 ($39) or more persons is exceptional. We had the non-vegetarian special - spring rolls with pickled veggies, curry chicken, spicy beef, roasted veggies, rice. Individual combo plates also avail for lunch. Perfect, prompt service. Great mix of Malaysian, Thai & Chinese dishes on the menu. I will return!"
The Tropical Island Restaurant,4,"Small and neat restaurant with few tables. Furniture reminds anyone an authentic countryside resto. Ambiance is good. Ample parking.
Service is good.
Food is must try, quality is good for the price. Spice level was customized as per our needs"
Vietnam Garden Restaurant,4,I haven't been here for years but the food and service is still great!  I had the lunch special Singapore Curry Noodles and my friend had Noodles with chicken and prawns. We both got about 10 prawns each in our dishes. Both meals were delicious!
Vietnam Garden Restaurant,5,Great locla mom and pop place.  Order of the wall or get Caramel Fish or 5 spiced Squid. Best in Town!  Support local!
Vietnam Garden Restaurant,5,"Fantastic little spot in Esquimalt. Will be my go to place for a variety of Asian cuisines. Menu has a wide assortment of flavorful dishes, and service was excellent. Very cozy and cheerful atmosphere inside."
Vietnam Garden Restaurant,5,First time customer and not disappointed! Generous portions. I had the Shrimp Combo and an Avocado Shake. Both were excellent. Looking forward to trying other menu items.
Vietnam Garden Restaurant,4,"Great food, friendly staff. They have really good lemon grass beef noodle soup or spicy cashew chicken. Their dessert menu also packs quite a few surprises like the Deep Fried Banana(see picture). The prices are fair and the location is nice and quiet. They have ample parking in the back of the restaurant."
YUMMY TRUCK,1,Terrible experience. I‚Äôm sorry but putting processed rotten tasting chicken and processed cheese slices on you club sandwich Is a joke. People are paying you good money to eat and you offer garbage. I won‚Äôt even start on the fries üòí just bad all around.
YUMMY TRUCK,5,Great Flaffle wrap and great customer service
YUMMY TRUCK,5,Great shawarma. Best I have ever had actually. It took a few minutes to make but it was so fresh it was worth the wait. Friendly service too. Will definately return. Located behind the museum
YUMMY TRUCK,5,"This shawarma tastes like heaven! Try the beer shawarma with garlic sauce if you like the garlic taste, it is great!"
YUMMY TRUCK,5,"One of the best wrap kebab of my life.
Service fast and just perfect."
Futaba,4,"Stopped in for takeout and tried the spicy salmon and the spicy tuna roll. Flavour was excellent, but it took almost an hour to be ready. Definitely call and order ahead! They seemed frazzled with various online order platforms as well as numerous in-person takeout patrons, and with only 1 man behind the counter preparing the food, it's no surprise that they were having a really hard time keeping up with orders."
Futaba,1,"Decided to try this place. NEVER AGAIN.... I ordered the yakitori and the spider tempura through skip the dishes.

TL;DR: soggy, oily, squished food, bland, sauce unsecured.

Yakitori: Chicken completely unseasoned. was it boiled? bland. Green onions were soggy. oh! and to top it off, the sauce spilled through the container all on the bottom of the bag and on my furniture.

Spider Tempura: The sauce... i think it is straight vinegar. for some perspective, partner is a huge fan of salty, sour and vinegary things. salt and vinegar on fries, potato chips, puts 10 sour skittles in his mouth at a time, will eat the sugar on the bottom too and eats plain feta with nothing else. He said it was too much.

and the crab itself.... i paid 10 dollars for a miniscule portion. Now i understand seafood and fried things are oily but this was dripping. Soggy like applesauce or a wet cracker, and i think they... fried it with the shell on? but i could be wrong. how is it tempura if you dont get to eat the artery clogging fried bits? I tried it, I really did. It made me slightly nauseous, you would have to pay me very handsomely to take another bite.

My partner got the yam tempura and teriyaki chicken sushi. The yam tempura was okay, but its hard to mess that up. The sushi was alright but it was cut unevenly, and squished. This is seriously the worst food I've had in a long time."
Futaba,3,"The place and the atmosphere there is nice. Service is ok. Problem here is the sushi rice. I ordered the sushi boat, and kinda disappointed because the rice has NO flavor. You suppose to season the sushi rice, not just give me plain rice. Fish is fresh and tasty, so it's not too too bad."
Futaba,2,"Did take out - bring your own bag or ask about packaging price for your order!
They charged 0.15cents for a brown paper bag without mentioning it until I saw it in the receipt and the order was already in the bag, STAPLED closed.

The food was ok - yam roll was good. Portion of maki were small which was expected but there was barely any fish, so it was mainly rice."
Futaba,2,"Ordered through skip the dishes. The portions were small -- the chicken teriyaki was especially small for the price. The tuna sashimi was partially frozen and not sliced well. As you can see in the picture we did not get much for $100. You can also see how unappetizing the tuna sashimi looks.

Taste was ok, but for the money not worth it. We ordered for 4 people and and the amount of food due to the portion sizes was insufficient."
7-Eleven (278 Tecumseh Rd E @ McDougall),5,Do not know why it took me so long to write this review. Gyros & More is probably my favorite spot to eat from in town. The food is good and constant with excellent customer service on each occasion. Would definitely recommend this spot to anyone to try.
7-Eleven (278 Tecumseh Rd E @ McDougall),5,"Amazing food , delicious and very nice costemer service üëç üòã üëå"
7-Eleven (278 Tecumseh Rd E @ McDougall),4,"Meat is always juicy full of flavour and service is fast. Every time I go in, I want to get something different but can't resist getting the classic Gyro w/ Salad. Salad isn't anything special but a large portion. I wish they used better tomatoes for the salad in the winter, the beefsteaks they use are not always ripe."
7-Eleven (278 Tecumseh Rd E @ McDougall),1,"I ordered gyro combo for $12
Was expecting hot and juicy flavourful wrap and some nice fries . To my surprise food was cold. Gyros were not even warm ! And they were salty. Fries were very salty and no flavour !!
Sauces in the wrap was also not flavourful at all. Over all it looked good but taste very bad. Definitely won‚Äôt recommend. Don‚Äôt believe me give it a try !"
7-Eleven (278 Tecumseh Rd E @ McDougall),4,"This is my first visit to this place. I will be back and enjoyed my lunch very much. The food was fresh, the meat was hot, tasty and lots of it. I would have liked a few more toppings but it's tough to complain when it tasted that good. The staff were kind and very helpful. I did notice a couple areas of improvement on the cleanliness side. The area where they keep the food containers was a little dusty and dirty but I have seen a lot worse. The dining area was fairly clean and the atmosphere is quaint. I ordered a Gyro Delight Combo with fries and gravy. The fries are nice and thick and appear to be freshly cut in store. I like skinnier french fries but I enjoyed them with their nice tasting gravy. I look forward to going back and it was a nice change from the regular fast-food places. UVbeenCridicked"
Burger King #13322 (300 Tecumseh Road East),2,"I don't live in windsor. Just came due to my daughter. I asked to lady who served me & also cashier after I paid the meal: ""may I have ketchup please, my daughter likes it with her fries"". She answered: ""here U go"" by throwing 6 packs right on TOP of her fries (NOT putting them nor placing but Throw). I told my daughter that her fries is dirty now & gave it to the birds & stray cat. I would gave the food 5 stars but due to such service I couldn't. I'm a business owner but never have I treated my clients disrespectful. I Believe that BUSINESSES THRIVE BASED ON THEIR CUSTOMERS & Customers deserve proper service"
Burger King #13322 (300 Tecumseh Road East),4,"Ordered 2 of the new Spicy Chicken Sandwiches with a large Cherry Coke. The cost was $16.35 which is the average price in fast food. I decided to go minus the Mayo and have them add the angry sauce for me. They were very good, I would even say delicious. They were nice and spicy. The buns were not the freshest I've ever had but that did not take away from my enjoyment. The restaurant isn't the cleanest but in no way was it a bother, I've seen way worse. I will also mention that I noticed a little caring in how I enjoyed my sandwiches because someone came up and asked. That never happens. I'm sure they make mistakes like everyone else, but today was a nice experience."
Burger King #13322 (300 Tecumseh Road East),4,"Girl at the cash was very rude. Like wow! Everyone else was nice and helpful. She should work in the back, not on the cash.

It was 1:30 and all the tables were gross and sticky. It was quiet in the restaurant.

Next time I'll get it to go."
Burger King #13322 (300 Tecumseh Road East),1,"I would give this restaurant zero stars if I could. The staff is so disrespectful. One of the staff member embarrassed me infront of everyone saying that I didn‚Äôt have enough money very loud to the coworker and when we told her that she didn‚Äôt have to say it that loud, she continued to give us attitude. This is also not the first time she has gave me and my friends attitude for no reason. She is just not a very friendly worker. Never going back!!!!"
Burger King #13322 (300 Tecumseh Road East),1,"Went in to grab myself lunch yesterday and got food poisoning. The floor was sticky, and I'm pretty sure the tables were too.

Also, why is this place listed as 24 hours when it isn't? Would that count as false advertising or an error on Google's part?"
Harvey's (Wyandotte Street W.),5,Rutuja was very kind and attentive when taking my family's order. Burgers were prepared to our liking; she was generous with the garlic mayo when requested. She even took the time to place everything in the bag in such a manner that the order would travel well and frings wouldn't be spilling all over the bag during the drive home. Thank you for your excellent customer service!
Harvey's (Wyandotte Street W.),3,"The food was good, but the guy in the back making the burgers had no gloves, just  raw-doggying the food with his bare hands.
The subway system they have going on where you pick your toppings is so bad. It creates traffic for no reason so it takes 10-15 minutes from ordering to getting your food."
Harvey's (Wyandotte Street W.),1,"I went in there today at 7:30PM , the cashier was so blunt and arrogant. I was standing right behind some local guy and she greeted him very good, But when my turn came she did not even say hello, She was being racist and She did not even hear me properly , she punched in the order. We had a mismatch of the order, and got only 2 items when we ordered 4. 35$ went to trash on the spot.
I would never recommend anyone to go at this particular Harvey‚Äôs."
Harvey's (Wyandotte Street W.),4,"It's my favorite spot for brunch be it night or noon. Besides, i mostly redeem my scene poi ts. Staff is always friendly. I always happen to find place to sit. Its crowded mostly in the evening. So sometimes it tales time for your order to come other than that the service is fast. No complaints about food. Try the buffalo chicken sandwich. I love it."
Harvey's (Wyandotte Street W.),4,"Harvey's is the second largest Canadian established restaurant chain in the country behind¬†Tim Hortons,and the fourth largest burger chain in Canada. Harvey's is one of Canada's longest standing Canadian owned and operated businesses. Harvey's is known for its¬†grilled¬†burgers and for providing customers with the choice of various toppings.
I ordered chicken nuggets and taste was very good."
Wendy's (55 Tecumseh Road West),5,Great stuff friendly. Service is awesome over all is fantastic. New fries is my new favourite. Ghost Pepper
Wendy's (55 Tecumseh Road West),5,I've been here a few times and everything was perfect. The service is pretty quick here.  The drive-thur is fast too.  The place inside is always clean and even the bathrooms. They also give free refills here on coffee. Breakfast here is also awesome üëç.
Wendy's (55 Tecumseh Road West),5,I went to this location om sat July 15th the girl at the speaker I believe her name was Emma sounded like she hated her job üòÇ but when I got to the window Dakota was so spunky and happy and so pleasant it made me go from a unhappy customer to a satisfied customer just by how friendly and professional he was.. that guy is going to do great things with his wonderful attitude and pleasant presence..thanks Dakota for making my not such a great day into a better evening.sometimes that's all the people need is a smile and Friendly attitude in these crazy times were in..
Wendy's (55 Tecumseh Road West),5,"Really great service. The location is convenient and easy to get in and out of on both bordering streets. They seem to be really busy here, but the store manager (different uniform) who was working the counter in the restaurant was attentive, friendly and really engaging. I felt welcomed and looked after by her. Food was good too."
Wendy's (55 Tecumseh Road West),1,"Was called a liar over the phone by ""Emma"" essentially when I called due to a mistake in my order. Disgrace of a fast food place. I get charged almost 20$, was given the wrong order and they have the audacity. Never going back to this spot."
Subway (33 University Ave),1,"I have worked for Subway for a long time, however this subway is not at all recommended. Reason being, poor staff attendance (please teach them how to talk to customers, and if not, they should not work in the food industry at all), they didn't even know which offer was valid or not (If the owner is reading this review, retraining is recommended), and also tell them how much quantity to use in which size of sandwich and how much. As an employee, I am aware of what they are unaware of.
However, in my opinion, it is not a recommended site to visit.
Overall, the worst employees that don't know how to talk and especially how to use tone...."
Subway (33 University Ave),4,"The highlight of my meal was the roast beef sandwich, served on toasted bread with a combination of cheddar and mozzarella cheese. It was absolutely delicious! The roast beef had a savory flavor that paired perfectly with the cheese. The toasted bread added a satisfying crunch to each bite. The staff at Subway were friendly and efficient, making my visit even more enjoyable. If you're a fan of roast beef sandwiches, I highly recommend giving Subway a try."
Subway (33 University Ave),1,"I'm a regular customer at this subway, many times I have visited there unfortunately always there is a girl who wears specks is extremely rude, and she always talk with loud voice, she doesn't know how to talk with people which is very bad for the customers as well as the reputation of subway. Poor subway!
Come on guys you have to give a proper training to the workers that how to talk people specially to that girl.
Very bad behaviour anytime.
I visited around 1:10 pm, date July 13th, 2023.
Give some respect to customers subway!"
Subway (33 University Ave),5,"I recently had the pleasure of ordering online from this sub store, and I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed with my experience. Despite the fact that the store is a bit far from my location, I have made it a point to order from them regularly because of the outstanding quality and attention to detail they provide.

I am giving them a 5/5 rating because they consistently make my sub perfectly, following all of my instructions to the letter. From the type of bread to the choice of vegetables and sauces, everything was prepared just the way I wanted it. It's clear that the staff takes pride in their work and strives to provide excellent customer service.

In terms of online delivery, I was also pleased with how smooth and easy the process was. The store provided accurate and timely updates on the status of my order, and the sub arrived fresh and hot, just as I had requested.

Overall, I highly recommend this sub store to anyone who loves delicious and customizable subs with excellent customer service. Whether you're nearby or a little far away like me, it's worth the effort to order from this store. Their attention to detail and commitment to quality make them stand out from the competition, and I will definitely be a loyal customer for years to come. Don't miss out on the opportunity to try their delicious subs - you won't regret it!"
Subway (33 University Ave),1,"Bathrooms destroyed by homeless folks.
Drink machine with a single flavour.
Drank cabinet with two flavours of bottles.

I thought subways were consistent and comfortable places for lunch, not this one.

The staff were the only saving grace."
Little Caesars (300 Tecumseh Road East),1,"So got the pretzel  pizza deal tonite for my birthday.  The pretzel bread was black they burned it, how nice to have  sacrificed  bread on your  birthday.
I won't be ordering  from  here again..
Completely  disgusted, can u ask  the cook to get glasses please?
They couldn't  tell it was black?"
Little Caesars (300 Tecumseh Road East),5,we usually order Chicago style pizza! it‚Äôs really good even though they don‚Äôt have that in online menu sometimes you have to ask it on call or in person.
Little Caesars (300 Tecumseh Road East),1,Poor customer service. Nothing ready. Ended up paying for and leaving without it. Got tired of waiting. Took the loss ended up going somewhere else.need to hire better staff. THIS PLACE REALLY SUCKS
Little Caesars (300 Tecumseh Road East),4,Dougall location forgot to give us the marinara sauce. We called them back but they didn‚Äôt answer because they were closing. So we called this location and they were very nice and told us to pick it up from them instead. We appreciated it so much!
Little Caesars (300 Tecumseh Road East),4,"If you want a great deal of taste and price, little Caesars is a good choice! Always delicious fresh bread stuff!Besides their pizza, I recommend ""Crazy Bread"", you won't regret.  the place is small and not good for dine-in, but take out is always a good solution !"
A&W (Dougall Ave),2,"Overall bad experience. Used to love this location but lately has gone down. Today being the worst. First I ordered the new nuggets, paid and everything then they come out to tell me they don't have them and want to give me something else, I had to fight them to give me my money back and the girl had to call her boss to ask if she could (I got the money). Then, I got my food before my mom who had order before me and apparently her order had been sitting in the line just not being bagged. Got home with the rest of the food and it was awful, over cooked burgers thrown together and cold."
A&W (Dougall Ave),4,"The fast food that you will come to eat when you come to Canada, it is very convenient and delicious, the price is reasonable, and the parking is convenient"
A&W (Dougall Ave),5,From America amd stopped on our way out..we were very pleased with our entire experience..thank you so much!
A&W (Dougall Ave),1,I don't know why it's so hard to make food the way you punch in the order. Was charged for cheese and bacon and this is what I get. Plus waited 20 minutes for food that was in no way fresh. Then when I call to speak to someone I get hung up on. I can't even believe the terrible customer service I received. What a joke.
A&W (Dougall Ave),1,"Worse burger and onion rings I have ever had. Wife went and got them and drove home with this garbage which they called food. Papa burger and onion rings were cold and they was nothing on the papa burger except one pickle. No ketchup mustard or mayonnaise. Onion rings were so crusty and well done they fell apart when you touched them. I use ro get these burgers faithfully and our children bought us certificates at Christmas before. I am 78 years old and I will never go our eat another piece of this garbage . Angry and dissatisfied.
Sincerely Wayne"
Leonidas Chocolates Caf√©,5,"Leonidas has stunning interior with a lot of beautiful decor. They have delicious desserts with great customer service! The prices were reasonable not overpriced at all in my opinion. I 100% recommend, it‚Äôs a very welcoming place and the staff there really treats everyone like family. Their special waffles and pancakes are to die for. Would definitely go again!"
Leonidas Chocolates Caf√©,5,"Went for my first time today. Excellent customer service! The food was great and they have a wide selection of chocolates and desserts. Pictured is my almond butter danish and cappuccino, my friend got the halloumi sandwich and some type of iced coffee‚Äî both were delish! Cute and aesthetic decor. My new go-to spot for a cute coffee date. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Leonidas Chocolates Caf√©,5,"Atmosphere is lovely and classy, we had sampled the chocolates and the quality is up there for sure. I ordered a frapp√© and it was honestly delicious! Fr glad Windsor opened up a nice proper cafe like this. They‚Äôve got alot of options in terms of sweets, such as ice cream and plenty of unique desserts. The staff at the front were really genuine and helpful!"
Leonidas Chocolates Caf√©,5,My friend and I came here today for brunch and we loved it. The decor was great (I particularly loved the green wall) and the employees were super nice! It became super packed immediately after we ordered our food but I don‚Äôt feel like the wait on the food was very long considering. And when we were eating we were also given free chocolate samples :)! Would recommend!
Leonidas Chocolates Caf√©,5,"This cafe has a beautiful ambience and great customer service. Lots of different food and drink options. At the entrance, they have cucumber and lemon flavoured water, which was a nice touch."
Church's Texas Chicken (2700 Tecumseh Rd W),5,"The food here was fresh and delicious! Absolutely in love with the chicken tenders, broasted, jalape√±o bombers, and their biscuits. Staff were extremely helpful and gave us the best customer service. We are so happy we visited their restaurant after hearing great compliments about this place. We drove from the U.S. to try their food and it was totally worth the drive. Will visit every time we are in Canada! Thank you guys :)"
Church's Texas Chicken (2700 Tecumseh Rd W),2,"Slow service (only 2 people preparing as well as serving) - took 10 mins to prepare an order than you can get within a minute at popeyes across from street.
Stars are for chicken only- only thing that tasted reasonable
Poutine tasted like an indian gravy
Chicken wrap was not fresh
Regular fries (had 6-7 fries only)
Not worth it for the price
More expensive than popeyes."
Church's Texas Chicken (2700 Tecumseh Rd W),3,"I decided to give this place a try thinking it would be different from Popeyes chicken from across the street. I actually stopped at Popeye's chicken and parked my car and the parking lot and decided to go across the street instead.
I have to be honest that I didn't think it was much different from Popeyes. I did appreciate that. The sides were a little different but I don't think the jalapeno poppers being a side would sway me come back again.
The staff were nice. They wanted to upcharge me for a thigh which I was not impressed about. I've never been upcharged for dark meat when they don't have white meat. Other than that, the staff remember who served me was very kind. I'm glad I tried it so I won't wonder about it again. Prices were very comparable and the chicken tasted no different than your average fried chicken. Hot sauce is not provided with the chicken. I had to ask for a dipping sauce which was an upcharge as well."
Church's Texas Chicken (2700 Tecumseh Rd W),1,"Absolutely terrible food for the $21.00 I paid. The chicken was VERY pale. The chicken sandwich was harder than a rock. I suspect I got chicken that was past it's hold time. I got the churro bites to save the meal and they were bland no flavour overcooked and greasy. I recommend anyone go to any other QSR for a spicy chicken sandwich as Church's is definitely the worst. Overall, a really unfortunate experience I will not be going back here again."
Church's Texas Chicken (2700 Tecumseh Rd W),4,"10/26/22: the food was pretty good but when I was not told that there's an extra charge for a bottled can or even spicy mayo. I had to ask them that. I would really appreciate if the customers are told if there is an extra charge than what is shown on the display. Also I know it's been a couple of months since they opened but it did seem kind of messy the one time.

First review:
Heard of this place in town, went to check it out and it was packed. Since it was the new place in town, I get it why it was so busy. Made 2 orders and it took about 15-20 mins. They did forget about one of my order but when I reminded about them, they got to it immediately and even gave me 2 extra sandwich for the delay. So I really appreciate them for that. Food tasted really great especially those honey biscuits were crazy good. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because they forgot the fries in one order and the sauces. However I'll give this place another try since it's just the first week."
Pita Pit 3065 Howard ave,4,"The taste is really good of a falafel but still it‚Äôs a very expensive wrap. The place is just located on the other side in front of Devonshire Mall. There are lot parking spots and also workers are really friendly.

The restaurant is clean."
Pita Pit 3065 Howard ave,5,"Love the location of the new Pita Pit! Fast, friendly and great service. Tons of parking and very clean inside! We both got chicken pits with different veggies and sauce on it. Great for a refreshing taste of veggies and meat!

Employees working here are very friendly, like I went with 4 friends of mine, we all had different choices of veggies, souces, cheese. I didn't remember her name but she gave us full time yo think what should we choose, the service is too best.
Must recommend, it's very healthy to eat as compared to junk foods."
Pita Pit 3065 Howard ave,5,This is a first time we ordered through uber eats. I have to say a great meal  and very tasty  and Amazing food.  Definitely recommend ordering. I ordered beef and chicken wrap I have to say beef wrap was more delicious then chicken wrap. All in all I will order again.üòâ
Pita Pit 3065 Howard ave,5,"The food is fresh, staff is super friendly and they have Yogen Fruz ice cream! Bonus! My recommendation: Chicken Souvlaki with hummus. Plus, they never charge for guac at Pita Pit. Great location too and plenty of seating."
Pita Pit 3065 Howard ave,2,"This store needs to pay more attention when bagging Skip the Dishes orders. One order they forgot 1 of 2 pitas, 2nd order they put the wrong kind of chips in the bag."
KFC (3100 Howard Ave unit FCU1),5,Very good and friendly service from person delth me with friendly manner and I got what I asked thank you KFC DEVONSHIRE MALL
KFC (3100 Howard Ave unit FCU1),5,"When I want #friedchicken #chicken üêî #Iam, a huge fan of #KFC chalk to up to #childhood #memories of salty crispy delicious chicken üòã and I love the gravy like seriously I want a bucket of chicken n gravy and I'm good üëç"
KFC (3100 Howard Ave unit FCU1),1,If I  could give a zero I would went through drive thru and sat for 3 to 5 minutes waiting honked my horn and still no response. Last time I waste my time.
KFC (3100 Howard Ave unit FCU1),1,"The man at front is very rude.
He gave 3 orders after mine ! And I ordered just a single sandwich! Very disappointed with that guy !"

Taco Bell (300 Tecumseh Rd),3,"Taco bell

Pros.

The mountain Dew was great.

Cons.

Ordered 2 nacho tacos. Didn't get them. Got some other thing with beans. I did not like it.  The 2 normal hard tacos were smashed into the bag. The nahco supreme was placed sideways and spilled all over.
Had a hard time ordering because there was a group of people smoking in the drive through.

I am just done with this location."
Taco Bell (300 Tecumseh Rd),1,Extremely rude and disrespectful mannager on the late night shift! Made my unpleasant experience of having a long hair in my cheesy Gordita Crunch even worse!! Refused to rectify the issue at hand. So I will no longer be visiting this location
Taco Bell (300 Tecumseh Rd),5,The staff are so friendly. The food is always so yummy and they have fast speedy service.
Taco Bell (300 Tecumseh Rd),1,"So a while back I had a terrible experience with an Employee named Matthew at the Ouellette location, left a review on his behavior.
So why is it, that when I go to this Taco Bell I get the same guy?
Are we just shuffling the same bad employees between locations as if he's suddenly gonna be pleasant at the next one?

Update:
On the weekend I decided to give this location a second shot.
That was a mistake.
Matthew is still as unpleasant as ever and the food was almost as bad as his attitude.
How would I go about filing a complaint with management?"
Taco Bell (300 Tecumseh Rd),2,I ordered for a pickup and my food was packed when I arrived yet they made me wait for 10min for a regular drink even tho it was not a rush hour. The food got soft. Need to train the staff.
Shawarma Shack,5,"One of the best shawarma spots in Windsor. I have had their shawarma few years ago and it was OK. I have decided to go back to give it another try last week and I was impressed. This time I have tried their Chicken Shawarma sandwich with garlic and hot sauce only. I had some pickles on the side. The chicken was tender and packed with great flavours. Bread was fresh and perfectly toasted. Their garlic has a great taste. Great customer service and they are generous with their portions. Will visit again to try their Beef shawarma and will report back.

Went back a week later to try the beef Shawarma and wow  I was impressed. The meat was flavorful and tender. Their tahini sauce is packed with flavours and not watery. We also ordered some French fries and it was fried to perfection."
Shawarma Shack,5,"Abe and his wife have built up an amazing restaurant. It all starts the moment you walk in you are met with a smile. Staff is great and the food is fantastic, the flavours, the smell, the texture and the taste. You can get a quick Shawarma or an entire meal. We have used Shawarma Shack to cater several events. The catering is on time and the food, just as delicious as in house. The owners are some of the nicest people you‚Äôll ever meet. Thank you Shawarma Shack for a great food experience. If you love Shawarma this is the place to go and if you‚Äôve never tried Middle Eastern food this place will definitely impress you."
Shawarma Shack,5,"One of my favorite Windsor shawarma restaurants! Food is always fresh, It's made right in front of you and the portions are very reasonable. My usual and favorite is the chicken shawarma salad. And that garlic sauce!! 100%"
Shawarma Shack,4,"Nice little place alongside walker road. Centrally located between amour automotive manufacturing companies
Tried their mega shawarma with beef and falafel. Taste was pretty good and felt like they do good job with cooking the meat however I dint understand their regular shawarma or mega shawarma as the other cost a dollar more
Would like to try their kebab next time"
Shawarma Shack,1,"The service here was excellent; young man at the counter was attentive and friendly in explaining the menu.

Unfortunately that‚Äôs where the positive ends. The chicken shawarma was positively the worst I‚Äôve ever had. Growing up in a middle eastern community and dining across the world, I‚Äôve come to expect different adaptations of this renowned delicacy. Though it didn‚Äôt seem like a one off judging from the preparation of orders ahead, they used an extremely excessive amount of tahini, extremely dry chicken, and disproportionate vegetables. I had high expectations here but was extremely disappointed (ontop of the extremely high price-per-portion)."
Station Restaurant [Windsor],5,Better service than previous owners. Updated menu and they now accept debit and credit. Huge portions and cheap prices. If your hungry like a lion come here.
Station Restaurant [Windsor],1,"I use to go this restaurant for years. They had the best food. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. But I must say, they are not the best anymore. I order food twice already. Pick up and delivery I tried & both times, my food was not good. My bread was soggy, the food was just thrown in the box, AND the home fries‚Ä¶. WERE NOT COOKED THOROUGHLY. For my dine in, it was the same situation. The food is not cooked thoroughly. It‚Äôs a shame that the new owners are not keeping that standard of their reputation & the food isn‚Äôt as good as it use to be. The food is cheap which is good but I see why it is cheaper. I will not be eating here anymore."
Station Restaurant [Windsor],5,The pizza was really good I felt like it was made form the heart. I would definitely come back when I go back to Windsor
Station Restaurant [Windsor],2,"EDIT:

This place used to be great but the new owners are more money conscious and now the prices aren't so great. Still greasy food fair but there are much better deals in the city, sadly.

Old Review:

Great food, great prices!

This place is no-frills! Its a greasy spoon, good breakfast at WOW prices.

Want to go out and fill up on the cheap? Come here!"
Station Restaurant [Windsor],3,"Not the same as previous owners. Will I return, maybe.
Service today not good at all. The girl server needs to be more attentive of the customers, not eat and chat on phone while ignoring customers.  Didn't ask us how all is going or even come by to refill coffee. Very lax at cleaning up tables!"
El Mayor,5,"Food was excellent
Service was phenomenal
Atmosphere was just right
You'll have to try it to believe it.   Food was prepared fresh and to taste.  The aroma coming from the meal was splendid and delightful.  The waitress was very attentive to our needs and helped out with everything we asked for.  Can't wait for next outing here."
El Mayor,5,What an amazing meal! You see and taste the quality of the food from your first to your last bite. I really appreciate when you can see how spotless the kitchen is in a restaurant.  Truly authentic and Kat gave us top notch service! Can't wait to come back!
El Mayor,5,"5 stars overall!! This restaurant is amazing!!

The platters are so good - We usually have the BBQ platter for 2-3 people.

Everything in this place tastes amazing. My personal favourites are the Fattoush Salad (for all the crispy things!) and Baba Ganouj.

The Kafka also tastes great, and the Mixed (Chicken and Beef) Shawarma plate has everything you need for a good and filling meal. The Garlic sauce is just *chefs kiss*

The service is also amazing! They will answer all your questions and help you identify the best meal for you based on your preferences. They are very helpful!

We go to Windsor just to eat at this restaurant!"
El Mayor,5,"We had an early dinner after a long drive to Wi fair. We enjoyed the fattoush and baba ghanoj.
We also had the leg of lamb and fattit shawarma.
Food was great, was served quick and the staff at the restaurants were nice and friendly with all customers. This is a great to go to spot while
In Windsor"
El Mayor,5,"Great middle eastern food with friendly service. Really enjoyed their salads, they were very fresh and flavorful. Really enjoyed both the beef and chicken shawarma!"
Burrito Bueno,5,Windsor's best kept secret. Every item on the menu is phenomenal and made fresh. I called them after my first bite to give my compliments to the chef whom is also the owner. Give this place a shot you will not regret it!
Burrito Bueno,5,"In town from Fort Worth, Texas to visit family and heard of Burrito Bueno! We had to try it. My children, who are both picky eaters, love their original burrito bowl and River City burrito and that‚Äôs saying something! Taquitos are amazing - fun idea! My native Texan husband is loving the River City bowl and smothered potatoes. Salsa is greatness. Great job Burrito Bueno! We‚Äôll be back!"
Burrito Bueno,5,The Fajita Brekkie Bowl was amazing! I recommend extra Bueno Sauce and Fresh Salsa. Food was ready quickly and the staff was warm and pleasant. I will be adding this to my restaurant rotations for sure!
Burrito Bueno,3,"It's a decent breakfast burrito (I've tried the super and also the spinach).

Take out or delivery only

The Nickel and diming is a bit much. 2 bucks for sour cream? Everything is a la carte.

It's fine they are a decent size (a bit larger than a can of pop) and they taste, fine.

Don't expect to be blown away by flavour or value."
Burrito Bueno,5,"Windsor finally has its breakfast burrito kitchen. By far the best breakfast burrito I had in Canada. Owner is from Texas and burritos are Texas size üòç. Amazing variety , Delicious and filling. Going to be making more frequent trips to this joint."
Himchuli Authentic Asian Cuisines,5,"So for now, I will definitely give them a 5 star for the quality and price. The chicken curry was different. I know that changes within the different cuisines of India, this felt like a homely food. Will try next time and update!"
Himchuli Authentic Asian Cuisines,5,"This is one of my absolute favourite places to eat!
Nepali and Indian cuisine. Intense flavours.

Everything-- is SO delicious!

We drive to London, ON to get momos.
Authentic Nepali momos are here now in our home city of Windsor!

We also like the thali.
Must try: everything!

Momos- steamed (we like chicken). Comes with a nice sauce on the side.

Chili momos come with fried onion, peppers and cilantro. They're spicy (avoid if you do not like spice).

Kashmiri aalu dum (potato). Sweet, cardamom curry with a soft potato. (Comes in a thali)

Rotis! Melt in your mouth, authentic- simple yet so delicious. I don't even need a curry. Just eat 5 of them straight!

International students!! 7 days a week Tiffin service! Check out the picture for the description.

The owner was the chef from India 47 and is a Nepali actor with a great story how he came to Canada. Chat him up. He's a nice guy and we wish him and his endeavors the very best!

You're truly missing out if you never try him and his wife's amazing food!"
Himchuli Authentic Asian Cuisines,5,"We went here for lunch and were surprised  to discover the authentic taste of Nepal in Windsor.The momos are to die for specially the jhol momos , I‚Äôm a die hard fan of momos and trust me when I say they are good. I also tried their non-veg thali  & in that my favourite was the mutton curry . The portions are good enough & everything is fresh on the menu , would highly recommend this place."
Himchuli Authentic Asian Cuisines,4,"Ordered veg and chicken steam momo through DoorDash, taste was good but restaurant should focus more on delivery boxes as steam momo were sticking on paper box surface making it break in to pieces. Other restaurants use aluminum foil for take out orders."
Himchuli Authentic Asian Cuisines,5,"The food here is excellent! All the dishes we tried- Chicken Thali (chicken curry, grilled eggplant, mixed vegetable, rice, raita and pop), Chicken Biriyani, Chicken MoMos steamed and masala tea- have infused flavour. Perfect balance of rice and oil.

The owner was head chef from India 47 and a Nepali actor (received Hotel Management in Bombay). Super nice guy and excellent flavours.

MoMos are very authentic and homemade. Biriyani is killer flavour too. Eggplant is so flavourful.

Come support local! We wish you the very best Puskar on your dream here in Windsor!"
Bobby Burrito & Taco,5,I had a quesadillas today. It was wonderful. I would totally recommend this place. Food is just wow!!!
Bobby Burrito & Taco,5,"We get their taco salad bowls al the time!! The portions are great for the value and VERY fresh!! My go-to is the beef... Yum!
If you haven't tried them, it's a must!"
Bobby Burrito & Taco,5,I have had food from this place multiple times and I haven't had a bad experience. The food is so good and reasonably priced. I had the chorizo regular bowl and it was so goooood. I really recommend this place to anyone looking for some good Mexican food.
Bobby Burrito & Taco,5,"We just moved into the area and we're pleasantly surprised to find Bobby's around the corner. The food great, at a great price and the ladies behind the counter are always happy. A friend of ours who helped us move declared he would be coming to visit us just to eat at Bobby's."
Bobby Burrito & Taco,1,"I'm very disappointed on the butter chicken they had with the bowl. I have never seen a butter chicken in white color. Or if you're preparing a chicken with no butter chicken masala, please name it different. This can avoid confusions. For the pros, I can say that the price value is good but definitely the food lacks taste!!"
Shawarma Hot Spot,5,"A chicken shawarma combowith potatoes and spicy garlic  from Shawarma hot spot is something I absolutely will go out of my way to have when I'm in town.

The late night hours allowed me to grab a meal after a concert at caesars and let me tell you it hit the spot!

It's worth dining in if you have the time.

The staff are friendly and help you out with the ordering process.

10/10 recommended  and I will definitely be back as often as possible"
Shawarma Hot Spot,4,"Ordered Fattoush salad and mozzarella sticks. Both were very good. The prices were fair for good portions of food. For me, if I'm being picky, I'd say the salad dressing had a bit too much vinegar. However, everything was still good."
Shawarma Hot Spot,1,This restaurant only deserves 1/5 because of the fries that were barely okay. The gyro is the most bland thing I‚Äôve ever ate. How do you even have bland tzatziki??? The rice was beyond dry and the chicken is so hard you can‚Äôt even bite into it
Shawarma Hot Spot,5,"Best shawarma, period.

Seriously the best shawarma I‚Äôve ever had in my life. I live in Texas and every year I come to Windsor to visit family and am sure to stop here. This is better than anything I‚Äôve had in US, Canada, and Middle East. The ingredients are fresh, chicken has tons of flavor and toasted bread is unbeatable. Owner is very friendly and has been running this spot for 22 years now."
Shawarma Hot Spot,4,"Pros.

Best shawarma place in windsor.
Large portions
Amazing garlic sauce .
Friendly services.

Cons .

Interior is dated and could use an update, however it doesn't effect the food.

It took me forever to find the best Shawarma in town. Now I'm obsessed."
The Harvest Table Restaurant,3,"This is definitely the spot we always come to when we have that craving for fish and chips ..... Unfortunately this time it was very disappointing. The fries were overcooked..... But most importantly, the fish while cooked properly, the batter/coating have DEFINITELY CHANGED !!! and not for the better. I came in on my cheat day for one of my favorite meals, but it felt like something completely different than the delicious norm. Our server was fabulous as always .... I did indeed tell her my disappointment. She offered to get me new fries but I declined ... And told me that the coating for the fish was different now.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get the original
back."
The Harvest Table Restaurant,4,AAA steak sandwich cooked to a perfect medrare topped with 2 over easy eggs.  With side sweet potatoe fries.  The coffee was yum for breakfast place.  The debit machine crashed I don't normally carry cash but I did that day thank goodness.  Waitress was excellent.
The Harvest Table Restaurant,1,"We were sat,  we waited for a while. Waitresses walked past us multiple times we were clearly ready to order and they proceeded to sweep couldn‚Äôt acknowledge us. We got fed up and left and no one cared. It was not very busy and we came In at 1 it‚Äôs not like we were jerks who came in at close demanding service. Never again."
The Harvest Table Restaurant,5,"I would be more than willing to say this place is pretty awesome. They have a delicious coffee and their food is just delicious to look at, let alone eat! Thanks harvest table for filling my belly."
The Harvest Table Restaurant,5,Delicious breakfast and good portions at a reasonable price. Service was nice to and I really enjoyed my visit here. I would definitely go again.
The Original Pizza Plus,4,One of the best conveyer belt oven pizza in the Windsor region. Family owned and operated. They always have specials for less compare to other Windsor pizza joints. They use quality ingredients. We have been ordering their pizza for many years and never disappointed. All the meats they have are Halal and there is no cross contamination with non halal meats. I picked up 4 large pizzas today for $65 and they were cooked perfectly.
The Original Pizza Plus,4,"Quick stop for some pizza,chicken, and wedges. Fair prices."
The Original Pizza Plus,5,"One of my favorite pizza places. Their large two topping pizza was my go to more frequently than I should admit. Just delicious, great consistency, made quickly, friendly service.

I moved a few years ago and I still miss this pizza."
The Original Pizza Plus,5,I love chicken wings and I love them extra crispy. PIZZA PLUS is honestly 10 out of 10! Super fast service and very professional. I only order from them! #1 A+
The Original Pizza Plus,5,One of the best pizzas I tasted in Windsor. Open late nights! Bro They even have 7.99 L pizzas walk in specials on Wednesdays.
Qdoba  (650 Division Rd),5,"Amazing dine in experience-Came in with my family and the staff was really accommodating and understanding. Janill the assistant supervisor was really nice and made sure that we got everything by we needed even after paying. Tell him hi if you see him.
If you are an indian you will like it.
Enjoy!!"
Qdoba  (650 Division Rd),1,"both service & quality went downhill.
we waited 25 minutes in line. they most definitely prioritize online orders. ordered quac and I got a teaspoon amount; the person ahead of me got two scoops. was told I can‚Äôt customize a signature burrito bowl even though I have dietary restrictions ? just very unfortunate this used to be my go to place for a burrito bowl .
two big thumbs down"
Qdoba  (650 Division Rd),4,"Enjoyed this new locale for Mexican! The team were happy and supportive to each other as they served a long line of people! Great location , lots of good shops nearby. Fresh, vibrant and clean! Washrooms are well looked after! Enjoy!"
Qdoba  (650 Division Rd),5,"I prefer vegetarian so review is based on my vegetarian meals experience. Their impossible meat is excellent compared to Quesada beyond meat. Most loved meal for me is Burrito bowl with impossible meat, guacamole, cilantro lime sauce, roasted veggies and pickled onions made with medium spicy sauce. You can also try mac and cheese. Pricings are little on upper side but worth for what you pay."
Qdoba  (650 Division Rd),5,"Amazing atmosphere
Friendly, helpful & upbeat staff
This was our first time and it is very similar to chipotle.
Food was awesome, especially the pulled pork!
Also the guacamole IS FREE!!"
Etta's Greeklish Eatery,5,Great breakfast with good portions. Love the food and the service. Owner came out and said hai to everyone.
Etta's Greeklish Eatery,5,"A really cute place with excellent food and staff that are extra kind and friendly.
This is a place best visited with a smaller group or 1-2 people as there really isn't alot of room. But it is a cozy place worth visiting if you are in the area.
The plates are HUGE and the servings are made to fill them, but the tables themselves don't have enough surface area to accommodate too many of these massive plates at once.
I was also a little concerned with the chair I sat in.. üòÖ it felt like it might break  with how much it was creaking, although I am a little overweight so it might have been a fluke.
Still enjoyed my meal, and had a good time with my family. An overall pleasant experience."
Etta's Greeklish Eatery,5,"What a quaint,cozy restaurant.
The food was outstanding,  large portions and quite frankly,  the best Greek food that I've ever had.
One small suggestion,  it would be nice to have music playing in the dining room."
Etta's Greeklish Eatery,5,"Ok, this food is phenomenal! It's definitely a gem, hole in the wall with great food and service. Not fancy at all but I will be back over and over. Go try this place, you will not be disappointed."
Etta's Greeklish Eatery,1,"We ate here about 3 years ago and it was pretty good. We had it again tonight and it was terrible. I sent the lemon chicken rice soup back. Tasted like chemicals and had nothing in it. No chicken or rice. The food itself was just bland, the chicken souvlaki looked and tasted like it was boiled rather than grilled. No flavour, the rice was the best part. The potatoes were bland. It was supposed to come with veggies but there was none. The Greek salad had hardly any lettuce. My wife had the chicken shawarma and said it was meh. I won't be back."
Mucho Burrito (3100 Howard Avenue),1,"Worst burrito place in terms of customer service and food portion. Unwelcoming, unprofessional customer service. I ordered two regular burrito around 12:40 yesterday and got small portion . Also got whole wheat instead of white tortilla. I asked the girl to change the tortilla and she just moved all food from one tortilla to other, did not even add some extra sauce. Barely got chicken."
Mucho Burrito (3100 Howard Avenue),5,It was a good a good experience and food was good too. Love the food.
Mucho Burrito (3100 Howard Avenue),5,"Karan is giving great service here.
Loved their Veggie Mucho Burrito."
Mucho Burrito (3100 Howard Avenue),5,Good food. Friendly staff
Mucho Burrito (3100 Howard Avenue),5,I eat here everyday literally this is the healthiest food in the mall I‚Äôm not over exaggerating this is very fresh and good and they are not stingy with the bowl this fills me up for at least 4 hrs I love this place thank you and the person that made my bowl his name is Karan
Naija Foodeats,1,ABSOLUTELY DO NOT EAT HERE! the food is AWFUL. The rice SMELLED like smoke and tasted disgusting. I couldn‚Äôt even take one bite. It was truly the worst meal I have ever had. I had to throw the whole thing away. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!! The smell and taste of the food was so startling I can‚Äôt believe they served it.
Naija Foodeats,1,"I usually do not give bad review but the food is really really bad, especially the ofada was BAD, it was tasting bitter, too oily, no meat.. I was promised assorted meat but was given chicken back, and the green pepper was not chopped properly (As you can see in the first and second picture the green pepper looked like a sort of meat), DO NOT BUY FROM THEM SAVE YOUR MONEY PERIOD!!! thank me later. THIS FOOD IS NOT WORTH $18."
Naija Foodeats,5,"The peppered ponmo, amala, ewedu and gbegiri was amazing. Best I have tasted since I left nigeria. Going for another round when next I come back to Windsor."
Naija Foodeats,5,"it smells so amazong when you walk in here this place is a must try, I ended up coming a little late for my order and there customer service is remarkable they go above and beyond"
Naija Foodeats,5,"I recommend the jollof, the moi moi and the suya. The owner is very welcoming, the space is enjoyable, the restaurant is bright and beautiful and the food is the best african food in town."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (4328 Walker Road),5,"Most of the time are the little things that makes the difference. I haven't been to Cora's in a long time: pandemic, family life and so on. This morning, my husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice Sunday breakfast.  We were greeted right away by the hostess and taken to our table that was clean and ready for us. In a matter of seconds, Emily, our server was there with 2 glasses of water, menus, silverware and a big smile to take our drinks order. The menus at Cora's are full of original item, all of them amazing. I decided on the crepes ""The Boss Favourite"". While we were navigated the menus Emily was back the coffees and and small plate with something covered by napkins. I was super happy to see that there was my favourite: marmalade. All the other breakfast places I have ask for it. The coffee is ths hottest I've ever drank just how I like it. The crepes was delicious.  We had a very nice breakfast, definitely no need for lunch after breakfast at Cora's. Emily came back to refill our cup with hot, stream coffee with need to be asked and always wearing the best smile. Thank you for a great breakfast and not expensive considering the quality and quantity of food and the service."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (4328 Walker Road),5,"My husband and I were in Guelph visiting a friend and she suggested we have breakfast at Cora's on our last day there. I wish we had found it sooner because it was delightful! They ordered the salmon benedict while I took advantage of the gorgeous, fresh fruit they had available (with a little bit of coco-hazelnut spread!). The staff was friendly and didn't hover, the atmosphere was nice and the food was generous and delicious. Would definitely eat here again and I can see why it was so busy!"
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (4328 Walker Road),5,Excellent breakfast and brunch place. I booked this place for a corporate brunch and the employees are super nice. They were kind enough to reserve a spot in advance for us in a corner for our group. Food was absolutely delicious and filling ü§§. I had the churizo and egg skillet. I would definitely recommend this place and you have lots of parking space.
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (4328 Walker Road),5,Such good food and staff is always kind and welcoming! They brought my daughter a cute little apple bird for her birthday.
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (4328 Walker Road),4,I love this place. Big portions & a lot of choices for everyone in your group. Usually a wait at the door ~ 15 min
Chatham Street Diner,5,What an amazing diner. Best breakfast in Windsor. It was within walking distance from our hotel and every single person we asked said to go here. They were 100% right. If you are going to be in Windsor you must eat here.
Chatham Street Diner,5,"Best hashbrown potatoes I've ever had. My husband and I were super pleased with our food here. Delicious and not too expensive. Our waitress was friendly and welcoming. The only downfall was that there wasn't a lot of seating, despite how big the dining area was."
Chatham Street Diner,4,"Okay start with the positive stuff but was some stuff that definitely could have been done better. First impressions customer service was beyond excellent, friendly and helpful and welcoming, prices are amazing, place is clean and friendly environment. Food everything but what I will be talking about (steak and poached eggs) was 10/10. Now reviews are meant to help places know where to improve so yes many things were amazing but this is why 4/5 stars. Ordered steak breakfast combo with a bagel instead and cream cheese, and grilled onions, cheese and shredded onions added to both my combos fries. Neither fries had green onions on them that I paid extra for $1.6 gone, bagel did not come with cream cheese either was pretty disappointed at that. Ordered whipped cream on the sufe for pancakes with both combos didn't receive one. Steak was okay for its price but little flavor was very watery, cooked the way I asked but could have been a lot better. 2 poached eggs I ordered unfortunate to say was the worst poached eggs I've had before, very watery and done poorly. And bacon was very dry and hard. So those things could have been a lot better but, everything else was amazing, I do recommend this place and would go back it just needs some improvements and to not rush things as thats how things are missed or not done well. Overall tho was great food and experience and priced well, made very quickly."
Chatham Street Diner,5,"Ordered for the first time a few nights ago. My first impression was that the menu prices are great. When the food was delivered, packaging was clean and the food was well presented. The eggs Benny was excellent! Eggs perfectly cooked and the hollandaise sauce did not make the bread soggy, even though my food was delivered. The pancakes were the fluffiest I've had in a long time. I definitely recommend ordering. I will be ordering again."
Chatham Street Diner,5,"Amazing food and service!
I had seen the diner had a March special on so decided to try it out. Not only were the portion sizes huge, the food tasted great!
The owner came over and introduced himself and asked how our food tasted. And our server was also very friendly. My children were entertained with the colouring books and crayons available. We will definitely be returning!"
Hurry Curry (Devonshire Mall),1,"Very bad taste of Amritsari kulcha, it‚Äôs like they are using frozen items. The staff is very rude . There is one young boy he is behaving very rude . I asked for some extra curry and I said him that I will also pay extra for this but he replied you have to pay 12$ extra just for 2 more spoons of curry . The experience was very bad over there . They must teach their staff how to behave with customers. It‚Äôs like wastage of money ."
Hurry Curry (Devonshire Mall),4,"I tried their Chole Bhature and Non-veg Thali,
I must say that the food was really tasty.

In Nonveg Thali you can pick two non veg curries of your choice, one veg curry and salad of your choice along with sweet dish , rice and naan.

They have friendly staff, fast service and quite a variety of food to choose from."
Hurry Curry (Devonshire Mall),4,Good food for a good price at the mall. Their non veg thali is a great deal and they have good options. I also love their channa batura!
Hurry Curry (Devonshire Mall),1,"Worst food i have ever had. Its like wasting money here. I bought chana bhatura from here, the bhatura‚Äôs were fried in very low quality oil. Still bad essence in my mouth. And chana was overcooked. Overall AWFULL. And the onion-pickle salad was served in the lid of pop."
Hurry Curry (Devonshire Mall),4,"Aloo paratha is decent in taste.
Allo tikkis are good.
I just tried these items. Will try other items for sure in later visits."
McDonald's (Red Deer),5,"It feels like home (Philippines). I love their fries and chicken sandwich, it taste the same in Mcdonald's Philippines. I will definitely come back again and again."
McDonald's (Red Deer),1,Despite being literally the only person at the drive through I had to wait almost 10 minutes to be served. Once my order was finally taken I drove up to the window and waited another five. Was about to give up and drive off when they finally gave me my order. Food was cold and the mcflurry they made me was the wrong flavor. Apparently the staff here just don't care.
McDonald's (Red Deer),1,I had to repeat my order 5 times and still got the wrong one.  My wife's burger was dry and burnt and my sons chicken mcnuggets were dry.  The coke was also flat and ended up being dumped out.  Now I remember why we stopped eating here.
McDonald's (Red Deer),1,"I work here for a year place it‚Äôs so traumatizing to work at so many over doses homeless having fights with us in the store we always have cops there managers are so unfair when it‚Äôs comes to taking you break at a reasonable time instead of an hour before you‚Äôre (usually when they send you) they have zero understanding for calling in sick they make you call the store number and they usually don‚Äôt end up answering I called for three hours this one time, and when they finally answered, they tried to write me up as short notice. Managers are blank, rude when they are telling  you to cover shifts, they are super unorganized and honestly seems like they have zero idea of what there doing I feel bad for the kids there that are getting super under paid and over worked my wishes go to them and as for the kids that are thinking of applying here‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt. the building is so unsafe. In first window the roof is coming apart and there is mold. Kitchen guys don‚Äôt wash their hand I work there for a year and I haven‚Äôt seen one of them wash their hands. Managers are rude espacially Hazel she‚Äôll tell you your ruining her shift/ day if you messed something up. Machines are always broken and I mean always lots of the times we‚Äôll be hand putting in your creamer and sugar because the machine is broken. Overall terrible terrible place def do not bring small children here it‚Äôs UNSAFE."
McDonald's (Red Deer),1,"Terrible night crew. Myself & 6 different cars tried to order food and no one would Anwser drive thru, wouldn‚Äôt pick up the phone, & when they do take your order you‚Äôll get old fries and old nuggets."
Sam Street Food,5,"Me and my friend went to windsor for a swimming competition, and we were finding some nice place for lunch, and then we found the ‚ÄúSam Street Food‚Äù on google, it looks really good on the photos, so we went there and tried their food. The foods are really good, and delicious. We talked to Sam and he is really nice and friendly! We ate the Japanese pancake and the waffles, the Japanese pancake taste exactly the same as the one that i tried in Japan before, and the waffles is really delicious and I love the ice cream on top! I hope we get to do a competition in Windsor again so we get to meet Sam and taste his delicious food again! We highly recommend people to come and try Sam‚Äôs delicious street food! ( This is the best food in the world and I can feel Sam used his heart for the foods! )"
Sam Street Food,5,"Best street food in Windsor!!!ÊúâÂ∞èÊó∂ÂÄôÁöÑÈ∏°ËõãÊ±âÂ†°üò≠ÁÖéÈ•ºÊûúÂ≠êÈáåËøòÊúâËñÑËÑÜÔºåËøòÊúâÊ∏©ËééÊó•ÊñôÂ∫ó‰πü‰∏çÂ§™ÂçñÁöÑÂæ°Â•ΩÁÉßÔºåÂº∫Êé®üò≠

I found this place on Google Maps, and they went the extra mile to come and try it out. It took us half an hour to get there, but it was totally worth it. The Chinese burger here is incredibly delicious and reminds me of the ones I used to have near the school gates back in my childhood days in China. They even use the same griddle for cooking the burgers, just like in China. I never thought I would find that nostalgic taste here in Canada, and it truly touched my heart.

The Korean sandwich is also fantastic, with a generous portion size. I highly recommend trying their authentic Osaka-style Okonomiyaki; it tasted exactly like the ones I had in Japan. I feel incredibly lucky to have found this place.

The owner of the store is very kind and friendly. They shared many stories with us, adding to the overall wonderful experience. I sincerely hope they continue to enjoy a happy life and prosperous business. What I want to say is that every dish they serve aligns perfectly with my taste buds. I will be recommending this place to all my friends, as you deserve more customers. As long as I'm living in Windsor, I will definitely come back here lots of times."
Sam Street Food,5,"Sam brings something really special to the Windsor food scene. His food is creative, full of heart and a reflection of his experience as an engineer. His menu is inspired by his Syrian culture and his wife's Chinese culture. I had the Chinese egg Crepe wrap and it was unlike anything i have ever had before. Lots of crispy veg inside an egg-covered crepe with a couple of seasoned chicken  patties. So yummy! I watched the Okonomiyaki being prepared... A lot of steps! Don't distract Sam too much, like i did, because everything he makes is prepared fresh and takes a little time. Be patient... It's worth it. Can't wait til the next time i return to Windsor - that Okonomiyaki is calling me, next! I should mention it's inside the City Market which i didn't even know existed. A great discovery."
Sam Street Food,5,"Me and my friend came to Windsor for a competition and went to go out and eat some food and we stumbled apon Sams Street Food, This was truly one of the best food we‚Äôve ever had, and will think about it forever. The customer service was lovely and we enjoyed every moment while talking with Sam! The food was amazing with great taste and filled us up, I would DEFINITELY recommend trying this while in Windsor. (Hopefully we will have another competition in Windsor so we can eat here again!!)"
Sam Street Food,5,"I had heard of Okonomiyaki from an anime, and thought it sounded pretty good.  Years later, I see this place come up, and that they sell it!  So this morning, for my birthday lunch, I set out to order some Hiroshima Okonomiyaki.

I cannot understate how delightful this is to eat.

I must, but do not want to, wait for another day to try more items, because if they're even half as good they'd still be well worth it.

The guy running it is super nice, and it's clear he knows what he's doing since this is now easily one of my faves.  Very memorable, will be back."
The Patio Lounge - Windsor,1,Ordered on uber for lunch. I ordered a rach chicken club wrap with the fries. It came both wrapped in tinfoil but the fries were not wrapped properly and fell everywhere in the bag. It was also soggy and burnt. It almost looked like they gave me scraps they didn't want to use because they weren't even coherently cut in the same size. The wrap was just soggy from the sauce that was everywhere. Disgusting. Never again
The Patio Lounge - Windsor,1,I placed an Uber eats order tonight that was accepted by the restaurant. Then 40 minutes later I get a message from the delivery driver that their kitchen closed at 7pm and they couldn't make my order.  I placed the order at 7:40 so I'm unsure why the restaurant accepted it if they knew the kitchen was closed.  On Uber it says they stop taking orders at 8pm. I am annoyed that the order was never canceled by the restaurant knowing they couldn't fulfill it. Even after the delivery driver contacted me they didn't cancel the order.  I tried calling the restaurant and it went straight to a full voice-mail. About 10 minutes later I contacted the restaurant online and finally got the order canceled so I wouldn't be charged.
The Patio Lounge - Windsor,1,"Clubhouse had bacon bits, wilted shredded lettuce and dried cubes of chicken on it.
One toonie size slice of tomato and a mini squirt of what I think was mayonnaise. We did get a refund but it‚Äôs still very disappointing. They acknowledged the bacon bits and said it was all they had. No reason for the hard chicken cubes. Nacho supreme was missing 5 out if the 7 ordered toppings. Never ever again."
The Patio Lounge - Windsor,1,"First time ordering from here got my order delivered, I had a bacon cheeseburger with extra bacon, onion ring, and a clubhouse. When I got my order I had no bacon or cheese on the cheeseburger , on the clubhouse I had no sauce or chicken! Went back to get my order remade came home and my order was so wrong and gross! Horrible customer service this time my clubhouse was on whole white instead of white , there was so much mayonnaise it was dripping out of my sandwich! The cheeseburger is just plan disgusting!!! I will never order from them again"
The Patio Lounge - Windsor,1,"Absolute worst food I‚Äôve had since moving to Windsor, which is saying something since I‚Äôm a broke college student who has made some questionable life choices. The food tasted like it was cooked in a dirty dishwasher; soaking wet, greasy and not even what I ordered. If you hate yourself, then sure go ahead and order but if you have any self respect I would highly suggest you pass on this dumpster fire of an establishment."
Little Foot Foods,5,"Had lunch here today for the 1st time and picked up a wide Variety of different perogies to cook at home.  Absolutely phenomenal, not only is the food incredible but the staff is extremely welcoming and kind. 10/10, hands down the best perogies I've ever had, I will most definitely be recommending this place to everyone. Incredible üôÇ"
Little Foot Foods,5,"Delicious food, home cooked. My kids always eat anything from them. The pierogi take 8 minutes to cook! Who doesn't want that when feeding 5 kids! Lol
Love that they have so many other local products in their shop as well!!"
Little Foot Foods,5,"Been buying from these absolute rockstars almost every week for like 3 years now, so this review is WAY overdue. You cannot go wrong here, I've never been disappointed in anything from the range of 30ish pierogi types I've tried, to the delicious mac and cheese and chocolate chip cookies, to the cabbage rolls! Which says something because I've always hated them until I tried theirs! Little Foot Foods simply puts out quality products and their shop always has a great variety of local goodness, as they truly walk the ""Support Local"" talk. They're absolutely one of my favorite businesses, and people, in YQG and I cannot recommend them more!"
Little Foot Foods,5,The best pierog around. No doubt about it. The Roulette Pack is such a fun eating experience but breakfast pierogi will change your life!
Little Foot Foods,5,What a great place good food friendly people and wow does it smell good in there. Cabbage rolls perogies and more. So much to try. They bend over backwards to please. If there were 10 stars they'd be worth it
Ace convenience,3,"It took about 25 minutes before a server acknowledged me. When my cheeseburger arrived, it had bacon on it. I don't eat ""pork at all"", the server offered to take it back to the kitchen and have the pork removed; I said I needed a fresh burger. I got my burger, and it was corrected. The server was gracious and said he was sorry for the mix-up and took my coke off my bill. I understand the employees are working through their life challenges and are doing their best to serve customers. It was Canada Day, and it was both a busy and very hot day. I'll go back on a less busy day."
Ace convenience,5,"Very friendly, professional service. Excellent prices and excellent food. Will be going back again took my friends from Florida for breakfast and they truly enjoyed it."
Ace convenience,4,"Food is plenty. Staff is quite attentive. This place has a relaxed, casual vibe."
Ace convenience,5,"Excellent breakfast food, incredibly attentive service, tax free, all in support of a good cause. Highly recommend."
Ace convenience,5,My experience here is outstanding.  Food is excellent and customer service is excellent.  They go about the bar to make sure you are happy.  Very very friendly too. Great job guys!! Keep up your hard work!!
Bally's Kitchen,5,"Excellent food, great service. The fresh summer rolls were authentic tasting and fresh. Really good food. Will come back - very close to Windsor hospital, so handy for visitors."
Bally's Kitchen,4,"Pad Thai - not bad but a bit saucy for my liking; also, does not have any hint of spice (mavbe to cater non-South East Asian customers who aren't fond of spicy dishes);
Grilled porkchop - perfectly grilled, nice smoky flavour;
Grilled skewered shrimps on mango salad - I like the mango salad; the shrimps are bland.
Also, from a previous dine in:
Iced tea - love that it tastes more tea than sweet, very balanced and authentic Thai Tea;
Mango salad - loved it."
Bally's Kitchen,4,"We went for lunch last week and really enjoyed it. Had the crispy rolls for an appetizer and a few different Pho. The broth was light and delicious and the meat was perfect. One of us also had the Chow Mein which was very saucy and flavorful.
We will be back!"
Bally's Kitchen,5,"Good friendly service, and amazing food. I had the best char kway teow I‚Äôve had in Canada. This restaurant will live in my day dreams. I live hours away but I will definitely be back. 10/10!!!!!!!"
Bally's Kitchen,5,Very flavourful. Beef was a bit tough. I still enjoyed it though. Will definitely be back. This time I ordered the beef pho and sizzking beef with jasmine rice. Delish.
Minh Hang Sandwich Shop,5,"oh my gosh!! this place was unbelievably cheap and delicious. we ordered 2 banh mi's, 1 egg and 1 meatball, 1 kiwi soda, 1 pineapple soda, 2 fresh shrimp and pork rolls, chicken sticky rice and an order of grilled chicken spring rolls.

everything was fresh and sooo good. we definitely have some left over for dinner lol. the place was super close to our house too. the atmosphere in the restaurant was inviting, super cute and friendly. only wish they had more seating! will be coming back to try the rest of the sandwiches!"
Minh Hang Sandwich Shop,5,"What a  wonderful place! We tried the tofu, grilled pork and shredded ckn bahn mi sandwiches, fried egg fresh rolls and the house made rose soda and mango soda. They make tofu in house and all sauces and they are marvelous.
Also there was a baby helping mom behind the counter and she was as cute as a button"
Minh Hang Sandwich Shop,5,"Yummy Vietnamese bread and fried tofu, especially sweet tofu desert with coconut cream. Owner was nice and friendly. Definitely recommended to try the only Vietnamese subway style in Windsor."
Minh Hang Sandwich Shop,5,Basically down the street from my house which is awesome and I love Viet food so I thought I'd try it out got 2 pork sandwiches and fresh rolls! For me and my uncle REALLY GOOD food and amazing prices definitely get a bang for your buck! I will be going back especially for Lunch time! Not sure how it got a bad review before because that was far from my experience
Minh Hang Sandwich Shop,5,"We really enjoyed lunch today Minh Hang! I had to believe that all the many great reviews couldn't be wrong. The service was wonderful and pleasant, the atmosphere, although small is nice and the excellent, well priced food will have us returning again and again!"
Subway (247 Kennedy St),1,I was forced to wait 20 minutes for the bathroom by the staff who wanted to help a line of customers before they chose to open the door for me. Kinda seems too stupid to be true but it is lol
Subway (247 Kennedy St),1,It has no public washroom even after buying food I felt racial profiled...belong First Nation üòï
Subway (247 Kennedy St),2,"Normally always love this Subway, especially when the owners are there, they are great! Which makes it such a diff when they aren‚Äôt there. The 2 girls today, not great at all! Not helpful, not friendly. And it wasn‚Äôt  busy, so no excuse."
Subway (247 Kennedy St),1,"The girl who was working today got my hole order wrong an made a big deal about changing it cause she new we wouldn't say change it....seems like she has been doing that for along time, pretending she didn't hear what you said.
An a guy was sitting there waiting for his order an she sent him away.
It's not even worth calling cause they won't do anything about it! I'm sure is a waste of time but just be aware of this location!"
Subway (247 Kennedy St),1,"I am here right now‚Ä¶.rude staff, the return spring is slamming the door on people, the tables are filthy (not wiped for hours or days by the look of dried mayo), there is a sign up that says coffee all day but there is no coffee available, the drink cooler is nearly empty. There are two customers in the restaurant in the last 10 minutes and the two staff have done nothing but stand and chat the entire time. Walk to another location if you are looking for lunch."
McDonald's (City Place),4,"I recently went to McDonald‚Äôs and had their Big Mac burger with vegetarian patty. The burger was nice. The French fries were bit soggy. We also had McChicken burger.
Recently tried their donuts and shamrock and chocolate shake"
McDonald's (City Place),5,"The morning ladies at this location are wonderful! Always great service. I go once or twice a week before work, and I'm always met with smiles and told to have a nice day. My orders are always made promptly and correctly with my add ons. I appreciate you and your friendliness at the beginning of my day. Thank you!"
McDonald's (City Place),1,"Got a chocsicle üêÆüç¶üç®üêÇüëéwhen ordered a large coffee, and what was suppose to be chocolate milk on my way to work. Why give a customer frozen milk. Absolute horrible service ."
McDonald's (City Place),2,"I used to go to this location more than I‚Äôd like to admit but it started to become a waste of money. Prices have gone up everywhere yet the food and evening drive thru service here are getting worse.

Not sure if it‚Äôs the speaker system or a problem with multi tasking but there‚Äôs usually miss-communication and a need to pay again for missed items. Most times you don‚Äôt get a receipt or you have to ask for it. If something is missing, there‚Äôs no real option to make it right once you‚Äôre home. Even if a manager writes it down for pick up at a later date, the workers won‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.

The burgers are more steamed and less grilled now I think and turned out to be grey, moist pieces of meat. The nuggets are usually dried out and fries are a hit and miss, leaning towards undercooked/oily.

I‚Äôm okay paying for extra sauces (McDonald‚Äôs always gets their money), but they usually don‚Äôt make it into the bag. If you notice after leaving drive thru and sometimes right at the window, they‚Äôll expect you to pay for more if you don‚Äôt hold firm. I‚Äôve had a worker get huffy about it more than a few times. You can empty the bags in front of the sauce police and they still assume you‚Äôre trying to get 2 free sauces.

Sometimes the manager is great though. If they‚Äôre around to take your order and leading the crew, it‚Äôll be the best and fastest service you‚Äôll receive there."
McDonald's (City Place),2,"Drink machine was broken so my soda was warm, nuggets were obviously old and none of the employees were in proper uniform, or using hair nets. Ppl were at the till waiting to be served while the employees were chatting up a storm with their music blasting. I'm not a kill joy but I'm pretty sure doing your job isn't unreasonable to ask for."
A&W (PC Pembina Hwy),1,"Used to just order coffee with cream. They Out of this, out of this out of that they don't tell you instead substitute it with skim milk, something i did not ask for. Cannot even get coffee right. Coffee Tasted toxic that day as if they just topped old coffee with unchanged filter was terrible first thing in the morning, tasted toxic much like the voices of tongue judging each patron to walk in while being ridiculed. The Washrooms here are locked where you have to be escorted and wait for permission by the key controller (locks automatically) maybe the staff here are treated inhumanely?? Possibly overworked? Why do the staff here treat customers or deli drivers like a dirty number. Very disingenuous. What's next a hole in the ground for the Washrooms? I don't expect that in Canada.
Be nice Canadians work hard for their money everything is costly rising, your lack of love reflects the quality of your product!"
A&W (PC Pembina Hwy),1,These people put the A&W name to shame. Not only do they serve flat coke but their customer service is awful. Not sure if the girl that works behind the A&W counter is racist or what but she definitely had something against me.
A&W (PC Pembina Hwy),5,I ordered my beyond meat burger because I am vegetarian. Premjeet was preparing my food. He cleaned the grill and served me the best burger. The service time and the behavior was very good. I highly everyone recommend to visit this location and try delicious and clean food.
A&W (PC Pembina Hwy),1,"Do not buy food here, they do not wash their hands after touching money and register, and they will throw your change at you instead of handing it to you, when confronted i was told i was being mean and rude. I would not buy any food here and just go to the real a n w across the road."
A&W (PC Pembina Hwy),3,"They're clearly understaffed and very slow, but there were signs up looking for workers so obviously the management knows it's an issue and is working on it.

Probably not their fault since they're connected to the gas station - but there were flies buzzing around the countertop which was pretty unappealing.

They were out of the burger I wanted, even though it was still up on the sign and there was nothing additional to indicate they were out.

Hard to screw up root beer though - it was the same as always."
Taco Bell (750 Sherbrook St),3,"Usually it's okay, but sometimes the wait times are just absolutely ridiculous. They're always so focused on all the skip orders. They kind just forget about everyone else, and then everyone else ends up with cold crusty food that's been sitting there while they make the skip meals. Been a couple times I've had to Karen and go up asking where my stuff is. Last time I went I waited 30 mins for a small order. Just annoying."
Taco Bell (750 Sherbrook St),1,We ordered the taco party pack and it was nasty dripping grease and soggy they have no pride in there food or there washrooms so filthy couldn't believe it never again I'll go there
Taco Bell (750 Sherbrook St),3,"We happened to arrive as the restaurant was being awarded for their excellence. I was happy for the staff to be able to participate in this. It was the CLEANEST  I have ever seen this restaurant! Lol I like the new decor as well. Food was good, ordered the Chalupas. There was no ice in the drink machine but they were happy to fill my cup when I asked."
Taco Bell (750 Sherbrook St),4,"Food was good. I tried the new spicy Taco box. 3 Taco's with 3 different spicy sauce. I enjoy all three and could actually taste the difference between them. A lot of places you go to the sauce all tastes the same. The box came with the 3 Taco's, a drink, cinnamon crisps and fries. Not sure why they include regular fries in a Taco box but so be it. Only issue I had was waiting to be served. (Long enough for my wife use to the restroom, which she said needed cleaning, and find a seat) Probably 10 minutes or a little longer. There was 3-4 ladies working and it appeared they were taking care of the drive thru while the line behind me grew (I was first inline at the counter) Once they took my order it was only 5 minutes or so and my order was ready. Other than the wait time to place my order, the overall visit was good."
Taco Bell (750 Sherbrook St),1,"The restaurant was empty yet we had a long wait for a small order. I was overcharged by $2.20, when I asked for the money back I received $2.00. Every taco ordered had barely anything inside. I was missing sour cream and another person was missing tacos. The food quality was below average and not filling.
Will not be back to this location!"
Burger King (1033 Notre Dame Ave),1,My wife and I got our breakfast at the drive-thru. We order 2 english muffin combos. The sausage sandwiches looked like they were under the light for more than 30 mins. The taters luke warn. I do not understand that on a sunday morning is not even busy and they still pre-prep the food before its being order. I have been at this location before and never had a problem with my food. Next time I will dine-in and ask to be made fresh. If I ever comeback.
Burger King (1033 Notre Dame Ave),5,"I'm a picky eater.  I ordered at the drive through. What I asked for, I received it perfectly!!! After I finished my meal in my car, I took the time to go inside and asked for the girl who made it and personally thanked her for a job well done!!!! I noticed also their was only her cooking, 1 grabbing the orders and 1 taking the orders. This was at night yet. Way to go ladies, keep up the great work!!!!!"
Burger King (1033 Notre Dame Ave),2,"I had coupons and went there three times recently. I ordered the whopper with cheese. All three times the bun was overwhelming the burger, I ended up taking the top off to eat it open face. The burger itself was fine but to truly enjoy the meat I would order a double because the patties are not sufficient enough. Also never order the breaded chicken sandwich, it's incredible salty, I through mine out, yeck."
Burger King (1033 Notre Dame Ave),1,On the drive thru I asked for cheesy jalape√±o bites for my meal like a add on and guess what I just got home and checked everything these people asked me 3times what I wanted and still didn‚Äôt get it right! My family had to pay me back for what I spended here BECAUSE they knew THIS place does not care about their customers they charged me for something I didn‚Äôt even get
Burger King (1033 Notre Dame Ave),1,"in my order did not put cherry coke and hersheys sundae pie, instead of jalapeno cheesy bites they put me Mozzarella Sticks, did not put extra cheese in the burger.terrible establishment, I will not order more from them"
Quiznos (Kenaston),5,"It never disappoints me when it comes to my favorite classic club. The lobster sea food is so yummy!
The staff is also supportive and that guy preparing food was so nice when explaining new lobster sub."
Quiznos (Kenaston),5,"Never had anything but great experiences at this location. Staff are friendly, professional, and get subs made quickly and to order. Bathrooms are always spotless. Almost every time I've came in I've seen the manager(?), who is always visible and making sure everything is clean and running smoothly. Not often you see that at chain restaurants like this. I will continue to stop at this location when I am in the area!"
Quiznos (Kenaston),5,"I just had the best sub I've ever had in my life. I tried the Lobster Seafood club sub. It was fantastic! I didn't really add anything else to it
other than a few raw white onions, green peppers and a few black olives. It was so tasty and so light...and just such a good tasting sandwich. I will definitely get it again.  Also to mention that the manager that served me she was so patient and kind with me.  I've never been here before and she was really friendly and awesome service with a smile. 5/5"
Quiznos (Kenaston),5,"This is by far the BEST Quiznos. Period! Kamal (staff member) makes the greatest food you will ever taste, leaving you coming back for more. She never frowns and ALWAYS makes sure you're satisfied with your order- although you'd never not be at this location. If you're hungry and like good food, it's worth the trip especially if Kamal is working!"
Quiznos (Kenaston),2,"New management just over and there has been an immediate drop in quality. Also, they want to nickel and dime you for side peppers and stuff now. Won‚Äôt be returning."
Kenaston Wine Market,4,"Went for a simple dinner out, and overall was satisfied.  Food was tasty and quick to be delivered.  Server was not as energetic as we have had in the past.  Maybe just having an off day.  Otherwise would recommend for a casual dinner out."
Kenaston Wine Market,3,"Not what we were expecting. I've been here lots of times, previous one prior to the pandemic. Burgers were great, including side dishes.
This time our burgers (the original) were just ok. Fries, both potato and sweet potato, were reheated. Salad was very good.
It will be a long time when and if I return. A shame"
Kenaston Wine Market,4,"Awesome experience. Good service, friendly hosts and nice ambience"
Kenaston Wine Market,4,"Great spot with friendly staff. It‚Äôs changed over the years as things do but it‚Äôs an easy lunch spot or game night location to watch hockey or football. Located off kenaston, the patio can be loud in the summer but then winnipeg is a patio City and we love the sun - so it‚Äôs still worth it. I had the California Cobb salad and it was filling and good, the wings and nachos are pretty decent.  Overall a solid location to head to!"
Kenaston Wine Market,4,"Mostly OK. My wife's steak and fries were cold, so they compensated us well for the cook's error.
Justin, the manager came and talked to us about the problem. Serving staff were also very nice.
All and all a good place to eat and or have a drink.
Thanks Justin."
Mr. Sub (2305 McPhillips Street),1,"I usually like going here but today was absolutely awful being just my wife and I in line we we're rushed through
Customer service was absolutely awful. Both girls argued with my wife about a concern my wife brought up to them...she never got to get everything on her wrap before she started man handling it because they just simply weren't interested in asking if there was anything else she wanted added.
When we went to get drinks the young girl SLAMMED the drink on the tray and while paying for the order the two workers went on to talk with one another to avoid what was a very angry look on wifes face.
I don't think we'll be going back sad to see customers are treated like an inconvenience to their day"
Mr. Sub (2305 McPhillips Street),4,"This is hands down my favourite place to eat out, whenever I get the chance I always go to Mr. sub. I‚Äôve been going to Mr. sub since I can remember, my family loves this place also so we always try to get it when we can. They always ave fresh veggies and the breads are amazing! I‚Äôve never had a bad sub from there until today ):

whoever was working there today did not listen to my order correctly and gave me tomatoes that looked extremely mushy and brown‚Ä¶. She put so much salt on my sub when I asked for pepper‚Ä¶ the bread tasted old, the lettuce was brown, overall I was not happy with the Sub I got today. This is the only time in years something like this has happened to me there."
Mr. Sub (2305 McPhillips Street),1,Offers a keto bun.  Yay..but you have to pay an extra 3.00 for a six inch bun which looks more like 5 inches and only get the six inch filling.  Save the 3.00 buy a twelve inch. Throw the bun away and end up with more for less.  Never going there again
Mr. Sub (2305 McPhillips Street),5,Mr Sub was great the staff was super nice and the sandwiches tasted amazing definitely go to come back and eat here regularly! Much better the subway
Mr. Sub (2305 McPhillips Street),5,"Absolutely delicious. The ingredients are always fresh, the bread is super soft and they are pretty generous with the amount of meat. Owner and staff are always super friendly as well."
Marcello's Market and Deli,4,"A first visit to this second location of Marcello‚Äôs Market and Deli. Just enjoyed a cappuccino but did not disappoint. Staff were very friendly and efficient. Everything looked neat, tidy and clean!  Lunch here will be in my future."
Marcello's Market and Deli,4,Lots of things here. The sandwiches are great value. The buffet style is varied and changes a bit everyday. It is nice being able to pick exactly what you want but it's hard to say that it is good value as it is based on the weight of your box. Overall solid lunch place if you want a diverse selection
Marcello's Market and Deli,4,"Marcello's is a decent place for lunch, nothing fancy but that's not a bad thing. They've got this buffet style where you pick what you want and pay by weight. The selection is somewhat varied, but it doesn't change so if you've been there once you already know what's on offer. Still, it does help speed things up since you can just pick what you always get in the quantities you always get and know roughly how much you'll be paying.

It's a good place for lunch and its position right in front of the elevators is ideal for a quick in and out food stop."
Marcello's Market and Deli,1,WAY too expensive. I got 3 meatballs and 2 scoops of rice. It was over $8. I should've went to McDonald's.
Marcello's Market and Deli,4,Great spot to get something quick for lunch. Staff are very friendly and very reasonably priced.
The Farmer's Cuisine,5,"I recently had the pleasure of trying the noodle burger at Farmers Cuisine, and it was truly an amazing experience! As someone who had never tried a noodle burger before, I was pleasantly surprised by the combination of flavors and textures. The spice aroma in the noodles was superb, adding an extra kick to the dish. The fries were perfectly crisp, and it was evident that the food was prepared using fresh ingredients.
The spring rolls were delightfully crispy, and the stuffed noodles inside were cooked to perfection. Overall, I absolutely loved my meal at this restaurant and would highly recommend it. Farmers Cuisine has definitely won me over with their delicious and unique offerings! Must try in Winnipeg!!!!!"
The Farmer's Cuisine,1,"Ordered 12 samosas, waited 25 minutes which wasn‚Äôt a problem.  So far 3  were not cooked , raw dough"
The Farmer's Cuisine,5,"As a gori kudi let me say I've had Indian food all over Winnipeg , as I also recently moved back from Brampton this place is amazing it's my favorite of all in winnipeg and they have real saag ."
The Farmer's Cuisine,4,Food is awesome! Very fresh and served hot!
The Farmer's Cuisine,1,"Poor dine in experience. There was only one person serving all the tables even when it got really busy. And food...we ordered pav bhaji and malai soya chaap, the breads were stale...they had a weird smell and soya chaap worst dish I ever had.
Normally I take out very often and I always order noodle burger which never disappointed me and tonight this is honestly not the experience I was looking for :("
Tim Hortons (646 Archibald Street),1,"I just recently went to this store. First of all the front of the house seems rude. I order peach quencher and the taste wasn‚Äôt expected like she just don‚Äôt wanna do it. If its rating is minus I should have given -10000 to customer service. Moreover, she doesn‚Äôt even close the lid of the drink properly which leads to half of the drink on my clothes. Truly disappointed with the service.

Thanks"
Tim Hortons (646 Archibald Street),1,"The coffee tastes burnt, but most people drink it with so much cream and sugar, they don't know what coffee is supposed to taste like.

I generally come here for the donuts because I can take them to work for colleagues without breaking the bank. Otherwise I can't recommend Tim's."
Tim Hortons (646 Archibald Street),3,HAD THE Best Carmel iced coffee with extra Carmel April 15th here the best Carmel iced coffee I have ever had went again today for one and was disappointed I know it depends who makes it but I wish everyone knew the exact measurements and such because I be craving a good iced cofeee
Tim Hortons (646 Archibald Street),5,"Well worth it. Great service and very friendly. Went by this evening but only wanted crullers. They didn‚Äôt have any BUT offered to make them fresh if I waited 5 minutes, so unexpected and so nice."
Tim Hortons (646 Archibald Street),2,"Went to grab some donuts this evening for my crew. I'm pretty sure the girl went and baked them right then. Not because of how fresh they were, but because it took 15 minutes in any empty drive thru.... Seems way excessive."
Ben & Florentine - Polo Park,4,"Food is always fresh, lots of menu items to choose from.

Fruit and vegetables are widely spread throughout the menu, making for a very healthy feeling meal.

Any of the avocado toast options are amazing along with the majority of the menu!

Caesar was delicious, same with any smoothies or juices they sell!

Staff was a little slow and the restaurant is somewhat crammed feeling but it‚Äôs worth it!

Meals are around 20$ without a drink."
Ben & Florentine - Polo Park,5,"I recently visited Ben and Florentine for the first time at this location, and it exceeded my expectations. The service was excellent, and the food was delicious.

As it was a busy Sunday, the restaurant was packed, and there was a slight delay in receiving our food. However, the attentive service staff made sure to regularly check on us, refilling our water and coffee promptly.

Ben and Florentine is a great place for a brunch meal, especially for families. The portions are incredibly generous, ensuring you won't leave hungry.

One item that's a must-try is their crepe. It has become a non-negotiable for me every time I visit!

Overall, I highly recommend Ben and Florentine for a fantastic brunch experience. Enjoy their delicious food, friendly service, and a memorable dining experience with your loved ones."
Ben & Florentine - Polo Park,4,First time at this location. Good service good food. Packed on a Sunday so had to wait a bit longer for food to come out. Service always asked us for water and coffee regularly. Great place for a brunch meal and with family.
Ben & Florentine - Polo Park,4,"Had a great meal here the other day. We were looking for a place that wasn‚Äôt the typical breakfast restaurant and this was a great alternative. The menu is quite large with many different options. The food came out fairly quickly despite the restaurant being quite full. The only downside unfortunately was that our waitress basically ignored us after she gave us our food. After giving her plenty of opportunities and multiple times walking past us, I finally had to flag her down to bring us the bill. Overall though it was a good experience."
Ben & Florentine - Polo Park,5,"Delicious food for a reasonable price! The portions are great, you can order small breakfasts or large depending on how hungry you are. The waiters/waitresses are very kind or seem to love there jobs! Definitely would go back!"
Dwarf no Cachette Caf√©,4,"Would love to give this place 5 stars because it's so cute inside, but the karaage don was good, not amazing. I would still go here again though to try other stuff on the menu. They have really cool ideas for drinks. I love the Zelda themed drinks, they were adorable. But there was a mix up when I tried to order the apricot Zelda drink. On the online menu it was red, but when I received it, the drink was blue which caused some confusion, hopefully that gets fixed in their menu. Overall I enjoyed my visit here."
Dwarf no Cachette Caf√©,4,"Great Japanese food in St Boniface with a cute gift shop above.

The menu is extensive with many different Japanese plates to choose from. We had the Green Onion & Sesame Sauce Takoyaki, Spicy Chicken Katsu Yakisoba, and Teriyaki Mayo Karaage Don. The highlight was the spicy chicken katsu, the sauce was excellent and the breading was just the right amount of crispy.

The portion sizes were large and ended up taking enough home another full meal. The prices were affordable, especially given the amount of food. For two people, it would be reasonable to share one appetizer and one main dish.

The staff were very friendly and the food was served impressively fast. The decor is an eclectic mix and the furniture was a bit uncomfortable; however, this was not an issue. We enjoyed taking a walk through the gift shop upstairs after our dinner.

We look forward to returning to Dwarf no Cachette to try more of their menu, including their ramen and okinomoyaki. Based on our first experience, we recommend it!"
Dwarf no Cachette Caf√©,4,"I visited this restaurant by a recommendation for Japanese Izakaya food. There were about 10 of us and was pleasantly surprised that they had room when we showed up at around 6-7pm. I made sure to call beforehand though just in case.

[VIBE]
It's a cute and quirky little restaurant featuring gnomes and dwarf decor arrangements. It was cozy inside and on the top floor, there was a local gift shop. The shop sold cute little knick-knacks from handmade jewelry, pins, to anime buttons and stickers.

[SERVICE]
The service was pretty good for having to deal with all 10 of us and we didn't have to wait too long to get seated. The only downfall was that one of the drinks we ordered didn't quite match up to the description of the menu on their website we ordered from. Some of the food items or specials on the website were not on the menu either but were still available to order.

[FOOD]
What we were intentionally drawn with by choosing to eat at this restaurant were the playful drinks. The Zelda themed drinks were fun and we would have no idea about these drinks if not for checking the website.

Onigiri Combo (Takoyaki) - 3 choices of onigiri which I chose 1.tuna mayo, 2. karage, 3. shrimp tempura and it came with a miso soup and 6 pieces of regular takoyaki. The onigiris were HUGE and I ended up only being able to finish one and taking the rest home to go. The takoyaki came out with floating pieces of the bonito flakes waving in the air, as expected. The miso soup was very rich in flavor and I don't think I ever had sesame in miso soup before.

[DRINKS]
Milkshake Shingen-mochi with Black Sugar Syrup - This drink is very delicious and sweet with the black sugar syrup and chewy mochis.

Master Sword - Cold sake, Calpico, and club soda mix with a master sword iced jelly. The master sword jelly gets floppy pretty quickly when left out too long, so it's best to take the pics quick and then stir the drink with the master sword.

Hearty Elixir - Peach Redbull and red coloring. It's a tangy and pretty refreshing drink for the summer.

Blue Jelly Sake Soda - I found the blue jelly was fun to stir around in my drink, but the blue jelly itself tasted pretty bland and not that great with the sake. It's nice for photos only.

Apple Popping Boba Sake - This was an alright tasting drink and it only made it better with the popping bobas! The light hitting the bobas made the drink look radioactive and was fun to take pics of.

I would go here again just to try their other dishes. Everything looked and sounded so good, we all had trouble choosing what to get!

Dwarf no Cachette Caf√©,5,"Absolute gem of Winnipeg. Quite a varied menu of Japanese dishes anywhere from ramen, don buri, curry rice, yakisoba and the gamut of appetizers. The food portions were on the more plentiful side. The service was so pleasant and the cute decor really enhanced the experience."
Dwarf no Cachette Caf√©,3,"Went here for the first time. The service was good and we really liked the tempura but on our second visit, the shrimp tempura had too much flour.

On a side note, they had big portions of their ramen. The broth was good but it wasn‚Äôt the best in my opinion."
A&W (54-333 St. Mary Ave.),5,"Awesome food, great service, and good  atmosphere. I'd recommend üëåüèº"
A&W (54-333 St. Mary Ave.),2,Manager should do more than check coffee pots in front and maybe help the cashier that has 12 people waiting in line for 15 minutes. The cook was waiting and she had no reason not to help. She just went to the kitchen and stared out from the kitchen. Super slow service at certain times.
A&W (54-333 St. Mary Ave.),5,I had breakfast there last week and asked for over-medium eggs and toast with half the butter.  It was done exactly as I requested.  The whites were not funny at all and the toast wasn't slathered with butter.  It's not often that it gets done right at any restaurant.  Kudos to the cook who was working there last week!
A&W (54-333 St. Mary Ave.),2,"Over priced for the food you receive, a lot of times it ic cool or cold"
A&W (54-333 St. Mary Ave.),5,Cool burgers. I recommend Papa ann Uncle:-)
Freshii (2-1194 Taylor Ave),2,Ordered the tex mex wrap with chicken. This is the only location where the chicken was shredded almost thought it was tuna ?  Like out of a can !  Disgusting! The other locations serve real chicken pieces . So gross . I didnt eat it ! Cheap trying to save money and a fail ! Skip this location
Freshii (2-1194 Taylor Ave),1,"The staff are great. I want to make that clear. But I have literally not once gone in and been able to get what I wanted. They are always sold out of something. And it's always the thing I want. So in answer to the question below of whether I dined in or took out, the answer is neither. I walked right back out empty handed. Yet again. I will not be coming back."
Freshii (2-1194 Taylor Ave),2,"They serve the meat portion partially frozen after 20 seconds in the steamer and call it cooked when it's frozen in the center. After 3 attempts during the same visit, it was resolved. I was told that ""corporate says we're not allowed to cook chicken"".

Next time I'll just get a refund."
Freshii (2-1194 Taylor Ave),5,"Hardest working people you will come across. Although can be very busy during lunch hours, still relatively fast for good tasting food. Come here multiple times a week for awhile now, and I have no complaints for this establishment!"
Freshii (2-1194 Taylor Ave),3,"Decent quality, not bad tasting, it is fresh. Don't have their rice noodles. Went today and it was buy one get one. Was definitely over charged. Either that or Buy one get one is not buy one get one. For  your free one if you want protein you pay for that. Even if you added protein to your first one. If you paid for an item with meat it is one item Your next item should be free up to equal or lesser value. This was definitely not the case today. Well at least I didn't tip this time."
IHOP (455 Sterling Lyon Parkway),5,"So, after a full day of couch hunting, we decided to refuel at IHOP. Gotta say, the portions were huge and the food was on point. But holy moly, those pancakes were downright glorious! And let's not forget about Jason, our server. They‚Äôre awesome and really made our experience unforgettable."
IHOP (455 Sterling Lyon Parkway),3,"Short wait to be seated. Served a bad strawberry with the crepes, server never came back after serving the food until she brought the bill. Told her about the bad strawberry and it didn't seem to fizz her. No tip left due to her attitude."
IHOP (455 Sterling Lyon Parkway),2,"First time dining at Ihop.  Service was excellent, food quantity not so much.  The menu stated 2 pieces of ham, they forgot to mention it was two bites of ham.  There was no difference in quantity unless stated on the menu, so small pieces made us laugh.  Won't be back. the pricing was ridiculous for what you receive."
IHOP (455 Sterling Lyon Parkway),4,"I had a fast, good soup, for a reasonable price at IHOP.
The staff are super polite and fast when you need something.
I had potato bacon soup... delicious and filling
The atmosphere is a very typical breakfast/lunch style."
IHOP (455 Sterling Lyon Parkway),4,"We recently had a chance to have our breakfast at ihop and the food was good. I had avacado toast with hash brown and buttermilk pancakes, latte coffee and splasher. The coffee was disappointing but the food was good."
Wendy's (1420 Mc Phillips St.),5,"Staff went above and beyond to prevent contamination with my allergy.  On duty manager insured everything had been sanitized, and there was no exposure. First time in a long time that I didn't feel sick after having fast food.  I'm allergic to wood, so all paper products. She had all gloves changed, everything put in plastic and handed it to me, avoiding the bags. I carry straws, so I was good there. I was amazed by the service."
Wendy's (1420 Mc Phillips St.),5,The staff at this location are amazing! A+ customer service. They make you feel welcomed and go above and beyond to make sure you have a good experience every time. The restaurant is very clean. Food is always served fresh and hot. I always look forward to coming back here.
Wendy's (1420 Mc Phillips St.),4,"Food was good, been here many times, first I ever had to ask for a bathroom key. Kids enjoyed there food. Wife was upset you don't serve any plant based burger options as she not big into salads."
Wendy's (1420 Mc Phillips St.),5,Its the best place to eat in Winnipeg. Great service and Prices and the staff is friendly and great. I recommend everyone to try the best 2.29$ bacon cheeseburger it is the best
Wendy's (1420 Mc Phillips St.),5,"The best bang for your buck! The junior cheeseburger deluxes are the best deal comes with tomatoes, lettuce, onions and pickles!"
KFC (750 Sherbrook Street),5,"One of the most cleanest and brightest restaurants I have been to in a long time.
Lots of parking available as well great location for when visiting someone in the hospital as well. Drive thru window service as well if one is unable to sit and relax and enjoy the scenery.  Great customer service  Washrooms where clean and safe as one has to be let in by an employee. Drink fountain is open for refills if one decides to sit and eat great for people with children. Wheelchair friendly"
KFC (750 Sherbrook Street),5,"Amazing, staff, location and restaurant. Food was very delicious and fresh. Great service."
KFC (750 Sherbrook Street),1,"Taco Bell
I have been here several times
This last experience in the drive thru I had to repeat my order a few times.  When paying it seemed more expensive than I was anticipating.

When digging into the bag for burritos,  there was no hot sauce and the reason the bill was more expensive was the wrong burritos were ordered (more expensive versions of a similar burrito)

Realistically i will be back again at some point, maybe a different location"
KFC (750 Sherbrook Street),2,"There is nothing to write for food for a giant fast food chained restaurant. Its the service to talk about. I always order from drive-thru and it seems like they do the bare minimum to take and prepare your order. They never pay heed to the instructions.I always ask for no lettuce and no shredded cheese on items and they ALWAYS MISS. I always get lettuce and cheese, no matter what they never listen. It feels like they hear to those instructions and they outright refuse to follow them or ignore them. Its frustrating when you have no time and order from drive thru then going in and have you asking them to fix the items is not time- affordable"
KFC (750 Sherbrook Street),1,"Food is always cold!!!!!!
Does not matter the time of day
5 times in a row I had to go back and request hot chicken from this location.
I have went to other KFC's and got hot fresh chicken. Never at the Notre Dame and Sherbook location, this was my favourite location for many years. Now I probably wont be going back."
Double D's Cheesecake & Coffee House,3,The atmosphere was kind of dull. Waited long time to get drinks and food. But the taste was amazing. Loved the pasta with shrimps. Ordered chicken too and it was a little bit chewy.
Double D's Cheesecake & Coffee House,5,My 16 yr old son and I dined here. He had the Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken and I had a 1/2 order of the Greek Salad with Chicken. Both were great! Son commented that Fettucine... was the best he has had. That's a pretty good compliment as he is very particular. The service was exceptional. It was quiet but it was after 7 on a Tuesday night. We will be back!
Double D's Cheesecake & Coffee House,3,"3.5/5
Rustic to describe the atmosphere, the dinner experience was typically with very friendly service, the restaurant needs to be renovated for its outdated looks, the food was average, nothing special, reminds me more of truck stop food. Paid $56 for two meals, shocked by the prices"
Double D's Cheesecake & Coffee House,5,"Place had a real vibe. I had Chicken casar salad , food was homemade style . I told the waitress I was gluten free, so no croutons or garlic bread,  but  she brought me gluten free garlic toast , I don't usually get that so much appreciated. Appeared every  table was occupied. Great , genuine, friendly service.  First time for me , I'd definitely go back again ."
Double D's Cheesecake & Coffee House,5,It was delicious and the server was really nice. They gave us a gift for mother‚Äôs day too. That was very sweet of you guys thank you so much!
RnR Family Restaurant (1615 Regent Ave W),2,"Myself and my friend agreed to a 2 out of 5 stars for this restaurant. When you walk in, it has the classic Perkins look, the food in the display case and the toy machines in the front. We were quick to be seated and we observed maybe 3 other tables for breakfast. Upon ordering I had my young daughter with me, we got our drinks and she got to coloring. Me and my friend chatted for a while and before we knew it my daughter had colored both sides of the paper which I knew we had been waiting a good while. She asked where our food was, then about 5 minutes after that the food came. I ordered a breakfast burrito, the flavor itself was good. My only complaint was that the chicken was ""sharp"" overcooked. My daughter didn't eat very much, her bacon looked almost black and complained later on after while we were shopping she was hungry. I guess it was a good thing kids ate free that day. My friends food, they asked for a medium well cook on the eggs. The eggs were cooked soft, it grossed them out and the eggs were soaking into the other food items. Their bacon too looked overcooked, but worst of all was the sausage. The sausage was so overcooked it was like charcoal in the middle. My friend ate the ""good bits"" off of it and that was that. We heard behind us a table that was complaining about overcooked fish, so I knew that this was probably a common thing. The waitress was kind and I did feel bad for her since it wasn't her fault after all. I left her a nice tip and headed to the bathroom before leaving, to put it simple, the bathroom was extremely gross. The lack of a lock on one stall made someone push toilet paper into a spot that filled up the hole. This was the first and last time myself or my friend definitely will come to dine, hopefully for others the food will be edible."
RnR Family Restaurant (1615 Regent Ave W),4,"Nice diner experience, Lawrie our server was very friendly and attentive. Food was average diner fare. My meal was 13.99 and included 2 eggs, 2 sausages, hash browns and pancakes.

Lawrie has a great attitude and made the experience very nice."
RnR Family Restaurant (1615 Regent Ave W),2,Service was good and so was the coffee but the food wasn't. I had the Chicken and waffles the chicken fingers were dry and tough. The maple gravy stuff they use ruined the whole dish. The texture and taste we unlike anything I have every had and not in a good way. My wife had the fish and chips the batter was excessive and the the fish had some bones in it. We went right at lunch time and it was dead about 6 tables in the whole place had people at them. Hopefully it gets better as they seem to have some good ingredients to work with but the combination and execution are missing the mark.
RnR Family Restaurant (1615 Regent Ave W),5,"A few weeks ago me and my family went to RnR for breakfast for an early celebration for Mother‚Äôs Day. This was our first time going since the changeover from being a Perkins. We weren‚Äôt disappointed, the Food was amazing, the service was great and we all loved seeing more local items on the menu. Needless to say we will be back!"
RnR Family Restaurant (1615 Regent Ave W),5,"My family and I had Easter Dinner at RnR .  We like the choices of a traditional turkey dinner or another item off the menu.  I chose one of the new Strawberry Salads and it was delicious and I would highly recommend it.  Other family members choice the turkey dinners.  The service was excellent and it is a treat to not shop, cook and clean up after a big meal."
The Pourium,5,Great Italian grocery store! The prices are a little higher but the selection of food is impressive! They even have bresaola. We haven‚Äôt tried their pastries but they look delicious. They have a parking lot in the back. If you are looking for Italian items this is the place! They also sell kitchen tools. Absolutely recommended!
The Pourium,4,"De Luca‚Äôs is a fun place to shop. Their prices are higher for basic items you can easily get at larger grocery stores, but the pull of this place are their specialty items that they make on site. The fennel sausage is especially good and they have an array of fresh pasta which is perfect should you host an Italian dinner and you want to make something with free noodles. Their bakery is pretty good and they have a fine selection of speciality olive oils and vinegars (you can taste a number of them if you ask). Some of their imports are good too (e.g., canned cerignola olives) and are tough to find elsewhere. I‚Äôve checked out some of their cooking classes in the past. It‚Äôs fun, but observational only while seated at group tables. Still, it can be a nice evening with friends with decent food. I‚Äôve never tried the restaurant upstairs for lunch, but I hear it‚Äôs good."
The Pourium,4,Always a pleasure to stop in and grab some items for a great meal.
The Pourium,5,"The staff are really nice, and theres a pretty big selection on everything. Whenever purchasing pre-made foods, they are delicious and I always want more. Things are a liiitle bit pricey, but I understand they are family/privately-owned, and I don't mind paying the price to support local whenever I can afford to do so."
The Pourium,5,I always go to the really nice dessert and pastry section. I highly recommend the cannoli and beignets! Staff is always friendly.
Thai Express (1225 St Mary's Rd #FC2),2,"It's sad to say, but Thai Express in general is in a downward spiral.
I used to enjoy the Pad Thai or the Cashew Stir Fry...but for some reason, the quality and taste has declined over the past year. I'm unsure if they have a new supplier or a new way of preparing the food, but something is definitely off.
Neither myself nor my partner were asked for the level of spiciness, and the food is now served on plastic plates. Well, I guess that saves on using plastic straws...(joking)
I would not recommend this location if you are trying to decide where to eat in this food court."
Thai Express (1225 St Mary's Rd #FC2),5,"I have no idea where these 1 stars are coming from. Been coming here for years and have never had a bad meal before. I‚Äôm gluten-free and they know exactly what I can and can not eat. Super good food and big portions, I‚Äôd give it 6 stars if I could."
Thai Express (1225 St Mary's Rd #FC2),1,Absolutely disgusting! My food was moldy and they refused to refund my barely eaten meal.
Thai Express (1225 St Mary's Rd #FC2),1,"Storefront lady tried charging my wife twice saying the transaction didn't go through, but card statement online showed otherwise. Didn't get a refund, didn't get our food, called our bank and surprise surprise, the bank confirmed Thai Express lady tried charging twice. Good try trying to take double our money, lady..."
Thai Express (1225 St Mary's Rd #FC2),4,"Update:  Upping rating to 4 stars (from 1).  After a very pleasant email exchange back and forth with customer service they have provided me with a $15 e-gift card for the error.  Much appreciated Thai Express, thank you - and next time I will check the box BEFORE I leave with my food :-)

Original Review: Ordered Pad Thai for lunch today, in person, at the counter, said NO MEAT.  I take it back to the office, open it up and it's full of chicken. . . I'm vegetarian, $15 wasted and I still have no lunch.  HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT!!"
Calabria Market & Wine Store,5,"First time ordering from here. I ordered the Calabria salad for lunch today and it was delicious! I ordered the large not knowing how big it would, as most places now have really been scaling back on portion sizes. The large was very big, enough to feed 2 to 4 people as a starter salad. The lettuce and tomatoes were super fresh. They did not skimp out on the ingredients, very generous with the toppings."
Calabria Market & Wine Store,5,"Had a few slices of pizza at a work lunch and decided to order 4 pizzas for a family function today. They were able to half-bake them so we could finish them at home ourselves, and accommodate people's arrival times. The pizzas did not disappoint.  Everyone was impressed. We had cheese lovers, steak lovers, meat lovers and Carolina chicken. Will be back for sure, and spend a bit more time in the market. They sell dough and all ingredients in case you want to make your own. Great find."
Calabria Market & Wine Store,5,"The BEST place for pizza, homemade goods such as cheese, pasta, baking‚Ä¶ect. They also carry a large variety of wine from around the world.

They also offer gluten free pre-made meals

My go to when I forget lunch. Pictured is chicken veggie soup and red velvet cookies"
Calabria Market & Wine Store,5,"I‚Äôve been a fan of Calabria for over 15 years and I love how the food is still the best in the city! The pizza is hands down my favorite. The Deluxe is my go to and there just are no words to describe it other than perfection!
I currently live in NYC where there are pizza joints on every block that have great pizza but there‚Äôs something about Calabria‚Äôs pizza that will never compare. It‚Äôs just that good!!!
I look forward to my next trip home so I can get my fill of pizza üòÄ"
Calabria Market & Wine Store,4,"Love the flavour, and pull of the cheese. The sauce has a beautiful tang to it.; yet there is still a bit of sweetness. This is great pizza. The crust is a bit heavy and chewy for me. My own personal preference is a bit lighter and a little more crunch. But, I did not see an option to order the bake 'Well Done'"
Robin's (250 York Ave),5,"What an awesome breakfast! Had to grab a dozen donuts to share, they look delicious!!"
Robin's (250 York Ave),5,"I don't get donuts often but when I do I like Robin's.  Well I had shown up and to my dismay there was no strawberry bismarks and I don't like the powdered sugar donuts with filling.  The lovely staff offered to make me some on the spot.  Try getting that kind of customer service at Tim's!  I left with three delicious strawberry bismarks and three ghostbuster donuts.  The only negative I could ever think to give is I wish they'd bring back the fudgebuster donut.  Used to be my favourite, but I guess it wasn't a big enough seller."
Robin's (250 York Ave),5,"My company and I were in town for some sales meetings and needed an alternative to overpriced hotel food. That is where Robbins came to save the day. Not only was the breakfast excellent and the doughnuts delicious, but they were willing to help me bring it to our meeting area. They understood our request and came in clutch when we needed to provide last-minute lunch. All of this with a smile and reasonable prices."
Robin's (250 York Ave),1,I order from you on occasion and your always out of something. Today you missed almost my whole order! I ordered 7 items and only received 2. Why? Why is it so hard to read a screen and then make it? I will not be ordering from you again. No wonder why all your restaurants are closing down.
Robin's (250 York Ave),5,Great quiet little place. They fixed up the outside a while ago and now last year the fixed up the inside. Tried the breakfast this morning. Great price $6.99 and comes with a small coffee! It was great. Highly recommend it. Check out the nice sitting area! Will be back for sure. Thanks guys and gals.
Denny's Canada (1750 Sargent Ave),5,As always name itself talks. Food was amazing and service was good as well. Just recommending to keep the washrooms more clean.
Denny's Canada (1750 Sargent Ave),5,"I came with my two teenagers today for breakfast.  My son was excited to try the Baconalia pancakes and they lived up to his expectations!  My daughter tried the strawberry crepes and said they were delicious.  I had a classic slam and was not disappointed.  Lots of great food, awesome service from our server Bri, and leftovers to take home!"
Denny's Canada (1750 Sargent Ave),5,The food and service was excellent and it is really nice that we have healthy choices for breakfast. I had the build your slam and and of the choices is egg whites.  You can pick up to 4 choices & extra choices are only $1.79 each  I only wish they would open a location in st.vital as soon as possible.
Denny's Canada (1750 Sargent Ave),5,"Fast and great customer service. Food was perfect. Also worth mentioning was our server  Alanna B, she was awesome !"
Denny's Canada (1750 Sargent Ave),5,Food was great.  Restaurant was completely packed but the server Alanna was friendly and efficient. The wait for food was very reasonable considering how busy it was.  Great for our picky family.  One kid had chicken wings for breakfast while the other had pasta.
OEB Breakfast Co. (Winnipeg),5,"They cover your parking fee if you go on weekends and park in the building's underground parking!!! Make sure to add your name to the reservation list before you come!!!
I love their food and their menu. Honestly, you probably need more than 1 visit because all the items on their menu sound really good. The food is in a higher price range but I think it‚Äôs worth it. The service is fast and professional, the seating and restaurant interior design is really nice. We only had their coffee and it was tasty, will come back and try other drinks and update. Their short ribs on the poutine were so juicy and tender, definitely recommended."
OEB Breakfast Co. (Winnipeg),4,"The food was great. I had one of the breakfast poutines and subbed half the potatoes for spinach!

But the service was just okay. They seemed shorted staffed? The server was taking care of many, many tables and also cleaning her own tables to turn them over. We had a hard time getting the servers attention to ask for a refill and when we finally asked it never came.

Update: Went back again and it was delicious! I liked that they had options for kids (some half portions). My kids loved the French Toast."
OEB Breakfast Co. (Winnipeg),4,"Went here for Sunday breakfast, still early so the place wasn‚Äôt so busy.

I enjoyed the Eggs Benedict. Service was good too, our server was very attentive and checked on us regularly.

You can park on the street (like Pioneer) or in the parkade (OEB validates parking on weekends)."
OEB Breakfast Co. (Winnipeg),5,"One of my favorite brunch spots in Winnipeg. Although it is a bit on the pricier side, I believe it is worth the treat as they use quality ingredients and techniques in their dishes.

The Duck Confit, French Toast Trifle & Duck and Pierogies are my favorite dishes! Highly recommend adding yourself waitlist on Yelp."
OEB Breakfast Co. (Winnipeg),4,"We heard a lot about this place and finally decided to check it out. The ambience and decor is great, the service is excellent and the staff is so friendly.

They also have underground parking which they validate on weekends, which is great, especially for downtown.

The only miss is the portion size, which is definitely on the smaller side, taking into account it is definitely on the pricier spectrum for brunch style food."
M√°s Coffee,5,"For a dining experience that surpasses all expectations, look no further than Deer + Almond. My most recent visit to this charming restaurant with a very special lady was nothing short of exceptional, thanks to the personalized menu and remarkable service that elevated our night to a whole new level.

From the moment we were greeted at the door, we were treated like royalty. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and keen to create a meal that would delight our palates and cater to our dietary restrictions. We could tell that they truly cared about curating a unique experience just for us.

We were blown away by every dish that came out and even though they looked too pretty to eat, it was like heaven on a fork. Pair that with some wonderfully curated wines and we felt lifted to a higher level of dining experience.

What really sets Deer + Almond apart is their commitment to catering to each and every guest's unique needs. Every detail, from the thoughtfully sourced ingredients to the stunning presentation of each dish, was taken care of to ensure our experience was nothing short of perfect. The cozy ambiance and dim lighting also added to the romantic atmosphere of the evening, making it a truly unforgettable evening.

In summary, Deer + Almond is a must-visit for anyone looking for exceptional food and a personalized dining experience."
M√°s Coffee,5,"We went there for a date night.
It‚Äôs a 4 course meal
77$ per person with no drinks and additional charge for specific dishes
The food, the best in Winnipeg.
Every dish was perfect.
The service was superb
The place looks nice but to fancy and it was noisy
Overall great experience, highly recommend"
M√°s Coffee,5,"Really an outstanding restaurant! The service is awesome because they give you a wine tasting and also intricately explain the items you are ordering from the dining experience menu. Valpolicella Superiore and Deer Carpaccio are match made in heaven; it was my first time having a deer dish that too in carpaccio form - loved it and it was my favourite üòª from the menu! Green Pappardelle was soft and tasty with a flavour bomb in that fiery chilli oil, wow ü§©üî• Pork Schnitzel and Honey Custard had nice presentation but tastes ok compared to the first two dishes!! The restaurant is extremely hygienic and tip top with a casual ambience ü•∞ Palette cleanser served at the end and complimentary starter received were also good üòå"
M√°s Coffee,5,"Every detail was simply fantastic. The servers were so friendly and knowledgeable, sat down with us to chat with our kids and talk about the menu. Every dish so memorable and creative. This restaurant is top in Canada and a must visit on a trip to Winnipeg. My son ordered steak frites and the server said ‚Äúbest fries on the planet‚Äù and OMG‚Ä¶! üòÄ"
M√°s Coffee,5,"The best meal I've had in Winnipeg. Hands down. Loved the vibes, the server was fabulous and so knowledgeable, really so great at her job. Had a cocktail, wine and the set 4 course meal, which has more selection than the a la carte meal. Deer carpaccio was fabulous, the peanut semifreddo was also so wonderful. Would go back over and over!!"
Oscar's Deli,5,"Incredible Deli with a gigantic selection of amazing food. Huge portions! Excellent service! I love the falafel! Great Hot Sauce! Corned Beef Hash! Huge Salads! Matzoh Ball Soup! Grab an Imperial Cookie on your way out! Easily my favourite place to eat downtown, and very affordable."
Oscar's Deli,1,"Oh no! We used to enjoy the Reuben sandwich back in the day, but unfortunately now the quality and portion is disappointingüòî Since the new management took over, the famous Reuben is not great! The meat was old and almost grey in colour (last time we checked it should be pink/red in colour) and was missing the Swiss cheese. Our stomachs paid the priceü§¢ My dad took one bite, and never ate the rest of it! The pickle however was awesome‚úÖ I hope they get it right next timeüôèüèº"
Oscar's Deli,4,"This place was Oscar's Deli, not calling itself anything else. We had cheese blintzes. Tasty, served with plenty of strawberry jam and sour cream. Two small, neatly folded blintzes for a very reasonable $8.
We were there as they opened at 7am. We will go back for a lunch during our stay. Menu and prices looked great."
Oscar's Deli,1,"Very Rude people, they sent the wrong food,  and to the receipt from them is impossible. They are rude to you, they insult you and you are expected not say anything to them. Their Customer service sucks and it is hard for me to explain how rude and impossible they are; I ordered a Catering Package for one of my Client and I am not from Winnipeg. they sent the wrong food and i said no problem i only want my credit card receipt and detailed bill receipt for my expense report.

On Tuesday morning, July 18, 2023 i went to get my receipt but I was not able to get is is due to Supervisor not available; while I am waiting for turn, a Lady left disappointed with their service as well and her order was not ready. So, people wants to focus very little success and good comments but not on the many bad attitude of the owner and some of his people; many customers are not going to tell the owner of the business how bad they are because they want them to fail and close their business."
Oscar's Deli,5,"Very good location and parking is quite easy with street parking available (and Winnipeg is offering 1 complimentary hour parking daily). The place offers quite a lot of sitting and with covid you can have a piece of mind that you are not sitting in a crowded restaurant. The food is authentic, and there are quite a lot of options on the menu for everyone. Staff are friendly, and food came out very fast. I would go back for the fries, matzo ball soup, and the brisket sandwich.

Second review!
Had to go back for matzah ball soup and more sandwiches. So delicious!"
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (840 Waverley St.),5,"It was a very great experience. It was Tuesday, so we tried the offer 2x4. It‚Äôs a very good deal and choice. We added a very delicious white toast w/ butter, really it was the best toast (butter was the best) eaten in Winnipeg. The crepe was full of fruits. The food was very tasty and delicious. The staff members were nice and understanding what is hospitality means! They served a wrong item and once we told the lady working in service, she changed it right away. The owner was very nice and gentle, he offered some stickers for my baby. The place and washrooms were clean. I‚Äôd like always to go back again and again."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (840 Waverley St.),5,"Fun, inviting and delicious food!

The wait staff here were very pleasant and always had a smile on their face. The food is always impressive with the vast amounts of fruit served with each meal. I ate here 5 times in 5 days, because it was so good! There were lots of menu options no matter what time of day I went. The coffee was pretty fantastic as well. If you're much like me I would highly recommend the ""Louis the Undecided"", as it gives a variety of different types of food- if you can't settle on just choosing one."
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (840 Waverley St.),5,"As an Aussie who loves his food (especially breakfast items lol) the food was amazing. Also, the chocolate pancakes with banana and choc sauce was delicious.! However, what made the whole experience great and wanting me to come back was the amazing service we received. Marci was our waitress and her freindliness, attention to our needs and her all around willingness to help us have the best experience was what made our visit to Cora's exceptional. Iam just sorry we didn't get back there before leaving but will definitely be back in the future. Thanks Cora's and Marci :)"
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (840 Waverley St.),5,The best and friendliest service we have experienced and such delicious food!! And even though we went at a real busy time they made sure we didn‚Äôt have to wait long.  The fruit was dilicious! Highly recommend checking it out and enjoy a good breakfast here!
Cora Breakfast and Lunch (840 Waverley St.),2,"Our latest experience with Cora's was dismal and disappointing. Aside from not receiving over half of our order, which admittedly may not be the restaurants fault, the food we did receive seemed hastily put together and unappetizing. We used to love this place, but unfortunately it has just fallen off our favorites list."
Mama Nors Kitchen,5,Love this place. Food is available quickly and amazing. The service is great and staff is soooo friendly even if you do not speak the language.
Mama Nors Kitchen,5,"It is a must-try!
I have been a customer since day one. There is no doubt that this is the best Filipino restaurant in the city.  This is a small, family-run restaurant that treats its customers as if they were members of the family. Additionally, it represents top-notch Filipino hospitality and culture in terms of food and service to the community. We always enjoyed fresh, delicious food at any special gathering or event in our family. It is my hope that someday it will continue to grow and achieve greater success in the future."
Mama Nors Kitchen,5,"I absolutely adore the food from Mama Nors. I always get either spamsilog or a combo (pictured below) with sunny-side up eggs. I always have it delivered through Doordash, but I did make it in one time. The owners were some of the sweetest people ever!! Definitely recommended."
Mama Nors Kitchen,5,This is one of my favorite take out food in Winnipeg. They sell quality tasting foods and the quantity and price is affordable. Papa Dave and Nanay will greet you with Joy and will make you feel happy. They add extra happiness to your orders and that is something other stores don't have.
Mama Nors Kitchen,1,"HORRIBLE! Am allergic to fish and tons more,They used a fish tong on my chicken.After I saw, i asked them about it and the just lied in my face! I certainly said I was allergic but they did not deny. They are not allergy friendly. Please look what tongs they are using."
Grill City (Winnipeg),5,"I had ordered a small beef steak, 2 barbecue sticks, calamansi juice, and a plate of rice. The staff were without a doubt helpful and exceptionally kind. The pricing is fairly standard and the food is exceedingly tasty. I would recommend to any curious inquirers."
Grill City (Winnipeg),3,Ordered palabok but not as good as Jolibee's. I only got one small shrimp and half sliced of boiled egg.
Grill City (Winnipeg),1,"the presentation of the food that has this bulosa, but unfortunately its taste leaves much to be desired, the pasta was absolutely tasteless, the meat was dry, and the shrimp began to smell of ammonia that we could not eat them‚Ä¶

Sadly bad experience!!!"
Grill City (Winnipeg),4,"I ordered 2 Tilapias no rice, which was delicious. The people working there were friendly but I wish the prices were a bit lower."
Grill City (Winnipeg),5,"Loved this place. Best grilled foods and best value for money. Very clean and they have enough staffing all the time. If they have sinigang in menu and you are dining in, you can ask for complimentary sabaw on side. They have bento like breakfast silog. Lot to choose from."
Casa Ilocandia,5,"Very friendly staff, food is superb and feels like home! Reasonably priced and huge servings. üëç"
Casa Ilocandia,5,Great food at a reasonable price. The goat kambing was delicious. Parking is a bit limited.
Casa Ilocandia,5,John is doing fantastic. He is professional in Philippino food .üëçüèª
Casa Ilocandia,5,Best filipino food in the city!
Casa Ilocandia,5,Good and delicious food all day long
Pita Pit (640 Sterling Lyon Parkway),5,"I went there for rice bowl,,, didn‚Äôt know what to get as a vegetarian‚Ä¶. Cashier and trainer Arsh was amazing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I am so happy with the service‚Ä¶ will definitely come back"
Pita Pit (640 Sterling Lyon Parkway),1,"The 2 ladies working here have quite the attitude. I received an important phone call that couldn't have lasted more than 5 mins, so I stood against the wall with a mask on and away from the till, not speaking loudly. She asked me twice while I stood there if I was ready, clearly annoyed the 1st time and the 2nd time rolling her eyes and went to the back and didn't come out for several minutes, the other girl also shot me a glance and followed the other. There was no one behind me waiting, had there been I would have let them go ahead. There was no apparent reason to be rushing.
When I put the order in for the pita they normally put green peppers, onions, mushrooms on the grill with the protein. They failed to do that. All of the toppings I asked for she put a minimal amount. When she handed me the pita she said ""have a good one"" in a snarky tone.
I'm not sure why they felt any of that was necessary. Even if 1 of them wanted to go on a break or something they could've, it wasn't busy. But I will definitely not be coming back to be regarded this way again for $14."
Pita Pit (640 Sterling Lyon Parkway),4,Second time here. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Pita was good but could use a bit more meat. Food was fresh though. Would go back.
Pita Pit (640 Sterling Lyon Parkway),2,"Friendly staff but the owner seems to hate the world and apparently doesn't check restrooms. Men's restroom was without toilet paper and paper towel and the paper towel dispenser was ripped off the wall, laying on the floor.
At least pretend to care about those giving you their hard-earned money!"
Pita Pit (640 Sterling Lyon Parkway),5,"Everyone is very friendly and took the time to hear what our kids were wanting (quiet mumblers, my kids). We messed up our own order and they fixed it for us, no fuss.

I drive out of my way to go to this Pita Pit and will continue to do so!"
Knight & Day Pizza (870 Main St),1,"I tried to call to order 3 pizzas and some pop, he said it was too big of an order then immediately hung up on me before I could ask how much I could order for delivery or say anything else. This is the second time this exact same thing has happened so I will no longer be ordering from this pathetic business. Maybe if your employees spoke English they wouldn‚Äôt be so rude and ignorant."
Knight & Day Pizza (870 Main St),5,"Okay....you guys know I'm super fussy ..... first time having this pizza and all 5 of us happy, happy, happy.  No mistake in the orders.   Arrived hot and fresh.  Crust were crispy on the outside and soft and chewy perfect inside.  Loaded with topping and the perfect amount of cheese.  No chintzing on the toppings.  I've fallen in love with the butter chicken pizza; not too spicy but not bland.  We ordered through Skip."
Knight & Day Pizza (870 Main St),5,"2 bucks for a small tasteless pizza slice and  almost no gravy in the poutine

Edit : I git reimbursed for my meal and it did not disappoint the pizza was very tasty and the poutine was delicious and the guy working today even gave me a cold pepsi to sweeten the deal"
Knight & Day Pizza (870 Main St),5,"I got a large super deluxe pizza for around 20$. One of the best pizzas I‚Äôve had in a long time. Never been in store, if it‚Äôs clean, this will be my new go to pizza place!"
Knight & Day Pizza (870 Main St),5,"Every weekend I order food from KD. It‚Äôs tasty, delicious and fresh every time. MOST RECOMMENDED STORE IN THE TOWN."
Mar's Sisig - Jefferson,4,I usually just call to order and pick it up. Their kare-kare and sisig were my personal favourite! They serve different varieties of Filipino dishes and delicacies which I should try next time
Mar's Sisig - Jefferson,1,"We ordered a take out ordered of 100 pcs of eggroll and  20 pcs of turon on friday to be picked up at 9:45 am. The person who took the call even checked the kitchen if they are able to make the order for the next day, they guaranteed that they can and even told us the total for the to go order.  When we were there on friday, 9:45 am, they said that there‚Äôs no order with the name and number provided. They insisted that we have might ordered it at the other location. To mind you that this had happened 2 times already with the reason that ‚Äúthey had no paper indicating that there‚Äôs an order.‚Äù The restaurant did not acknowledge or apologize for their mistake but instead tried to argue."
Mar's Sisig - Jefferson,5,"First time here eating here, staff is friendly. Wasn't sure what the foods were in the display case, however the staff was patient with my boyfriend and myself. She took the time to tell us what exactly was in everything and the names of them. Large food portions and service was great! We enjoyed our food here. Will be back again!"
Mar's Sisig - Jefferson,5,"We ordered 2 combos: one had 2 eggs and 2 meat portions(I went for 2 portions of sisig), and the second one had 2 eggs and 1 portion of beef pares. Both combos came with unlimited fried rice and unlimited broth soup. Everything came quick and everything tasted good. To top it all off, we had a really good experience. Everyone was smiling and happy. We would definitely visit again next time. We highly recommend this place."
Mar's Sisig - Jefferson,5,The food at Mars Sisig is really delicious. It reminds me of the food my father and grandparents make. The portions are good too. And the prices are great. It‚Äôs one of my go to places to eat and I live on the other side of the city. It‚Äôs definitely worth the drive.
Jollof Life Restaurant,5,"Recently just found out about this place and tried it out. The meals are very good but more importantly for me is the quality of customer experience and cleanliness of the place. Very interactive, hospitable, welcoming and friendly staff. The space is very clean and well maintain. >"
Jollof Life Restaurant,4,"Had a good experience here recently with a couple family members. The environment is clean, brightly lit, with Afrobeats music videos playing on the TV. There was one server when we arrived. She seemed quite preoccupied with takeout and delivery service orders, so we got our own menus. After about 15 minutes, she was able to serve us and was pleasantly helpful. We were familiar with Nigerian food, so the menu was easy to understand. One ordered Ewedu with Gbegiri and suya, the other jollof rice with fried plantains and turkey, and myself beef pepper soup. The dishes were served hot and overall tasty. For us, the fried plantains weren't ripe enough, so they lacked sweetness and were dry. The suya wasn't prepared on a grill, maybe oven roasted? So it lacked the authentic smokey grill flavour and smells. The seasoning provided with it was good. The beef pepper soup was quite good, not very spicy though and a bit salty. It would have been near perfect if rice, yam or plantains were served with it to better balance the seasoning. As well, with the soup being $18, the amount of beef in it was small, with some pieces being moreso fat or cartilage than meat. Overall, we're glad we went and will come back to try more dishes."
Jollof Life Restaurant,5,"Drove 45 mins just to try this restaurant! My first time eating amala, ewedu and gbegiri and it was incredible! The food was on our table in less than 10 mins. It was plated so well, and the workers were so kind! When I took my first bite, I knew I‚Äôd be coming back again. I had to ask for more food because it was incredible! The owner was so happy that we loved the food and was more than willing to give us more! This place just opened 3 months ago and deserves a lot more recognition! There‚Äôs plenty of seating and highly recommend you bring your friends with you!"
Jollof Life Restaurant,4,"Overall, the food was good and the service was excellent. The waiter was friendly, and the wait time wasn't so bad.
The only downside for me was the Ofada rice. It had stones, It wasn't fun chewing at all. The ayamase sauce quantity was little and not enough proteins in it for the price."
Jollof Life Restaurant,5,I went again for dinner and the whole experience was even better than last time. Definitely coming back again:)
Atiga Restaurant,5,I only tried their cassava leaves. Amazing taste but poor portion. 20$ you get a tiny bowl. The bowl looks wide from the top view. it is small in height. it may be filled with small sauce. By the time they add the big piece of chicken there is not that much stew tbh. It comes with rice ( the rice is more than the stew can serve). Those plantains are worth 7$. The chicken also tasted great
Atiga Restaurant,3,"I've been told by my family that their jollof rice is quite good hence the three stars. Additionally, I'm not comfortable giving a black business especially an African restaurant, a one star so the three star stays. Honestly the fried rice is without a doubt the most ""uncomfortable"" thing  I have ever tasted.
And the meat??? Let's just say you can do better
Also it is a requirement that if you're gonna call yourself an ""African restaurant"" you should add some spice
Note that I didn't say pepper , I said spice!
You can do better, please be better.
That was quite an uncomfortable experience"
Atiga Restaurant,3,"Went for dinner recently with my partner and a couple of our friends. We were the only patrons there the entire time, but a handful of delivery drivers had come in to pick up orders. It has a 'hole in the wall' type vibe, with friendly staff and afrobeats playing in the background. It was unfortunately quite cold inside, the a/c was on. Three of us ordered jollof rice with beef, which also came with fried plantains, a boiled egg and some coleslaw. The fourth person ordered goat curry with rice. Akira was on the menu but not available, which was disappointing. Our food was delicious but unfortunately had no spiciness to it. We did ask for and was given some hot sauce, which was home made. But, it moreso added a different flavour to the dish rather than spiciness. The food can definitely be enjoyed without making it spicy. The beef was a bit over cooked but still tasty. They do have the original Fanta, but it's in a small glass bottle for $5, which is far too expensive. At the end of the meal, there was no bill provided, the server hand wrote on a little scrap piece of paper a final total and gave to us. We all thought that was kind of odd, but they were able to accept payment by card. Our server was very nice. The food was served hot and in a timely manner. That being said, I don't think I'd go back for a sit down experience but I'd definitely order for take out or delivery."
Atiga Restaurant,3,"Atiga was an experience. Not necessarily a good one, but certainly an interesting one. From the Paw Patrol table mats to the AC that was randomly on on a cool September evening, to the way none of the four menus that our group received were the same (and possibly didn't include all of the same items), to how we were the only patrons in a 2hr window.

But you're there for the food, and the food was pretty good. Not as spicy as I like it, but tasty nonetheless. While we were there, there was a steady stream of food delivery guys, so they certainly appeared to be doing good business via one of the food delivery apps. The portions are also huge, but while it's good I think think I would rather go to Akin's. The food IS good, but it's not the only thing about going out, and Atiga's sole strength seems to be only the food. I haven't even talked about the quality of the service, or how there was no itemised bill. Nevermind all that, the building itself needs at least a lick of paint if only to brighten it up and make it more welcoming."
Atiga Restaurant,1,"dirty and unpleasant place.  I do not advise ordering delivery, they cook in unsanitary conditions"
VJoy Beverage and Dessert Restaurant,3,"I visit this place often to try their different beverages. Last night i visited and ordered one mango strawberry bubble tea. The quality of the product were not that good as compared to the old days and the customer service were not that impressive.I must say that ,their bubble tea and all other beverages are one of the best in town but their customer service and product quality degraded gradually. In the beginning when there was less business, i would say the customer service was really top. These things needed to be addressed and please maintain the same environment as before for the customers."
VJoy Beverage and Dessert Restaurant,5,"I've ordered from them on skip and also in person. Both times I loved my drink. They give the feel of Khab's while not being so far away. The idea of unlimited toppings for $1 is also awesome. Most times I want more than one topping and I get to save with this. However, to get the cheese milk foam topping, you pay an extra $1. There was a promo for a glass bottle on my last visit, for orders over $15. It was so cute but smaller than I had imagined."
VJoy Beverage and Dessert Restaurant,5,The best place for bubble tea. The unlimited toppings makes the bubble tea experience out of the world. Staff is always super polite and recommends the best flavours to try out.
VJoy Beverage and Dessert Restaurant,5,"*** NEW BUBBLE TEA & DESSERTS ON PEMBINA***

again, was referred to go here by a friend, he was really persistent on trying their mixed flavors - what they're known for!

little did I know it was just a soft opening I went to, but the owner is so kind and friendly, told me all about his plans and business ideas for his restaurant.

I got the strawberry + lychee bbtea mix

PROS
‚Ä¢ unlimited toppings!! (for XL bbtea orders only)
‚Ä¢ one stop shop for all desserts, they have waffles and Korean shaved iced as well (not yet available)
‚Ä¢ a cute, colorful getaway from the outside world, the inside of this cafe feels like you're on cloud 9 literally
‚Ä¢ new, clean & friendly staff!
‚Ä¢ instagramable wall for customers to enjoy their food or drinks

CONS
‚Ä¢ location is at a weird corner between Pembina & Dumas, if you miss the turn to you have to go all the way around.

Overall, will be coming back soon to try the remainder of their menu items!"
VJoy Beverage and Dessert Restaurant,5,Excellent place! And have wonderful drinks. I order from here every once in a week when I have a get together with my friends.
Royal Punjabi restaurant,5,"We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Naan and Chapati. The chicken and naan were delicious, the chapati wasn‚Äôt my style but other people might like it (It tastes similar to a homemade pancake with no sugar). A note for the tikka mashala: it can be intense and spicy on its own, eating it with bread or other sides was the best for me :)

Will order more dishes soon üòã"
Royal Punjabi restaurant,1,Worst Manchurian and panner pakoras. Wastage of money. Never recommend this place to someone.
Royal Punjabi restaurant,5,"Wonderful meal, huge portion, make you feel worth it!   Happy chef and the family team to greet us the guests!"
Royal Punjabi restaurant,5,"A very extensive menu of delicious offerings, and very reasonably-priced. There's over 40 appetizers alone, and many main dishes, both vegetarian and with meat (chicken, lamb, goat). Try the Chicken Vindaloo, order it extra-spicy, and hang on! The Butter Chicken practically melts in your mouth, it's so tender. The Samosa Chat is a work of art, sprinkled with pomegranate. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the kitchen is always humming, and the lovely Sukhpreet at the front counter will tend to your needs. Try it, you'll love it!"
Royal Punjabi restaurant,3,I went for dinner at this restaurant couple days ago and the most disappointing thing was that they serve their food in disposable dishes and give you disposable cutlery. I could never expect a restaurant‚Äôs dine in service like this. The food was good but the quantity served wasn‚Äôt sufficient according to the price.
7-Eleven (311 16 Ave NE),5,"I'm still eating here while I make this review. This place is amazing! They have cooking on the TV instead of sports and that's awesome!
Ordered #2 and the sauce came heated. First time I've ever had shrimp rolls with warm sauce and it was phenomenal. I loved it. #21 is very tasty. The meat is lovely. I'll be back here again. The staff has been very accommodating and very friendly.

Eat here and you'll enjoy it"
7-Eleven (311 16 Ave NE),5,"My son and I started with shrimp salad rolls, then night owl pho noodle soup. Special fried rice with chicken wings.
The food was served hot and fresh. Delicious and tasty, we're very satisfied with the food üòã They are open until 2am üëç üëå"
7-Eleven (311 16 Ave NE),3,"Checked out Night Owl for dinner. Really wanted to like this place based on other reviews but found it was mediocre overall.

Service was sufficient. Atmosphere is alright, it's a small restaurant so not good for large groups or longer stays.

Spring Rolls were overcooked and dry. $7.50 for 3 seemed pricy for what they were. Soup was flavourful, but wasn't a fan of the tomato slices being added. They also offer 1 size only, which is priced on the higher side."
7-Eleven (311 16 Ave NE),5,The food was tasty. There was quite a bit of wait to be seated. Smaller restaurant than you may think. Staff were super friendly. Parking was a tough one too. Minimum space for parking as there is another bigger restaurant right beside it
7-Eleven (311 16 Ave NE),5,Great place for a late night meal as the name suggests - they‚Äôre open til 2am! I really enjoyed the rare beef Pho - definitely one of the better places in the city for it. Service was quick and efficient. Very affordably priced too so great for when you‚Äôre craving something cheap but healthy/filling (i.e. not fast food).
Subway (6th Ave),5,"Loving their new menu. Rotisserie chicken is great, so are their new Italiano subs/salads."
Subway (6th Ave),4,"Subway is nice, fun and everywhere. It's convenient food. I get the veggie sub all the time and load it up with as much stuff as I want. It is Subway, it is always there and is an affordable good price. That is all anybody ever wants."
Subway (6th Ave),5,excellent customer service here! I placed a mobile order on my lunch hour and I chose the wrong location. The ladies here called me and helped me reunite with my salad. Thanks for helping!
Subway (6th Ave),5,The woman working this morning (March 23) is so lovely and wonderful. I had the best interaction with her and it absolutely made my morning. Thank you!!
Subway (6th Ave),5,"The Best most delicious salads. Choose your ingredients,  have it chopped if you like, for smaller bites, add some hot or cold chicken, pick your dressing. About $7+
Portions are large."
McDonald's (North Hill),1,"This McDonalds has turned being awful into an art. They can't possibly be this bad by mistake, it has to be some sort of in-joke with the staff. It's the only restaurant I have ever frequented that will consistently mess up your order Every. Single. Time.

Eating here, you will no doubt experience one of the following of my more recent snafus: plastic bits of cellophane in the coffee, half your items will be missing from the bag, incorrect sauces on the burgers, your sandwich will be made where the bottom half of the bun was upside down (see pic), or just plain penny pinching stinginess like put half an ounce of gravy on the poutine or only filling up the fry box a laughable halfway (see pics).

It's to the point where you need to not only check the bag for accuracy, but unwrap every sandwich and open every box and manually inspect each item for accuracy, because they clearly refuse to do an ounce of quality control themselves.

I only frequent this location as I live a block away and fast food is *supposed to* be convenient.

Staff is wicked polite, though. That's the thing."
McDonald's (North Hill),1,"As I was about to pay for my food this muslim lady was eating food while talking  to us. It made me and my bf grossed out so we cancelled our order in the end.

Also when I order at night they always say that their computer is broken so they cant take orders. Ive heard this line for the 3rd time already this week. It really just shows managers only hire lazy people. I really hope this place gets shut down."
McDonald's (North Hill),4,"Good location, double lane drive through, your typical McDonald's so don't expect gourmet food but it's fresh and hot unlike some other locations. The parking lot is usually clean and neat, a decent drive through but tends to get busy from time to time. Still short staffed so don't be surprised to stand in the line for 10 min."
McDonald's (North Hill),1,"Very bad service here , don't come here
Night Staff is very rude and very bad behaviour with customers
You have to long wait for your food"
McDonald's (North Hill),1,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Terrible service in the drive through. Charged us for an extra medium fries and a large that we didn‚Äôt order. Asked for extra skor bits in a McFlurry and there is no skor at all. Ordered a poutine, there was no gravy. Asked for an orange fruitopia, they gave me strawberry. Tried to call the restaurant to ask what the heck was going on, they answered the call multiple times just to hang up on me."
Wendy's (1181 49th Avenue N.E.),1,"Thanks for the fries, but I asked for a baked potato w/e typical drive thru service üòÖ im not gonna drive back and forth for a potato. I guess I have to check in the bag and make sure I have the order I asked for and paid for from now on. Life lessons. Lol"
Wendy's (1181 49th Avenue N.E.),4,"Overall it's been good service, but their iced coffee is crazy overpriced for what you get -- their summer sized $2 iced coffee is about as small as a McDonald's iced coffee If you want an iced coffee that tastes just as good then just go to McDonald's."
Wendy's (1181 49th Avenue N.E.),1,I just do drive thru ... the service is great the food my last trip wasn't the best my burger and fries were cold and my coke very flat
Wendy's (1181 49th Avenue N.E.),1,For the second time in a row I've ordered a Caesar salad burger combo  via skipthedishes at thid awful restaurant. No croutons no cheese no bacon wilted lettuce the burgers are thrown together by somebody who doesn't care. I normally give restaurants a second chance which I did and the same result stay away they don't care. Wendy's you should be disappointed to have this franchisee in your network unless it's corporate
Wendy's (1181 49th Avenue N.E.),5,"Nice service, food was as usual which is often a pleasure to know the restaurant you are eating at, maintain the standard that reflects what one would expect at any other location."
Freshslice Pizza,5,"I recently had the pleasure of trying the medium pan 12"" pizza from Freshslice Pizza, and it was an absolute delight! The base, consisting of white garlic sauce with red peppers and green peppers, combined perfectly with the shadow cheese, butter, and chicken sauce. The toppings were generous, including extra onions, extra pineapple, and flavorful grilled chicken breast.

What truly sets Freshslice Pizza apart is their commitment to customer satisfaction. Not only was my pizza cooked to perfection, with no burnt spots on the top, but they also left a heartwarming note with my order. The one-on-one free option they offer is fantastic, and even though there was a minor issue with a burnt pizza in my previous order (which was promptly resolved), their thoughtfulness shone through with a sweet message on the box, accompanied by a sticky note saying, ""Hope it's OK with you today.""

While I can't compare this particular pizza to my usual timings, I can confidently say that Freshslice Pizza consistently delivers on taste, quality, and customer service. The flavors were robust, the crust was just right, and the combination of ingredients was a burst of deliciousness in every bite.

If you're looking for a pizza that goes beyond the ordinary, Freshslice Pizza is the place to go. Their dedication to ensuring a positive dining experience is evident in both their scrumptious food and their attentiveness to customer needs. I highly recommend giving them a try - you won't be disappointed!"
Freshslice Pizza,1,"So I ordered Ubereats
they had a promotion 2 for 1, I was going to order either way but when I saw the promotion I decided to use it because why not. The pizzas were old and dry and am praying it won‚Äôt make me sick. Weird tasting sweet dough with barely any sauce ü§Æ, I am sure that‚Äôs not what they sell when you pick up.

They are up to something, so my advice is to avoid this branch but if you must don‚Äôt order delivery go order at the store and pick up.

For me am done I have no trust in this place.

Restaurants seem to have forgotten that promotions are to promote your product not to sell old inedible stuff and destroy your reputationü§Æü§¢"
Freshslice Pizza,5,Delicious!!! My sons new favourite pizza and it rates in the top 10 across North America for me
Freshslice Pizza,5,"Great midnight slices that are affordable. Fresh pizza with friendly service and the crust is light and fluffy so it doesn't weigh you done.
Having ranch and hot sauce on the side so you can dress your pizza how you like is a nice touch"
Freshslice Pizza,5,Great pizza!! Its nice to be able to grab some food late at night at your store. Love the free ranch and cheese available for everyone too! Nice workers!
Actually Pretty Good (Bankview),5,Neat little pizza place up on bankview. There are a few sit down tables in this cozy spot. Perfect for a date night and the pizza was delicious. The menu has a few different options with fresh takes on tried classics. I'll have to try the hot honey dip next time I'm in. Would highly recommend the Brussel sprouts as well!
Actually Pretty Good (Bankview),5,"Wow ü§© This place has such a cool vibe!
Actually Pretty Good has left the best impressions! Amazing people to get the best service and food! Grease wheel zza and Linguine are a must!!
Extensive and seasonal Menu. Definitely worth trying food pairings with wine or beer!

These guys also do brunch now! I‚Äôll definitely be back for it!
Highly recommend place üçï"
Actually Pretty Good (Bankview),5,Love the decor in here! They have the most delicious gluten free pizzas! I will definitely be back!
Actually Pretty Good (Bankview),5,"I still think about the kale Caesar salad...good balance of flavour so yummy, will go back for it. Liked the pizza, not my all time favourite but glad we got it! Call ahead to book a reso, as not too much seating at bankview location ! Didn't get the parm garlic fingers but a couple next to us did and looked so bomb"
Actually Pretty Good (Bankview),5,"We ordered delivery last night - grease wheel pepperoni, kale Caesar, caprese salad and cheesecake. All were amazing, the pizza was smaller at first look but it was high quality and we didn‚Äôt finish, salads were also high quality fresh and large, we have leftovers for today! Definitely be ordering again and as the name says! Thank you"
Walmart (1212 37 St SW),5,"I have consistently had a satisfying experience at this McDonald's located within Walmart. The fries are consistently delicious, the chicken nuggets are freshly made to order, and the burgers are excellent. Since I relocated to a new area, I have tried other McDonald's in different locations, but unfortunately, the food has been disappointing in comparison. When I used to visit Westbrook Mall, I always preferred McDonald's over other options in the food court. Well done to the staff at this McDonald's for consistently delivering a great dining experience."
Walmart (1212 37 St SW),2,"Didn't get food. Was charged for it though. The kiosk said printer was out of paper,  go to the cashier.  Long line up and constant ringing from the deep fryer was sensory overload.  Got my money back the next day. I made the mistake of ordering fries and it took like 15 min. They gave me a medium fries instead of a small for the wait. Too many delivery orders and long waits."
Walmart (1212 37 St SW),5,My first McDonald's in Canada xd Loved the mango-pineapple milkshake!
Walmart (1212 37 St SW),1,"One of the worst McDonald's I have been to. The food is typical and staff behavior is good. But very poorly managed. Takes forever to take order and to make it. A simple order of coffee will take on average over 20mins to prepare and give it to you even though there is more than 4 staff working.

Sometimes I stand there for 20 minutes before someone comes to the counter and takes my order. It's freaking ridiculous.

THIS STAFF AT THIS STORE NEEDS BETTER TRAINING."
Walmart (1212 37 St SW),1,"Employees aren't attentive, nor do they care if the quality of their food meets standards.
Constantly gives out wrong orders, damaged products and the location is super mismanaged
0/10 try again"
BarBurrito: Calgary: Sunridge,4,"Generous portion size, very filling, and reasonably priced. With its authentic cuisine, friendly staff, and festive ambiance, it's the perfect spot to satisfy your craving for Mexican food and indulge in a fiesta for your senses. Decent amount of options for Vegetarians as well. We tried bean burritos and extreme fries."
BarBurrito: Calgary: Sunridge,5,This was my first experience but I am sure I will go here and try everything. I actually ordered for 2 person and was expecting my bill for $35 to $ 40 but surprisingly it was not even $25... Taste was amezing specially the sweet dish which I forgot the name of it but it was way too awesome.. Service was good all staff was helpful and not in hurry to serve as this was my first time. Overall best place for Taste and price budget... Will recommend everyone to visit and enjoy...!!
BarBurrito: Calgary: Sunridge,1,"Absolutely bad experience!
Went there around noon and they had literally no veggies. The elderly lady who served me was absolutely rude and yelled at me when I requested for fresh lettuce instead of the left over. The server pushed me to get rice after I requested no rice. She said ‚Äúit‚Äôs part of the recipe, she can‚Äôt skip it‚Äù.
Are you serious?!?! Called them later and the person who answered the phone did not let me speak with the manager. Stay away from this place if you don‚Äôt want to ruin your lunch hour. Thanks!"
BarBurrito: Calgary: Sunridge,1,"Here my verdict a big thumbs down ordered by skip the dish app. Chicken quesadilla

Was burnt not enougjh cheese chicken was not tasty. The buffalo chicken bowl and California chicken bowl were a total disappointment. Very sub par when compared to other Mexican places in town and we spent $$$$"
BarBurrito: Calgary: Sunridge,5,I like the lady crew here. You know she loves her job and always happy to serve her customers. I like how she was very precise with my customized burrito and very patient overall. Their Beef Burrito was great!
Clive Burger,5,"Best burger I had in Calgary so far! Glad I went in today for lunch.

The team was super polite and friendly, I recommend getting a vanilla custard shake! Absolutely phenomenal especially on hot days like today!

The burger was super juicy and cooked perfectly, the bun was fresh and everything was super delicious!

Will be back for sure!"
Clive Burger,5,Amazing burger even better customer service. First time but deffo not my last!!
Clive Burger,5,"Always delicious and consistent! Perfect burgers always cooked just the way I like it , crinkle cut fries are delicious and always in paper to ensure that crunch! Keep up the great work to your team! Burger science at its finest."
Clive Burger,5,"Rich is the best, great service, food and a quick conversation as my food was being made. I‚Äôm not disappointed I drove from Temple NE during stampede at 6pm for this food. Love the Clive sauce Will be back!"
Clive Burger,4,"Burgers weren‚Äôt bad and their patties were decent, but I‚Äôm picky about my beef patties. So I wasn‚Äôt overly impressed. The bun was okay and so were the rest of the ingredients used, but I probably won‚Äôt go there again for burgers.
Their coffee milkshake was delicious though, I might stop by sometime just for the drink."
Mr. Sub (Forest Lawn),5,"I came here by chance a few months ago and now I‚Äôm addicted. Friendly owners, clean venue and delicious subs. They always load the subs up; in fact I even uploaded a picture (that‚Äôs just a regular size). So glad they are close to my work - but to be honest I‚Äôd make the drive even if they weren‚Äôt."
Mr. Sub (Forest Lawn),1,"I always ask for extra toppings, they take advantage of using a food delivery service not listening to the request on the orders"
Mr. Sub (Forest Lawn),5,I was served by an amazing staff member named olga she was so nice and friendly and She recommended all the right things. I‚Äôve never had such a good sandwich before. Very lucky to have her.
Mr. Sub (Forest Lawn),5,Happy to be a Mr Sub customer since the 70s! Great service and awesome lunch today  Cookies are delish and i am so lucky to be near you! Best subs in calgary!
Mr. Sub (Forest Lawn),1,"I'm usually not the type to go out of my way to write a bad review. But, this asian lady with the earrings was rushing me and was just rude in general. I much prefer the older man, he was so nice. But, somebody needs to talk to this woman about customer service. She was basically picking everything for me and talked to me like I was stupid when I was just trying to figure out what I wanted to eat."
Sunset Grill (333 96 Ave NE),5,"Food was delicious and service was great! It was a nice place to have breakfast when my flight got canceled and needed a place to figure out what to do for the rest of the day.

Server just let us stay there for a bit to figure out what to do and never rush us out. She and the manager just came around and filled up our coffees.

Will definitely come back."
Sunset Grill (333 96 Ave NE),5,"Best breakfast in town. Period.

Very friendly service and very accommodating. Gluten-free options! Generous portions, tasty, fresh ingredients.
Clean with a lot of seating."
Sunset Grill (333 96 Ave NE),5,"This is a great location to head over to whenever you‚Äôre craving some good breakfast/brunch items. The menu is very informative on calories, gluten-free options and much more! The menu items are fairly priced, the waitresses are kind and attentive (always checking up on their guests to make sure that everything is going well), other staff are polite and the food tastes great. My favourite item on the menu is definitely the diced hash-browns, or as the menu refers to it; ‚Äúhome fries.‚Äù"
Sunset Grill (333 96 Ave NE),5,"The atmosphere of this location fits perfectly for a place to eat brunch with friends and family. The customer service was excellent, as the waitress kept checking up to see how our meal was and how she could help improve the experience. The food was amazing, as every plate had a different experience to it. The avocado toast was the highlight of the meal, everything tasted fresh."
Sunset Grill (333 96 Ave NE),5,"Amazing and hugely underrated breakfast place. Their bacon and sausages are easily 3-4x the size of the bacon and sausages from A&W. Their portions are crazy good. And the best part? The quality is still amazing. You are doing yourself a disservice going to another breakfast place. In today's inflationary world, restaurants like these are incredibly hard to come by. 5/5 easily."
Original Joe's (8th Ave and Centre),3,"Service was excellent, food was average.  Nice outdoor seating on the Stephen Av.
We had an original burger, a salad bowl with chicken, and drinks. The location is great on the south side of the 8th av not directly exposed to the sun at noon."
Original Joe's (8th Ave and Centre),5,"Had a great dinning experience. Sarah our server was a delight and very friendly. The food felt like great value for money! Had the Jack Daniels Burger with a Tank Lager.
Would recommend! We dined at around 6:30pm which was perfect timing for the sunset and just before the place got crowded."
Original Joe's (8th Ave and Centre),5,"Good food and friendly service. Had nachos and the grilled cheese  burger.

The burger was juicy and the nachos was great."
Original Joe's (8th Ave and Centre),5,"Great food and awesome Service. Definitely a great place to try.
The place is a walking distance from Calgary Tower.

We tried
* Nachos with spicy beef
* Margarita and beer"
Original Joe's (8th Ave and Centre),5,"Wonderful service, food and atmosphere all around! There was absolutely no wait for orders to be taken, food delivery, or payment! + their mocktails were delicious!"
Canadian Pizza Unlimited (9650 Harvest Hills),5,"The gentleman expressed an act of kindness I‚Äôll never forget. I cam in for lunch and ordered a slice of pizza and a pop. And realized I forgot my debit and told him ‚Äúsorry. I‚Äôm going to have to cancel my order‚Äù. He ‚Äúsaid no you are hungry please take this. And pay later‚Äù.

It is a kindness I will never forget."
Canadian Pizza Unlimited (9650 Harvest Hills),3,"Great pizza but don‚Äôt order anything fried. I ordered some wedges and it‚Äôs clear they used day old(or more) oil. The wedges were soaked, burned, and well just gross.

However their pizza is pretty good. I recommend the Punjabi veggie one if you like cilantro. I can‚Äôt faithfully give 5 stars because I‚Äôve worked in restaurants myself. I know precisely why these wedges look and taste the way they are."
Canadian Pizza Unlimited (9650 Harvest Hills),5,One word.... Wow!  I had CPU before at different location it was underwhelming. Came across at this new CPU location and we give it a try. We order their grand opening special 14 inch pizza for $10.99 with five toppings. It is a very good deal. We also had their Fried Chicken. Their food is amazing from the pizza to the fried chicken so Finger Licking Good. Eat Your Heart Out Popeye's or KFC. Their fried chicken was so good it must have been made to order because we waited for 20 minutes for their Fried Chicken. Give this place a try you will not disappoint.
Canadian Pizza Unlimited (9650 Harvest Hills),4,Good quality food vs. Price. Got combo deal medium pizza with 4 topping and 10 pcs of wings with crazy bread for less that 30$
Canadian Pizza Unlimited (9650 Harvest Hills),4,"It is my go to place for good pizza , until I find a better one"
Poutinarama,5,"Great little spot for some Montreal food. Steamies were good and the poutine was delicious the cheese curds were on point!! Jean (owner) was super nice and made us feel very welcomed and took great pride in the food he served. Will definitely be back again, highly recommend this little gem."
Poutinarama,5,"The poutine here is TELLEMENT D√âLICIEUSE!

Every crispy fry was nicely covered with a delicious gravy and there was a good amount of squeaky cheese curds and other toppings. We tried fully-loaded steamies (smaller hot dogs) and especially loved the fresh coleslaw! We brought our 21-year old Australian cousin with us and his first Poutinarama poutine got him very excited for his trip to Quebec next week!

Service was friendly and welcoming and the store was clean and bright. Merci beaucoup!"
Poutinarama,4,"Good quality food, excellent service! Thank yoy for having Toonie Tuesday! Your Steamies were an affordable treat. I appreciate you grilling the onions and was really impressed when you cleaned the tables after the people waiting for takeout left. Montreal smoked meat poutine was very good. Love those squeaky cheese curds! My only complaint is, I wish the fries were crispier. My son enjoyed his delicious cheeseburger made with fresh beef on a brioche bun."
Poutinarama,5,Nice friendly and cozy restaurant. Food is very similar to back home in Montreal. It is more expensive than what I'm used to but I guess normal for calgary. I come Tuesdays for there steamies special.
Poutinarama,5,"The poutine was incredible: fresh cheese, yummy gravy, crispy fries all combined with ample amounts for a party in your mouth! Did I mention that they also make THE BEST BURGER in town? Firm bun, seasoned patty with tasty char, fresh toppings, and oh the secret sauce. üòã My wife had the hot dog and was not disappointed. Big wiener, split and fried to release all the flavour, all served in a brioche bun with ample fresh toppings. The owners are super friendly and welcoming. The eat-in is cool, clean, and funky. What are you waiting for? Come make your poutine dreams come true! Try the burger!"
Riverfront Wine & Spirits Liquor Store,5,"Great coffee, very friendly staff that didn‚Äôt mind to accommodate our special coffee order. Super comfortable seating!
Also tried their Espresso Martini which was excellent."
Riverfront Wine & Spirits Liquor Store,3,"The service was excellent. However, the london fog was terrible. It taste like lukewarm milk. Not enough vanilla syrup and no Earl grey flavour. I could‚Äôve gone behind the counter and made myself something much better. The Earl grey tea should be made with much less water to get a much richer flavour. The amount of water used should be the same amount as about 2 shots of espresso. Also the tea should be either stronger and better quality or seeped for longer. The rest of the drink should be whisked milk. Please double or triple the amount of vanilla syrup in the recipe."
Riverfront Wine & Spirits Liquor Store,5,"Delicious baked good, wonderfully crafted atmosphere and love the latte too!!"
Riverfront Wine & Spirits Liquor Store,1,"Title: Extremely Disappointed with Gravity Cafe's Customer Service

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (1/5)

I recently had a terrible experience at Gravity Cafe that I feel compelled to share. As a regular customer who frequently purchases coffee from this establishment, I expected to receive at least a basic level of customer service. Unfortunately, my recent encounter with one of their employees left me extremely disappointed and frustrated.

Upon visiting Gravity Cafe, I found myself in urgent need of using the restroom due to a medical condition involving my short bladder. I approached a staff member, a young woman who I believe was named a ""tiny white girl,"" and politely requested to use their restroom for a quick visit. However, instead of showing any empathy or understanding, she rudely denied me access, leaving me feeling humiliated and disrespected.

As a customer, I understand that businesses may have certain policies in place regarding restroom usage. However, it is the responsibility of the employees to handle such situations with professionalism and kindness. This particular employee at Gravity Cafe failed miserably in this regard, displaying a complete lack of customer service skills.

Denying someone access to a restroom, especially when it is a matter of urgency, is not only insensitive but also reflects poorly on the establishment as a whole. It is disheartening to witness such behavior from an employee who represents the cafe to its customers.

Gravity Cafe should recognize that the success of their business depends on the satisfaction of their customers. By employing individuals who lack basic empathy and professionalism, they are jeopardizing their reputation and driving away loyal patrons like myself. No customer should have to endure such disrespectful treatment.

I hope that Gravity Cafe takes this review seriously and addresses the issue promptly. It is essential to train their staff to handle customer requests with respect and understanding. Until then, I cannot recommend this cafe to anyone, as I have lost faith in their ability to provide satisfactory customer service.

Overall, my recent experience at Gravity Cafe was nothing short of disappointing. The behavior of their employee was not only rude but also reflected a complete disregard for customer well-being. It is my sincere hope that they take immediate action to rectify this situation and prevent future occurrences."

8/10

‚Ä¢ One of my favourite cafes of Calgary as of late
‚Ä¢ Amazing interior with tons of seating and immense green living vibes
‚Ä¢ Not only do they have a common group seating area with couches and high-top tables, they also have a more private section with even more seating for those study dates and private chats as well as some outdoor seating
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm only docking a couple points because their choice of coffee beans aren‚Äôt my favourite but your mileage may vary and the quality of each drink varies a lot depending on who‚Äôs making it
‚Ä¢ Iced Chai (Ik it‚Äôs not coffee), Latte, cappuccino"
Edo Japan -  Aviation Crossing,1,"I always come to this location and for the past 4 times I been here they do not supply the chillies.  I mean 4 times!!!  Seriously I feel like we're being ripped off as they don't compensate for their error.  Very disappointed as the chillies really makes the meal.  For that reason I give it 1 star.  Another thing, portion size is small and where's the vegs?  Really being ripped off."
Edo Japan -  Aviation Crossing,1,"Not fresh. Mostly inedible meal. Beef was undercooked, stringy and chewy. Very small vegetable portion with large amount of overcooked, gooey white rice. Staff working the grill was more interested in giggling and playing around than properly preparing the order. What little I ate, made me feel ill. Well below usual quality for an Edo. Disappointing waste of $12.55. My recommendation...avoid!"
Edo Japan -  Aviation Crossing,1,"Google map says they open till 9pm.
Made an online order through app and paid through app. We Went to the location to pick up food and door was locked. I‚Äôve knocked the door and Owner came out. He says he‚Äôs closing early for Sunday. I‚Äôve Told him I‚Äôve paid though app and he says come back tomorrow and deal with it. I would never go back again and will never even order Edo ever. Spent over $32 for nothing.
Waste of money and time. This place is thief without knives on hand."
Edo Japan -  Aviation Crossing,3,"My daughter wanted a kids meal with Yakisoba noodles and grilled veggies. They told us that they couldn't do that , and there was a choice of beef or chicken only. And if we wanted the veggies we would have to order a full size. Unfortunate that having kids eating healthy isn't something of importance.
So I guess we had to order the full size and miss out on the kids pack."
Edo Japan -  Aviation Crossing,1,"I eat edo Edmonton locations at least 3 days per week 3ppl  freshness and quantity is fair but here in this place was The portions are so small compared to other Edo Japans. I ordered  2 chicken teriyaki chop  but the amount of chicken was ridiculously small and cold food , freshness is very poor not recommended this place,"
Pho Express,5,Delicious authentic Vietnamese food and really friendly staff. This is a wonderful hidden gem!
Pho Express,5,Second time here. They have a delicious veggie soup with lots of veggies (including bok choy!!) and tofu. Fast and courteous service. I‚Äôll be back!
Pho Express,5,A lovely little gem! They are quick in service and their food is delicious! So affordable as well. Will definitely come back again!
Pho Express,1,the worst beef sate soup i ever had. very few noodles- almost no beef - just a watery tasteless broth. what a rip off - much better pho on 17 ave se - cheaper as well.
Pho Express,1,Spent just a little over $10 for a beef saut√© sub hardly any meat. Hardly any vegetables all bun not too happy would not recommend.
South Silk Road Chinese Restaurant ‰∫ë‰πãÂçó,5,"Best Chinese restaurant in Calgary. I have been in Canada for almost 10 years( I used to live in Maritimes). This is my first time to have authentic Chinese food like this level. Not only was it so authentic, it is also very tasty. It is even better than some of Chinese food I had in China.

There is a stereotype about Chinese food in the west that it is all about chowmein and dimsum. What North Americans don't understand that China is such a big country. Food from different province are so different. I'm from Hu nan province originally. I love spicy food. Never had authentic and good spicy food in Canada except this restaurant. I still can't get over the fact that I had authentic Chinese food like this in Canada not in China. Hands down the best and authentic Chinese restaurant in Calgary"
South Silk Road Chinese Restaurant ‰∫ë‰πãÂçó,4,"The dinner of Chinese cuisine was a fantastic experience that I enjoyed with my friend after work. The ordered meat dishes were juicy and flavorful, and with each bite, the satisfaction increased. The Mapo Tofu had the perfect balance of spiciness and a tantalizing taste, making it an excellent complement to the rice. The dishes were not only fulfilling, satisfying my appetite, but also pleased my taste buds. Additionally, enjoying a cold beer alongside them helped alleviate the tiredness of the evening. The authentic cuisine and friendly atmosphere made it a wonderful place that I would love to revisit."
South Silk Road Chinese Restaurant ‰∫ë‰πãÂçó,5,"Had dinner with over 10 friends at this restaurant, everyone enjoyed the  dishes, taste good and very impressed. I also very like the private dining room, all friends can talk freely. Parking is free. Definitely I will come again."
South Silk Road Chinese Restaurant ‰∫ë‰πãÂçó,5,"Authentic Yunnan cuisine.  Amazing flavors with just the right amount of spice, but I love spicy food.  I would say the spice level is tolerable for most people.  The fish in chili oil soup is an amazing dish.  We also had the Kung Pao Chicken and Fried Green Beans in Black Bean Sauce.  I have had these dishes at many restaurants, but South Silk Road does them the best.  I think this is my new favorite restaurant!"
South Silk Road Chinese Restaurant ‰∫ë‰πãÂçó,5,We have found it to be a place to bring friends when visiting. They love ‚ù§Ô∏è  the athletic dishes for people that love hot spicy üå∂Ô∏è dishes. We enjoy bringing our friends here when they are in town visiting. Top review to chiefs staff and atmosphere.   We don‚Äôt use the many private rooms which should be reserved.
Cosmic Pizza & Donair (Crowchild),5,"This place got me and my partner through the pandemic, with great pizza choices at relatively low-price and a friendly atmosphere. As students, it's great to have economical choices that don't sacrifice the taste. Everytime we come by, their employees greet us with a friendly and upbeat attitude. (below is their house special pizza)"
Cosmic Pizza & Donair (Crowchild),5,"Just drove by this place to get lunch for me and my partner.   For about $32 we got a large chicken pizza, mozzarella sticks and two pops including dips.   The pizza was filling and had great taste!

If I ever drive by this shop I‚Äôd gladly eat there again.   We had left overs for dinner even.
For the price, quality of food and the environment I must say it was great!

I‚Äôd suggest checking this place out if you haven‚Äôt.

Our server was also a very friendly man. He has earned his 5 stars through great service."
Cosmic Pizza & Donair (Crowchild),3,"Nothing out of this world here at cosmic pizza. Flavor isn't bad considering the price but my big issue is the 2.50 or possibly 3.50 extra charge for about 5 actual pieces of fresh tomatoes on top and about 6 more tomato skins. I don't think it even equated to a ¬º"" thick piece from a roma tomato! Also asked for extra sauce as everyone should know, donair pizzas the next day don't do so well. I didn't get charged for the extra sauce, also don't think there was any extra sauce. Just wanted to try a new pizza spot with a decent donair pizza and sadly this wasn't worth it. Customer service at this location was spot on but because of a ridiculous charge for a miniscule amount of tomatoes, I won't be coming. Not worth it. And the boys at work all saw the pizza and now no one will be going to them as well."
Cosmic Pizza & Donair (Crowchild),5,Unbelievable. Tried the donair here the other day and it was made extremely well. Haven't had a donair like this since I was a kid. Really great service and kind owners. Will def be back.
Cosmic Pizza & Donair (Crowchild),5,"Leaving atmosphere blank because it's a takeout.

The staff here are awesome. My wife and I just moved in to the neighborhood, and found this place looking for new stuff. They were immediately welcoming, had a great chat, and then we ate. The Donair was AWESOME. My wife also had one, and enjoyed it as well.

We opted to come back for the pizza, and again weren't disappointed. Absolutely tasty, great for leftovers. The price was the best part, 20 bucks for 2 pizzas (pickup only) was awesome!"
Wendy's (1000 5 Ave SW),5,"What looks lackluster at first is actually THE spot for most online orders for Wendy's in downtown. They don't accept payment or orders on site, all orders are through apps like Ubereats. But, rain or shine, they're here for you. Through hail storm or heavy rain, they're open and ready.

The food itself is very average. David's single is the most average burger I have ever eaten. But they were fast, efficient, and open. And that's really all we need and expect from a place like this."
Wendy's (1000 5 Ave SW),5,Great to have a downtown location for pickup only. It‚Äôs a trailer in a parking lot so you order on any food delivery app for pickup or delivery from this location. Nice place to pick up food and eat in the park next door.
Wendy's (1000 5 Ave SW),5,Super fast on orders. It's only through skip the dishes and maybe doordash? But super quick service here and open late!! Keep up the great work!
Wendy's (1000 5 Ave SW),5,I just ordered from this Wendy's location and the chicken ranch asigo sandwich and poutine is AMAZING üòç they also sent a free chilli ! I would recommend this place to everyone! Best tasting Wendy's I've ever had!! Thanks!
Wendy's (1000 5 Ave SW),1,You can just Buy through Uber skip the dishes ir door dash not even the Wendy‚Äôs App. To bad and sad
Wasim‚Äôs Donair & Pizza,2,"Clearly, Wasim doesn‚Äôt work here anymore.

When I first moved up to this area 14 years ago, I discovered Wasim‚Äôs and became a big fan. Wasim was a young entrepreneur, who put a lot of love and passion in to his business and it showed. His pizzas won awards year after year and he was very popular. The pastas were always tasty and portions never skimped upon. I can‚Äôt remember when he sold the business, but it was at least six or seven years ago. Initially, the new owners remained faithful to Wasim‚Äôs vision, but over the years, the quality slowly slipped downwards. I doubt even the current owners are the ones who bought it from Wasim. Tonight I decided to get the baked spaghetti with meat balls. Let‚Äôs start with what was good. The pasta was well prepared. Not soggy and not undercooked. Al dente. There was loads of cheese and it was baked to a lovely golden brown. Very tasty. Now the bad. The very bad. The sauce was watery and tasteless. Chunks of tomato and ground meat were frugally spread around. Not a sauce at all really. When I called to place the order, the gentleman told me the meatballs are made with chicken. I was fine with that, until I bit in to one. As can be seen in the photo, calling it a meat ball is a gross misnomer. It is some sort of battered chicken mystery meat that was soggy and pasty. It was simply terrible. It was the only one I ate and gave the rest to my dog. He loved them. But hey, he also eats cow manure, so what does he know. This is likely the last time I will go to Wasim‚Äôs. Very disappointed."
Wasim‚Äôs Donair & Pizza,3,"They need to either change the wrapping paper out or change how they prep their shawarma as multiple times the wrapping paper would be burnt into the wrap and would have to pick off pieces of the wrap in order to avoid eating the paper. As for the Shawarma it was pretty standard. The meat was cooked well, the flavours were there, the price was reasonable, and the juices were dripping out. Now for the samosas...I found them very lack luster vegetarian samosas. Decent size but not decently filled and bland."
Wasim‚Äôs Donair & Pizza,1,"The worst baklava I've had, it was burnt and had way too much sugary syrup. Donairs are sub par. I wish I had better to say about a small business, but it's really nothing special."
Wasim‚Äôs Donair & Pizza,5,The customer service was great! I Got a medium beef donair and it was amazing! Also very good prices. Highly recommend.
Wasim‚Äôs Donair & Pizza,5,"We were passing through and hit this place up. They nailed the donairs! Good portions, fresh ingredients. Best donair Ive had and we will be back everytime we come to cgy."
Osmow's (4501 17 Ave SE),5,"I appreciate that they are a sponsor of Canada's soccer national teams. That aside, the food here is well worth it. There's deals you can take advantage of and staff were very helpful and friendly for a newbie like me. The shawarma is good but the one gripe I have is that the sauce made it very wet. The shawarma actually dripped liquid which can be annoying on the go. It's actually a very soft wrap, almost like a pancake."
Osmow's (4501 17 Ave SE),5,"I did it!
I found the best Schwarma Shop in Calgary.
I give six stars out of five so I don‚Äôt have to down regulate all the other good schwarmas in the city.
I‚Äôve been here twice now and met the manager, Inder both times.
He is very polite, attentive, eager and friendly.
I asked a bunch of questions and he answered them all patiently.

Both times I ordered a mix beef/schwarma wrap with a little lettuce, reg tomatoes, extra onion and a couple pickles; medium hot sauce with sweet garlic sauce.
The first few bites with no sauce, I found the meat incredibly juicy and tender with the most amazing spice combo.
It‚Äôs good all on its own with no sauce or spice.
The garlic is subtle with a perfect (relative) amount of sweetness.
They make their own hot sauces and I gotta say the medium was a true medium. Not too spicy with a little taste to it.

I also ordered an Osmow‚Äôs special.
It‚Äôs like a ‚ÄúMontfort Chicken‚Äù if you ever graced ‚ÄúMontfort Mediterranean Cuisine‚Äù in Oakville, ON.
It‚Äôs a pita wrap with chicken and pineapple. I ordered it with a little lettuce, extra onions and extra garlic sauce.
Oh my, this is the best sandwich ever!

The place is set up with a good flow, nice lighting and colours. Also the bathrooms were clean, that means a lot to me.
This is Hands Down the best Mediterranean schwarma shop in the city.
I predict long line ups in the future:(

*Just found out it‚Äôs a family chain.
Not surprised. It‚Äôs really good.  If it wasn‚Äôt already a chain I believed,hoped it was going to be!"
Osmow's (4501 17 Ave SE),5,"I can't wait to come back, it's so good and they use fresh chicken."
Osmow's (4501 17 Ave SE),5,"I‚Äôve ordered delivery from here almost every week. I‚Äôve only been to the location twice. 9.5x out of 10 they give the best food ever. Sometimes, if I order during rush hour, the food isn‚Äôt made perfectly but I still love it. My favourite is the shawarma poutine, which I could eat everyday if I could afford it haha. I also like the chicken on the rox and their chicken wraps. Sometimes the rice is hard, but still yummy.

The one bad experience I had was when I went to pickup an order and asked for medium (2 lines of hot sauce) and the lady didn‚Äôt believe me, so she only gave me half a line. Luckily I checked it in my car and went back to fix it."
Osmow's (4501 17 Ave SE),5,"Nice, clean and a respected place. My favourite restaurant to go all the times."
The Mash - Kensington,4,"Birthday party for a buddy. Fun atmosphere, server Kenzie was super nice and did a killer job.
Beer was cold and good
Pizza was good. Wasn‚Äôt the worlds greatest but they‚Äôve nailed the crust and use high quality ingredients.

Also birthdays get a free 10‚Äù pizza."
The Mash - Kensington,5,"Four of us went and had their caesar salad and two pizzas. The croutons in the salad is made with their own dough, I was not a fan because of the soft, doughy texture but that's just me. We ordered 2 pizzas but with 4 flavors. They can do halves if the base is the same. We had the dill pickle and bacon, wild mushroom, all meat and 4 cheese. They were delicious. Who would have thought of dill pickle and bacon."
The Mash - Kensington,5,"The Mash is a unique pizza place, and what makes them different is the material they use to make the dough. It is made from ""up cycled"" spent grain, used in the brewing process at the Half Hitched Brewery in nearby Cochrane.

In this symbiotic commercial relationship, The Mash also sells beer from Half Hitched Brewery and it is a good combination.

The pizza crust is crunchy, the toppings are generous and sometimes unique as well e.g. dill pickles and bacon pizza.

The service is friendly and efficient, the tables are rustic, some are recycled cable spools, the sofa / mini lounge sofas are showing some mileage, but overall, the basics  and the essentials, read pizza, beer, location and service, are on target.

The mushroom, veggie, meat, and dill pickle and bacon pizzas are all worth a try.

Worth revisiting!"
The Mash - Kensington,2,"TLDR: Disappointing Experience: Overpriced and Lackluster Pizza, Poor Service

Warning: Prices on the google menu and in restaurant are different. Their actual website is correct though.

Onto the food itself. I ordered the pizza, and to be frank, it failed to impress. While it wasn't terrible, it certainly didn't stand out as anything special or noteworthy. Especially for its price point. Given the numerous dining options available in Kensington, I would go elsewhere.

I found the server Sunni to be a bit not so sunny. She asked us to leave one of the patio tables because we ordered take out (when we ordered we intended to eat by the river, as it was a hot sunny day, but as it was completely empty there, and in the shade so we sat down on of the patio chairs to eat a slice or two). I found it pretty odd to kick out your literal only 2 patrons because they ordered takeout. Just poor business decision making on The Mash's part, why leave a bad taste in your customers mouths? I guess we found out why there is nobody there on a beautiful Saturday evening at 6pm. With that said, I see know reason to go here over the many better places in Kensington so I would skip this one."
The Mash - Kensington,5,"The best Pizza in Kensington, really nice private outdoor seating aswell. Can't go wrong with any of the choices on their menu but the dill pickle and 4 cheese pizza were my tables favorites, will be going back!!"
Pho HouZ Vietnamese Kitchen,5,"As a Vietnamese, this restaurant did a great job serving the traditional Bun Bo Hue. My friend ordered Pho Sate and she enjoyed it.
The price could be a bit high for students, but considering the location and service, it's worth it. Overall, it's a pleasant experience."
Pho HouZ Vietnamese Kitchen,5,"As a vegan I love this place, and I love that there is more than one vegan options. I‚Äôve anyways received amazing service.

Also very clean and the bathrooms too."
Pho HouZ Vietnamese Kitchen,4,Went in there for a bowl of soup ended up coming out with a ton of appetizers and they were all just delicious really enjoyed the wings a lot and next time I go there I'll probably just stick to the salt and pepper wings myself thanks myself. I had a Vietnamese beef stew soup and it was just delicious the meat was very ample no complaints there and the broth was quite tasty.  I didn't see much on the saute side of things but I will try it again will definitely be back
Pho HouZ Vietnamese Kitchen,3,"It‚Äôs alright, pretty much as advertised. Staff are helpful, friendly and attentive. Very clean and spacious with good seating. Menu has your classics and some unique options. Food was so so and nothing to blow your mind about. Definitely a good lunch spot as it‚Äôs central and easy to get to. Overall, standard spot with usually high prices."
Pho HouZ Vietnamese Kitchen,5,Some of the best Pho in town! The peanut sate soup is amazing and flavourful and has richness - the noodles are the best I‚Äôve had and the meat is perfect. We also got the coconut peanut curry soup and it was beyond delicious. Portions are large as well we both couldn‚Äôt finish it all
Gong Cha (Lincoln Park),5,"An amazing Bubble Tea spot! The baristas are all super nice, specifically Malia. She is always very kind and attentive and makes the drinks very quickly with much skill. 11/10 customer service!!"
Gong Cha (Lincoln Park),3,"It's pretty typical bubble tea, nothing special but everything I have tried has been good quality. Although this is the 21st century Gong Cha seems unable to offer no-sugar sweeteners which is disappointing for people watching their calories."
Gong Cha (Lincoln Park),5,"I'm correcting my review.. I tried bubble tea & smoothie in most of well known places of Calgary but the taste, quality, friendly customer service, modification in drink which I'm getting here that never got anywhere else. Particularly this location is awesome, clean, and yes you'll find parking easily. Don't forget to try brown sugar pearl milk tea & mango smoothi.. Love this place..‚ù§Ô∏è"
Gong Cha (Lincoln Park),5,"Excellent quality drinks! They only opened recently so their menu is limited compared to the one in downtown but there are still great choices to choose from. My personal favorite drink available at this location is the dirty brown sugar latte. And the staff are super friendly and knowledgeable as well, they'll even give recommendations for sugar levels."
Gong Cha (Lincoln Park),5,"Kumquat lemon drink was awesome. Very cool and refreshing on a hot summer day!
The staff was super helpful and accommodating. Loved the vibe ‚ú®Ô∏è great find!!!!"
Tim Hortons (117 1323 Centre Street North),3,"Limited donut selection vs other locations.  Service was unfriendly, didn‚Äôt feel comfortable staying to eat-in vibes of rushed and not welcoming to customers."
Tim Hortons (117 1323 Centre Street North),1,"Presentation use to mean something...

This Tim Hortons location is disgusting. Everything needs a thorough cleaning from windows to the washrooms.
It seems the new generation of employees in the service industry have little to no respect for their guests. If they did, this place and businesses like it would be clean and comfortable.

The industry from Tim Hortons to McDonald's has gone to the dogs.

Clean your stores and cafe shops!

Thank you

Sincerely,

Your loyal clientele"
Tim Hortons (117 1323 Centre Street North),5,"Everytime I have done my Mazda service's car, I stop in Tim Horton center Street. I love Tim Horton foods and beverage. Caffee is always fresh and good flavor. The Farmer's Wrap is fantastic for breakfast. The place need some atmosphere refresh but, it is a good place to spend time. The service People are kind and fast."
Tim Hortons (117 1323 Centre Street North),4,"Value for the money place. You cannot expect 5 start treatment. However, they are doing their best.
Food varieties are good. Everyone has something....
Good place. Will return back."
Tim Hortons (117 1323 Centre Street North),5,They‚Äôre short on staff and they do a amazing job getting food out on time and done properly
Fusion Sushi 17,4,"We got the all you can eat option and it was ok. The price is higher than the food quality as the sushi was mostly ok. The fried rice was my favorite dish, no complaints there. I'm giving it +1 star as the service was really good and I really enjoy getting sushi from a happy robot."
Fusion Sushi 17,4,"A lot of vegetarian sushi options! But... they're all pretty simple. You're not going to find super cool dynamite roll type combinations. They did have mango avocado, spicy avocado, and dried tofu avocado rolls. They were  pretty tasty and had a good filling-rice ratio.
Oh my goodness the seaweed salad! I have never seen a serving so huge! Usually it's just a side but one could have a whole meal of this (I don't know why one would but :p) I would probably not order that alone again, it felt like a waste. I would order smaller portions if available!
Service was good and sweet~"
Fusion Sushi 17,5,"If you want a robot kitty to deliver your food, this is the place. Nice lighting, Fair pricing for all you can eat. Floor in the entry could use some attention, very uneven so tread easily. Really good quality sushi and fast service. Servers are so friendly and helpful."
Fusion Sushi 17,3,It was good.  Beef with enoki mushroom was the only disappointment as the beef was very dry.  They also forgot our pad Thai. Otherwise Sushi rolls and sashimi was good.  Kitchen items were not bad as well.
Fusion Sushi 17,5,"All you can eat sushi. Super fun ordering through the tablet and watching the robot waitress. Great food, highly recommend it!"
Masala Bhavan Indian Restaurant,4,"We ordered Mysore Masala Dosa and Idli Vada Combo. Excellent food quality - fresh, nice spice level, soft idlis, hot crispy vadas. Sambar quantity is however much less than you‚Äôd want with these dishes and apparently (unlike most South Indian restaurants I‚Äôve been to) there‚Äôs an extra charge if you ask for more. Very prompt and warm service by Jordan - being the only server at the restaurant, he was managing more than 7 tables at one time. Great job üëè"
Masala Bhavan Indian Restaurant,5,"I absolutely loveeee the food here, the best garlic naan I‚Äôve had in my life. The curries were all super rich and fresh definitely a 10/10 Indian food experience. Also a veryyyy hood chicken 65. The service was a tad slow but that‚Äôs b/c it was so busy so try to eat there when it‚Äôs a little slower if possible."
Masala Bhavan Indian Restaurant,5,LOVE IT!!! Highly recommend if you are in Calgary. Food was exceptionally good. The dosas were crispy and perfectly cooked. Aloo masala was also good (but towards the blander side). The coconut and tomato chutney were delicious! I highly recommend the Mysore masala dosa. Server had good knowledge of the restaurant menu and was helpful. Service was also fairly quick.
Masala Bhavan Indian Restaurant,4,"Initially we were in the area coming to try another restaurant however the restaurant we wanted to try was full, luckily we were able to get a table here and I gotta say we weren‚Äôt disappointed. The food was really good,  my partner and I ordered various dishes,  the chicken was incredibly tender, the Tikka chicken appetizer was really nice,  the warm spices are a perfect combination for a cold night,  the chicken  vepuduu roast was incredibly tender, the menu did state the dish to be spicy, however I found it to be on the mild side. As for our main course we both ordered the butter chicken, with an order of Naan bread, that being said if you‚Äôre here with a group of four definitely get a triple order of Naan as the portions for Naan are a bit smaller,  nonetheless still tasty. I would say this is a definite contender for a top slot for southern Indian food in the city, well worth checking out"
Masala Bhavan Indian Restaurant,1,"Extremely poor food service.The South Indian non vegetarian food was very worse in taste or no taste at all.The goat cury portion was too less and the curry itself looked not tasty at all. Only one server was present, so it was a very slow service.On top of that, the burning sensation of my eyes from the kitchen smoke .May be I am too sensitive but atmosphere was not so friendly. In my view, there is no customer service at all.Simply waste your money and time.Even though I have not finished my ordered food due to taste and left from the restaurant."
Pacific Poke (Calgary),5,"Tried ‚ÄúThe Cali‚Äù for my first time here today (I ordered pick-up on the website)
It was delicious. Good amount of protein and toppings. I was happy with the value and freshness of the meal.
Only part was I asked for cutlery and got chopsticks in my bag. I managed.
Highly recommend"
Pacific Poke (Calgary),5,Best spot with poke in Calgary. It‚Äôs just amazing and delicious. Staff you r doing a good job. Always friendly and helpful. Just in love with this place.
Pacific Poke (Calgary),5,Went here for the first time today.  The guy serving was really friendly.  He even offered the option to mix rices.  I had the main poke bowl. Very filling and lots of flavors. I'll be back!
Pacific Poke (Calgary),5,"The veggie bowl was yummy, obviously wish there was more tofu but overall super enjoyable and would definitely come back! The crunchy toppings were so good as well, they were probably my favourite part."
Pacific Poke (Calgary),5,"Great spot with a clean and bright atmosphere and friendly staff. I ordered a regular-sized custom poke bowl that comes with two proteins. It was very generously sized - I could barely finish it! If you want the bowl with cauliflower rice, be aware that it costs extra because I didn‚Äôt see that on the website. Only issue I had was they happened to be out of the spirulina dessert I wanted to try, but overall, this is a great place and I hope to return soon."
Chatime (Marda Loop),5,"Quick service, great options, and easy to get to location! Friendly staff!

The pearls were the right amount of QQ and the sugar level I selected was just right!
Would return!"
Chatime (Marda Loop),5,"Sooooo good. The passion fruit green tea actually tastes like passion fruit juice and it is so refreshing. Also the hazelnut chocolate is just perfect. I find other places‚Äô tapioca tastier but theirs is not bad. However, the drinks are amazing. üôåüèª‚ú®"
Chatime (Marda Loop),4,"These owners are truly dedicated to their craft. They were open Christmas Eve right until 10pm and even open on Christmas Day!

Their Mango Slush with mango fruit pieces inside is excellent. Even at half sugar it is plenty sweet enough.

Their Buffalo chicken wings are pretty good as well as their Yam Fries üçü too.

Pro Tip - Make sure to grab a bunch of napkins as your fingers will get quite sticky.

It would be better if they had photos or video for their menu. It can be a little daunting to order there on your first time.

A great local business in Marda Loop."
Chatime (Marda Loop),5,Friendly staff and delicious drinks made fresh.
Chatime (Marda Loop),2,"I come often as I live in the area, but have noticed some things go downhill as of late. When I was in last, I witnessed an employee stick her finger in the blender and lick it to try it I guess and then proceed to pour the beverage in a cup. Not sure if she made it for herself. I certainly hope she didn‚Äôt serve it to a customer.

I also really dislike how hot the tapioca pearls are when they are served. I ordered an iced drink for a reason and when hot pearls are placed in the cup my whole drink gets heated up. There are better bubble tea options."
Pathway Burgers & Momos,4,"The food here is just exactly what i was looking for. I have tried chilli potato, Veg chowmein & veg momos. All three tasted the best so far. Huge space for parking, Airry atmosphere. Cost for 2 is also decent"
Pathway Burgers & Momos,5,"We ordered momos and noodles for takeout and we were not disappointed at all. The prices are reasonable and the food was too good. Specifically, the steamed momos were just amazing. The yellow salsa was also very good. Recommend this place and will return here."
Pathway Burgers & Momos,5,"If you are a momo lover, this restaurant is the perfect choice for you. Best momos in Calgary.  We ordered tandoori chicken momo & steamed chicken momo. Both dishes are delicious and authentic. Prices are very reasonable too. Plenty parkings are available. Definitely go back again."
Pathway Burgers & Momos,5,"Hidden gem! Not only are the staff super friendly and attentive, the food is exceptional!

We tried the chow mein, chilli chicken and mixed momos to start, they were all soo good we decided to save some for later and order the cheeseburger too! All of the dishes were delicious!

If you don‚Äôt live near by, this place is 100% worth a detour to come visit."
Pathway Burgers & Momos,5,Great service. We ordered the Nepali Noodle soup - slightly tangy but yummy. Our favourite was the chicken wings 10/10!
Menchie's (Northland Plaza),1,"Really bad experience.

the staff isnt welcoming or helpful. They are very rude . i waited at the counter till the 4 staff members sitting and having a discussion were done  discussing who would go to the counter to take the order and laughing.

even the quantity of cheese is less compared to other pizza shops.

Not coming to this branch again."
Menchie's (Northland Plaza),1,"I was with my son and I was in the wheelchair staff didn‚Äôt help with the door. Bought 4 bottles of pop cashier charged  regular even though it is a promo tried to rip me off $1.50 and when I asked him about it, he said oh I didn‚Äôt see that refunded me and didn‚Äôt want to apologize I asked if I could wait inside. He said he‚Äôs busy with customers coming in and out, I am a customer to. I just bought 4 bottles of pop and while waiting inside only two people came inside he wasn‚Äôt very busy. I don‚Äôt recommend it at all."
Menchie's (Northland Plaza),1,The worst pizza place in Calgary . I have gone here a few times . After the last time I will not return . There was a child she looked under 10 sitting in the back . She had her boots off and sitting at this little table close to where food is prepared . Very unprofessional and very unsanitary . The times I have gone in the man that brings the pizza and you pay for it I'm not sure if he is the manager he has never been nice the times I have gone in . The first time I went in and he was rude I just thought maybe he was having a bad day . No he is just a rude man . Then seeing the little girl in the back the health board should really go there .  Go to a better pizza place don't eat here
Menchie's (Northland Plaza),5,This place has the best pizza ever even the crust is good. Dont sleep on these guys
Menchie's (Northland Plaza),4,"Not sure why there are so many negative reviews, we have visited this place couple of times to get pizza and it has been a good day experience so far. The staff is very friendly, place is neat and clean. They are quick with service also. Pizza has tasted well all 3 times."
Om Cuisine of India,5,"Beautiful Restaurant in the Southwest Calgary area.
Taste of each of the dishes I tried was super awesome (I tried quite a lotü´£)
The food presentation was excellent.
The ambience and atmosphere was wonderful and peaceful.
The staff were constantly taking care of all the guests and keeping us busy and happy at the same time with their food.
It's a must recommendation from my side if you are in the town and looking for an authentic Indian cuisine and a lovely experience."
Om Cuisine of India,5,"Amazingggg Food!!
We ordered the paneer tikka and soya tikka and both the dishes were delicious and quality of the food is great, really fresh! The butter Naan bread is perfect!
A must visit as the food and service both are perfect!"
Om Cuisine of India,5,I ordered Lamb with Kadhai Sauce and chicken with Korma sauce with garlic bread. Everything tastes amazing and we loved it
Om Cuisine of India,5,"The food we ordered was papdi chaat, chicken biryani and ras malai. The food quality taste wise was great, excellent, and delicious.  We were checked regularly, and our feedback back was acknowledged.  The ambiance is very inviting .
We were highly impressed with how authentic the dishes served tasted üòã and we highly recommend this place if one is looking for great food and service"
Om Cuisine of India,3,"Ordered food from Uber.
Paid extra 30 cents for each container.

Chilly paneer was kind of sweet which I don't prefer. Small paneer pieces were coated with thick layer of maybe cornflour which made them look really big but not worth the money charged.

Vegetable fried rice could have been good but they forgot to add the saltüò¢

The rating I am giving here is because the naan were good and also because of the hand written note, that was sweet. Thanks!"
Flavours Restaurant (Flavours Cuisine & Catering),5,"Went in after reading the reviews and 4.5+ rating, and was equally a delightful experience. Really enjoyed the meal.

A group of 3, we went by their recommendations as it was our first time with Nigerian cuisine. Their meat puff/pastry is too good. The goat meat was a killer too.

The staff is really warm.

Just a small suggestion, maybe could work on the lighting of restaurant."
Flavours Restaurant (Flavours Cuisine & Catering),5,"We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here. Since it was our first time here, they took the time to walk through the menu with us and recommend things for us to try. We liked every dish and the experience was fantastic. They even brought out water dishes and soap for us to clean our hands as we ate with our hands. Great food, great experience, great service. Highly recommended!! We ordered a meat pie, puff puffs, suya, jollof rice with plantains and the African signature dish with goat."
Flavours Restaurant (Flavours Cuisine & Catering),5,"We had a great experience having lunch here. The staff was so friendly and helpful, and they were so welcoming of our toddler. It's always great when you feel welcome in a restaurant as a whole family. Food was delicious and the staff went above and beyond to make sure we were enjoying the meal. Definitely would recommend this place to a friend and will be back to try more dishes!"
Flavours Restaurant (Flavours Cuisine & Catering),4,"My wife and I wanted to try something different, and she saw them at the women's show, so we decided to give it a try.  Food was full of African/ Nigerian flavours and nice and hot ( temperature ) it was also spicy, but you can request how spicy you wanted it, and we ordered medium.  Since it was our first time one the owners suggested a few items we should try, and we did. We started off with a couple of meat pie and the puff puff, the meat pie crust was amazing and the puff put kinda reminder me of an east Indian called Pholourie but a bit sweeter. Then we also ordered Jollof rice and Suya.  Loved the Jollof rice, but the Suya was a bit dry for me and wished it was cooked to order as it was most likely made earlier in the day.  We also ordered Rice / beans with chicken for takeout so our son can also enjoy it as well.  We will definitely come back ....."
Flavours Restaurant (Flavours Cuisine & Catering),4,The food is great - definitely worth checking out if you like Nigerian food. I tried their fried rice which was rather mild on the heat scale. The staff were very friendly. Our friend who is not very familiar with Nigerian food ordered some goat (despite seeing the 'pepper' signs beside the dish name on the menu) and a sweet lady intervened to bring the heat down a bit! The jollof rice was also nice. I definitely ordered a portion of the amazing plantain fries! The only downside to the place was the price and the portions. I felt that the price was on the higher end (I am not sure if there are specific ingredients shipped in directly from Nigeria) and the portion could definitely be bigger to be filling for an adult.
Don't Yell At Me (Crowfoot),3,"First time ordering from this restaurant through SkipTheDishes.

The steak sandwich was alright, I didn‚Äôt like it much. Meat was chewy and came in big chunks, I think they should have been more shredded so you can eat it smoothly, so I unfortunately couldn‚Äôt finish the sandwich.

Chicken and fries were tasty. I loved the presentation and packaging, you can tell they care about satisfaction."
Don't Yell At Me (Crowfoot),5,"0.30 Wing nights are Tuesday‚Äôs . The wings here are awesome üòç. Veggie platter is also super awesome, not just your typical carrots and celery.  There are generally two waitresses , pick sam. She‚Äôs the one that smiles constantly and is the warmest sweetest waitress I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of being served by.  The other one ... let‚Äôs just say maybe hates her job? and takes that terrible attitude towards the patrons? We had the second waitress once and was so turned off that we didn‚Äôt go for months afterwards...  went back recently and Sam was so so so delightful.  Try to sit on far end of the restaurant by the walls and not windows. I think that‚Äôs usually her section. üòÅ

Wings are super juicy and meaty, veggies are always fresh and crispy . Service is fast and food comes out quick . Much better than brewsters in crowfoot( which also has a Tuesday night wing special )"
Don't Yell At Me (Crowfoot),5,"We've never been dissapointed when ordering from here for delivery! The pizzas we ordered never stood a chance!
Both Samoan and Pep were delicious."
Don't Yell At Me (Crowfoot),2,"(Horrible after repeat visits, keep reading) Great food, warm atmosphere, reasonable prices and the food is great. Did I say the food was good? Probably the best pub in the immediate area. Lots of games including pinball machines. The fish and chips special is to die for and their house burger is one of the best Ive had from a pub.

This was a 5 star review (as read above)until the bartender. I go to the Red Rock 1-3 times a week and today was the first time dealing with the bartender(shaved head, middle aged guy). Ive never had a bartender ignore me and then respond with a scowl and a nod. If you don‚Äôt want to work in the public then don‚Äôt.  Sad way to end my experience there.

This was a 4 star review(as read above). They charge $14 for a double caesar. Every time I‚Äôve been  before the servers bring out a tray with ketchup salt pepper and vinegar, the server for tonight brought out only ketchup and when I asked about the tray she informed me thats not how she does it. The bathroom was filthy and dripping wet like a cave with a paper towel roll  beside the sink, gross. This is the last time I come back."
Don't Yell At Me (Crowfoot),1,"The rich, business owners, or regulars who spend $ there are definitely taken care of more than others. It seems some people base your looks on how you're served or acknowledged. Other than that, good people/customers do go there. I hope it gets better. Will not be going back."
Dedicate Healthy Kitchen,5,I'm so happy we came across Dedicate in Mardaloop. We had take out and the food was delicious. It's fresh and healthy and we highly recommend. Thanks for the amazing meal!
Dedicate Healthy Kitchen,5,"We walked in and were greeted with a big smile and friendly ""Hello! How are you guys today?""

The ladies there are very friendly and the food was perfect for our lifestyle choices!

They gave us great recommendations based on what we said we can/can't eat and it was cooked to perfection. The chicken wasn't dry at all and the flavors were very good despite not using all the sugars and usual things restaurants put in their sauces to make them flavourful.

We definitely recommend this joint! Great esthetic, tastes healthy food and friendly staff!"
Dedicate Healthy Kitchen,5,"Love this place! The food is delicious, fresh,  and healthy. You can definitely tell high quality ingredients are used. Everything I‚Äôve ordered has been amazing. Highly recommend!"
Dedicate Healthy Kitchen,5,I get all my meal prep done by Dedicate and have for the last several months now.  I am in the best shape of my life and i attribute a lot of it to always having high quality food in my fridge that only requires a microwave.   The fact i don't waste money on food i throw out anymore is also a big deal for me.  These guys are awesome !
Dedicate Healthy Kitchen,4,"Good meal prep. I use weekly.

Super glitchy website though - can be frustrating when ordering. Took me 4 times and 30 minutes because the website would just glitch then I had to keep starting from the beginning. Then, when I tried to submit my order, it took 6 tries before it worked (usually takes 3‚Äì4 times before it will go through). Super annoying - they should look into improving the website and app."
Indian Accent - Kitchen and Bar,5,"First time in this Restaurant.
Sunday brunch was fun, they have Chana batura, different types of paranthas.
We all ordered Chana Baruta‚Äôs. They asked how spicy üå∂Ô∏è we want ?
Salted lassi had mint in it, was yummy ü§§
The quantity was so much I had to get it packed.
Chana bautras comes with pickles and onion and salad
The staff kept coming and asking how does everything taste. That was nice."
Indian Accent - Kitchen and Bar,5,"If you like Indian Food then this is for sure a place to go. The ambience is spectacular and the service is no doubt the best. We celebrated friends birthday today and had a really great time enjoying delicious dinner with friends and family. I highly recommend this place for food lovers.

Must Visit"
Indian Accent - Kitchen and Bar,2,"If you are looking for authentic Indian food, I can assure you this is not the right place. I think this place is really overrated & overpriced. We were a big group  & we ordered fish pakora, vegetable pakora, crispy chilli cauliflower & chaat papri as Appetizer.
Fish pakora, vegetable pakora& crispy chilli cauliflower were good but papri chaat was bit dry.
In the main course we ordered goat biriyani, shahi paneer, butter chicken, shahi patiala chichen, malai kofta, goat roganjosh & garlic naan. All the curries were tasteless specially malai kofta. Only naan was good.
Their staffs were very polite & their service was excellent though.
Plenty parkings are available.
Definitely not going back."
Indian Accent - Kitchen and Bar,3,"Went to dine in with couple is friends to this recommended restaurant. Food is ok. Masala chai lacked flavour. Was pleasantly surprised that the Saag actually is Saag and not Spinach (which many restaurants list as saag on their menu). We also had veg platter for the appetizers but forgot to take the picture. They definitely need to work on the quantity of that platter. Very small pieces of food for 18$ platter and the chutney provided for each bare minimum. Very disappointing. RasMalia was still frozen from the middle and the faluda was filled with noodles only. Other than not, not much to boost about. Normal neighborhood indian Restaurant."
Indian Accent - Kitchen and Bar,3,"I ordered off Uber eats and the butter chicken and garlic naan was very tasty - did wish there was more chicken especially because the butter chicken is almost $20 but still delicious. The only thing I had a problem with was the saffron rice. First off it doesn‚Äôt even smell like saffron and it doesn‚Äôt even taste like it either. Actually it was quite plain, not even salted almost. Was very disappointed with this as i was expecting saffron rice but instead felt like I received basic white rice that was food coloured with yellow dye‚Ä¶"
Cal City Pizza,5,"Last night, we had friends who were visiting us from BC. They wanted to try Vegetarian pizzas in Calgary and I had no clue where to order Good pizza. we were in Redstone and I googled and went to Cal City Pizza seeing their good reviews. I ordered Tandoori Pizza and Shahi Paneer Pizza. I was so relieved that I ordered from Cal City as friends from surrey had tasted so many great pizzas in surrey  But they were not disappointed as both the pizzas were Delcious and fresh. Must recommended pizza place if you like indian style pizzas."
Cal City Pizza,5,"To my mind, Cal City Pizza is the best pizza place in Calgary and there is not even a close second.
The first time I had pizza here, all I could think was how could it be so good. I went back 3 more time trying different pizzas hoping to find a bad one.
I had friends over and order 4 different ones to share the experience.
It is flavourful, not greasy, great size and competitive price. I feel like they made pizza healthy, if that is possible.
As long as I am in the city, they have a customer in me."
Cal City Pizza,5,"The customer service here is excellent but most importantly, the pizza is the best. We get the capicola pizza a couple times a month. Their curly fries and Thai wings are also delicious. If you‚Äôre in the area I recommend this as the go to pizza place."
Cal City Pizza,5,"I tried cal city pizza first time last week. It‚Äôs a must try pizza , what an amazing taste. I tried Tandoori Paneer n Cheesy cheese pizza, both were delicious and I would definitely go back to buy again. Perfect blend of spices üëçüèª"
Cal City Pizza,5,"Very impressed with their food quality. They take pride in their preparation and it‚Äôs totally worth every penny. Their pizzas are outstanding with less grease, fabulous flavours and great portion sizes. One of the best pizza places in town so far IMO. Love the fact that the my ask for their clients preference every time rather than dumping cilantro and ginger on every pizza. The two negative points (which is not their fault) is they don‚Äôt offer delivery and it‚Äôs a mission to find parking in this plaza."
Adobo Experience,3,"The staff are very helpful and welcoming, we had a fun time. They have a Karaoke stage.
Good for the group!
Food is a bit cold and dry because they prep for us before we came. so I‚Äôd like to try different foods next time!"
Adobo Experience,1,"We have a really bad experience ordering take out in adobo experience since me and my husband always order take out food and this time we order and takes more than 1hour to wait for our order and when it arrives it is really disappointed that our order was not complete only the rice and the cornsilog arrive but the seafood  platter dont arrive, When we call them they simply tell us to cancell our order for 1hour waiting and my kids was hungry  so instead of cancelling the order we decided to pick up the order by ourselves üò°The purpise we order for delivery is for our convience but the give us a hard time plus our gasoline the time and work and my kids that was hungry already the complementary drinks she gives is not worth itüò° The food was already cold when we pick up"
Adobo Experience,1,"The staff that serves us is not very polite and welcoming, they gave us attitude when we ask questions. The food is very expensive and they also make you pay for dining service which is so unreasonable because it‚Äôs a restaurant and the restaurant is responsible for paying the staff, the only thing we should pay for is the food and it is up to us to pay a little more for their great service but they make us pay for a dining service. Experience is horrible and expensive for basic service."
Adobo Experience,2,"It is true, if a place is empty go somewhere else. Was not the best experience but not the worst (close third). Portions are small with very little flavour. Feels like they are struggling to keep doors open and the presentation show they should just give up :("
Adobo Experience,2,"We enjoyed the food here especially the dinakdakan. So I decided to buy a take out for my family, but when we opened it at home the taste was different, it was bland, not spicy at all, cut was different, it even had a bone!!! and they use yellow onion instead of the red one like we had at the restaurant. Very different from what we ordered at the restaurant, my family was disappointed. It feels like it was rushed to prepare itüëéüëéüëé"
Chopstix Filipino Restaurant - Macleod SW,3,"Ordered their fresh lumpia. The lumpias were delicious and they are generous for the serving (3 lumpia for $12). Came during the dinner time, and place was super busy. Definitely think they need more staff especially the waiter/server. My food took 45 mins to be done and another 45 mins to have my food packed and pay the bill. I had hoped my lumpia‚Äôs were a bit warmer than what I had received especially for waiting that long. I had no problem waiting and being patient, however felt terrible for the server running everywhere.

Lost a star due to the rude comments by the owner on these reviews. Learn how to take the criticism and how to reply professionally especially when working at the business industry that thrives on customer service."
Chopstix Filipino Restaurant - Macleod SW,1,"A Disappointing Experience!!!

My recent visit here left much to be desired. The restaurant's lack of hygiene and poor service were major letdowns. To make matters worse, they served us a rice bowl with a hair on it.
This lack of attention to detail and food hygiene was unacceptable. Overall, I strongly advise against dining at as there are better options available that prioritize cleanliness, service, and food safety."
Chopstix Filipino Restaurant - Macleod SW,5,"Brought my parents to this place to try them out. They have a great menu with lots to choose from. We had goto, lomi, fresh lumpia and tocilog. It was good. The puto taste good as well as they use real rice instead of flour. Very friendly staff as well and very accommodating! I highly recommend."
Chopstix Filipino Restaurant - Macleod SW,3,"Visiting our friends from Edmonton and this was the closest Filipino resto to their place. We ordered an hour ahead and our food was ready when I got there. For the amount of food we ordered, I would say the value was worth it. You get the Filipino food staples like lumpia, bistek, kawali, and sisig. The lechon kawali we noticed they probably used peanut oil to fry it as it gave a distinct nutty taste to the fried pork. The usual taste for the kawali is basically that bacon-esque salty taste. With the nutty after taste surely gave it an edge. I'm not sure if this was intentional but I liked it. For sure this caters to the Filipinos who grew up with the food and the flavours. Not so sure if a person outside that culture would want to try it but I definitely recommend this place. The only downside was the fresh lumpia. There are so many versions on how this fresh lumpia is done and this was not the flavour we were looking for. Fresh lumpia is almost always difficult to catch that main taste. It is even challenging for me to exactly explain the taste in writing. I would shy away from ordering that.
I will have to update my review as soon as we can have the chance to dine in."
Chopstix Filipino Restaurant - Macleod SW,2,"I called at 11:07 am and arrived at 11:20. I received my order at 11:47. I called earlier but in total it took 47 minutes for one fried dish to be made. I‚Äôve ordered so many times before but this time when they made me wait, the lady server didn‚Äôt even bother say anything when she handed the bag. They just did not care. Not a ‚Äúthank you‚Äù or ‚Äúsorry‚Äù for me giving them business. I hope the service improves."
Win Fortune,1,Not going to lie worst orange chicken iv ever had in my life and me and my boyfriend got food poisioning from it. also it tasted like nothing and it was like eating a sponge.
Win Fortune,2,"$54 for this,, 2 orders of chicken balls, (hard crust soggy inside), and 1 beef fried rice, 1 chicken fried rice (2/3 the size they use to be). Not sure what happened to the sauce but it's terrible,,, not even the same color."
Win Fortune,1,"I‚Äôm not want to complain very often, but I need to give a negative review because this Hass to be the worst tasting Chinese food I‚Äôve ever tasted in my life and I love Chinese cuisine"
Win Fortune,1,"Wish I could give zero stars. Ribs were tough, chicken wings tasted like they were rotten, egg rolls were flavourless and the cherry sauce seemed to be watered down. Would not order from here again and I would never recommend."
Win Fortune,1,The pork here gave me and my girlfriend awful food poisoning. Will never be coming back.
Burger King #3579 (660 Notre Dame Avenue),1,"Are there no standards anymore!!??  This location is horribly run down, out dated, staff are not friendly or courteous.  It's tragic and appalling.  I actually love burger King, but clearly no one cares about standards anymore.  Even my whopper was a huge disappointment as you will see in the picture.  Barely had toppings and were not even the correct toppings.  It looked like they took whatever scraps were laying around and put it on my burger üò© I actually thought they were closed because there were no lights at the drive through menus infact there were multiple pieces of the signs missing! It looked abandoned and vandalized!  This is atrocious....please please do something about this!! üòû"
Burger King #3579 (660 Notre Dame Avenue),1,"If i could give less than 1 star I would. Waited in drive through for over 40 minutes. That is ridiculous. When asked, the girl at the window said""we have a lot of skip orders so it will take some time"" what is that about? I was physically there waiting for over 40 minutes. No apologies nothing. Just ignored us until the food was ready."
Burger King #3579 (660 Notre Dame Avenue),2,"Mmmh, aerosol-y.

... In case it's not clear, buddy is spray-painting mere feet from the food prep area.

Obviously poor judgement on the employee's part, but ultimately, realistically, the fault of management at this location who are too cheap to schedule off-hours maintenance, or temporary close for daytime work.

Also note the kitchen staff using *paper towel* as a makeshift mask, ostensibly because management is too cheap to provide PPE."
Burger King #3579 (660 Notre Dame Avenue),1,"Sooo

Food is good.

Coffee is cold, they literally put it in the microwave to heat it up.

Very slow workers. They walk around doing nothing but talk to eachother.

Literally if you come at 1030am you should expect to be served a hot coffee."
Burger King #3579 (660 Notre Dame Avenue),5,I like the service given by the girl around 12pm. She was very polite and was handling the delivery orders as well as front together. She had a big smile on her face. I see her almost every time i go there. I even told her that you should buy the franchise üòÖüòÖ
Pizza Pizza (52 Elm St),5,"Great Food, Though named pizza they even have sandwiches,  chicken wings and a wide range of other food items. The food quantity is great and so are the prices affordable for such great quality. Friendly and cheerful staff. Garlic fingers are a must try. Should definitely try if you  are just passing by and want something to eat."
Pizza Pizza (52 Elm St),5,Wonderful experience with new staff and management. It is a pleasure to use their food services . my experience has been made better from what it used to be many years ago. Kudos to new management for their efforts and hard work !! Must try everyone and support them! You won‚Äôt be disappointed:)
Pizza Pizza (52 Elm St),5,"The pizza üçï is always great!!  And price point is excellent for what you get!!  The manager that took our order was polite and eager to serve us!!  üëç üëç
But I think he might need his hearing tested.We were not the only customer he asked to repeat their order to him, do to the fact he could not hear us?  But he is a really nice guy!!!  üëç üëç"
Pizza Pizza (52 Elm St),5,"Excellent food, service and location. Whether we eat in or take out we are always very satisfied. A large variety of menu items and many specials. The seating area seems larger than it appears from the outside."
Pizza Pizza (52 Elm St),5,It was good expirience to be at the store. The new management has made great changes in menu and other things. The pizza of this store can rejuvenate anyones taste buds. Service and hospitality of staff is top notch. Also the ambiance of store can relax anyone and enjoy their food. All in all behaviour of staff toward costumers is very polite. If i am suggesting than everyone who are living near the store or away from store should visit or order food from the store . #best_pizza
Topper's Pizza (King St),1,"Not the pizza I remember. Terribly inconsistent, and too few toppings. If I pay for extra, I should get extra. This feels like asking for extra toppings at subway now.
Also, the chewy bread crust is the main reason for going here, but 90% of the time, it is overcooked and dry instead, now."
Topper's Pizza (King St),5,"Toppers is one of the factors that help me make my decision to move to Sudbury. First time I tried it it blew me away since I'm from a small town in northern Ontario called Hearst and we only have a few pizza places there, this was something different and special. 20 yrs later I still love it, although I order it might on the sauce every pizza and extra cheese and bacon, it's the bomb. Every Tuesday they have a special, you pay for a.medium and you get a.large, I always order, every Tuesday a large toppers ten w extra cheese, extra bacon and crust brushed w garlic butter and hold on the olives and mushrooms. Amazing food, highly recommended :)"
Topper's Pizza (King St),5,"I just had a delicious Montreal Steak Pizza tonight, and it was excellent, and the crust tasted great. In my opinion Topper's Pizza is still the No.1 pizzeria in Sudbury. For a good pizza, I stick to those that I like. If I'm not sure about a new pizza, I don't buy it. My biggest pet peeve about the other pizzeria in town, is they add a load of olive oil to the pizza and it make them soggy."
Topper's Pizza (King St),5,"It was a good experience here. Ordered through the app and paid in store. My food was hot and delicious. I ordered the square pepperoni explosion pizza well done for extra crunch, which certainly lived up to the expectations. The hours here are the best part. They are open late. Is this too hard to ask for In this town??"
Topper's Pizza (King St),3,"Growing up in Sudbury, Topper's pizza was a go to. Having recently visited, for Christmas, I ordered a Titan pizza. I've had it before, but never ordered it, personally. A cheese pizza was something like $22.99 That was a decent price. Any additional toppings were $4.00 each. Pricey toppings, but okay. When the pizza arrived, the driver was very friendly. However, the pizza was seemingly void of sauce, and dry. Not what I remembered. Sorry Topper's, but Domino's would have been a better choice that day."
Tony V's Pizza & Restaurant,5,"Just finished my first meal at Tony V‚Äôs and it was fantastic! I will definitely be back next time I am visiting in Sudbury.
Service was super friendly and efficient. Sister in law and I shared a jug of Strawberry Rose and it was delicious. Next up for the four of us was Calamari - perfectly cooked, Spicy Feta Dip - addictive, and Fried Dill Pickles - very, very good. No one had any complaints about their entrees, huge servings, fresh ingredients and just plain delicious."
Tony V's Pizza & Restaurant,5,"Amazing. Simply. The best wings in Sudbury, top-shelf service and great prices all around! Highly recommend this locally owned restaurant to anyone visiting Sudbury or residents alike."
Tony V's Pizza & Restaurant,4,"Decent restaurant! Had to make a pit stop in Sudbury and decided to try this top rated place. Overall, the food was nice and there are definitely a lot of choices for everyone, though my veal Parmesan sandwich looked a bit old and dry. It looks like a fairly busy place and so on a weekend, you will likely have to wait a while for a table."
Tony V's Pizza & Restaurant,5,Friendly atmosphere and generous portions. I had the chicken bruschetta pizza and hubby had spaghetti and meat sauce. We shared the lemon meringue pie. The service was beyond 5 star as our server was smiling and engaging. Will definitely be coming back! üòä
Tony V's Pizza & Restaurant,5,"A nice place to dine. I was greeted with warmth and an impeccable hospitality and an inviting ambiance that set the tone for a memorable evening.
The quality and presentation of the food were good.
I would highly recommend this place in search of good food and a memorable dining experince."
Rose Apple Asian Cuisine,3,"Went here for a quick lunch on pur way to Hamilton. Staff seems really nice and polite. But food was served warm, not hot enough. Soup are very cold. Not bad at all For the price."
Rose Apple Asian Cuisine,5,We dropped in a couple of days back and tried the cheese wontons and the chicken tom yum soup with rice noodles. The food was very tasty and the staff was super nice too. Definitely coming back for more
Rose Apple Asian Cuisine,5,"Always delicious.  The Beef Pho is divine! The beef broth is so, so good! I went in later than I would have liked (an hour before closing) and was still served super fast. In and out within 30 minutes!"
Rose Apple Asian Cuisine,5,The staff is always friendly. The food is always great and the price is fair. It has become a weekly dinner for us.
Rose Apple Asian Cuisine,1,"Went here one time. We just wanted some pho but the waitress said ""why not get the buffet, it is almost the same price."" I asked what that price was and she said $13. I was shocked as this is VERY low these days and I repeated it twice and twice she clearly said $13. We ordered several dishes and almost all were very oily and not flavorful. This wouldn't have been a total disaster until we got our bill for $62+tax. Turns out it was $31/person, not $13. We were incredibly turned off by 1) the lie from the waitress and 2) the quality of food. Will not be going again."
Red Swan Pizza (Sudbury Lasalle),2,"Pizza did not taste good. Amount of toppings was good. However, i paid extra to have both butter and regular sauce on pizza and it felt like pizza had no sauce on it all. All I could taste was mozza cheese. No other flavour."
Red Swan Pizza (Sudbury Lasalle),1,"I ordered 4 two topping pizza & I said add paneer and they said you have to pay more for it .I agree  with that. So when the order came I checked the order and three pizza were OK and other one has less quantity and 1/4 pizza has no paneer. I asked why it's  like that and they said what you got was what  you paid for. I asked them I would  like to talk with manager. Even manager  said the same thing to me
So my question  was - If I ready to pay for extra topping the. Why they do like this.
Manager don't know  how to handle the customer
Wrost customer service  ever."
Red Swan Pizza (Sudbury Lasalle),1,I have had pizza from this place twice. The first was Hawaiian there was no sauce and it was terrible. I decided to try again as it was my favorite spot in Toronto. I ordered barbecue chicken and again was disappointed.  Very little chicken no base sauce and absolutely no barbecue sauce don't waste your time or money
Red Swan Pizza (Sudbury Lasalle),5,First time trying Red Swan pizza and it won't be my last. Very pleasant server helped us choose from a wide variety of options. Super taste and flavour. Had to try a piece before giving review. Can't stop eating it now. üòã
Red Swan Pizza (Sudbury Lasalle),2,"The pizza is decent with lots of different options to choose from. However, the delivery service isn't very good. I had ordered a pizza that was scheduled to be delivered at 4:30pm. It was almost 6pm when my order finally arrived, with the pizza being lukewarm at best."
Pizza Hut (121 Loach's Road),5,"We had a wonderful experience at this Pizza Hut outlet. The staff especially manager Dinesh went out of his way to customize our order as per our requirements. Food, service and overall experience was 10/10. Will surely be back again!"
Pizza Hut (121 Loach's Road),1,My husband and I went to pizza hut for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. And we were very upset that it has been turned into what seems to be a fast food restaurant. We need to order ahead and our food came in take out containers with plastic forks and paper plates. Also to add I ordered a salad and quite a bit of the lettuce had gone bad (see photo). We will never be returning after seeing what this establishment has become.
Pizza Hut (121 Loach's Road),1,"worst pizza hut ever been two hours still no pizza , some reason they cant seem to make and deliver a pizza at this location anymore they take the order but wont deliver it, absolute worst pizza hut in the city i would say the country , would be hard to be any worse then these people , pizza dosnt show up or it shows up screwd up , made several complaint figured we had things sorted but her i am two hours later no pizza no email saying late nothing .dont order from here get from any other pizza place in the city"
Pizza Hut (121 Loach's Road),5,"Good food. What stood out most was the customer service. The person who was attending the counter was polite, respectful, and professional. Keep it up."
Pizza Hut (121 Loach's Road),5,"If you have a dairy allergy, not the place to go. I ask many times for my pizza to be cut with a clean knife and a clean area without drink contamination. They say yes and they still get contamination. People need to be more mindful with dairy allergies cuz it is a real thing"
Burger & Wings,5,"Have only had good experiences at this A&W, the staff are amazing which makes the dinning experience all the better and the food is the standard A&W quality.

It doesn't matter how busy it is, I am always pleased with the customer service from the staff, they are understanding and will take their time with a customer if needed.

This place is a little further but I prefer this location within Sudbury."
Burger & Wings,5,"Clean place with polite staff. Food was fresh, tasty and didn't take long. I highly recommend their sweet potato fries and chicken sandwiches."
Burger & Wings,5,"Super fresh and delicious food. Even though we have another A&W closer to our home we always choose to go to this one. The location is perfect in the New Sudbury shopping area. The store is clean and the food is always fresh. We go there at different times of the day and the food is great all the time. We might need to wait a bit for it to be ready but that‚Äôs because they make it to order. They have accessible entrance and accessible washroom as well as handicapped parking space. They also have a couple of tables outside that we use during summer. There is a huge parking lot and at the end of the plaza there is an LCBO. It is across from Silver city (cineplex). Also in the same plaza there is Marshall‚Äôs, Best Buy and Toys r us. It is a lively restaurant. I highly recommend it."
Burger & Wings,1,Annoyed. It doesn't matter what time I go into the location.  I always walk out before ordering because the staff is so focused on skip and drive through. üò†
Burger & Wings,3,"So excited for new croissant breakfast sandwich. Disappointed ate egg and bacon. Bacon always good. Coffee was better then I remember. Service ok. They admitted not a morning person, ha."
Gus's Restaurant,5,Amazing!!! First impressions of the restaurant was that it looked cozy and had a family restaurant feel. Like the recipes are authentic and possibly from a grandmother or relative. The smell of goodness hits ya in the face as you walk in and the waitresses are all very friendly! The food is to die for!!! ü§§ well done! I have a problem being able to eat and this food not only hit the spot but was made with  REAL ingredients... homemade Greek dressing and the tzaziki is garlicky and amazing as well! Well done! I would definitely love to come back again. The prices are up there but the portions are huge and again the food is well worth the money!!! Thank you üòä  also had the baklava but unfortunately my piece did not have much filling and it was kind of hard. Unfortunately my friend will never try that again.
Gus's Restaurant,2,"I ordered a club house sandwich expecting what was described in the menu. Chicken breast, lettuce, tomatoes and bacon with mayo.

When I received my plate, there was a tone of fries and my sandwich consisted of this:  Thick slice of toasted white bread, a thin slice of chicken (it was white and sliced like thin slice of ham), another thick slice toasted white bread, a tiny piece of lettuce (tiny, barely covered any of my pieces of the sandwich) a thin slice of tomato, a few pieces of bacon and another thick slice of toasted white bread.

The sandwich was dry as there was barely any mayo on it.

The plate came to a cost of approximately 16.95 (I can‚Äôt remember the exact price).

Most of my meal was left behind. I took all the middle sliced toast out of the sandwich and condensed the ingredients together. The sandwich was so small it would not have fed a five year old child.

This sandwich made me wonder if this was the reason that my plate was full of fries. Hide the fact that the sandwich was not worth two cents?

My husband ordered a filet of sole, he was also disappointed. He told me it was overcooked and very dry. He also asked what was up with all the fries?

Then came the  desert. My mother-in-law was raving about how good the rice pudding was.  She ordered and received her desert less then a minute later sprinkled with cinnamon.

I looked at it and could tell right away it was all wrong.  The rice was floating in a white liquid in the bowl.

My MIL, looked at me and told me it was awful. She was so sad.

On the positive side, our party of three had very good service and my MIL was able to catch up with old friends.

I went to a fast food joint for a burger after."
Gus's Restaurant,1,"Based just off Google reviews, we stopped by Gus's on our way to The Soo. Ordered the deluxe hamburger and lasagna. The burger was just horrible. A dry patty on an even drier bun toasted without a drop of butter or margarine. For $13, it's daylight robbery. Lasagna on the other hand was much better. For a restaurant that's been around for more than half a century, you'd expect to be run with integrity and pride offering food of the highest quality.

Our son was given a very dirty, sticky high chair with a broken buckle. Very unhygienic and unsafe."
Gus's Restaurant,4,"An old time Sudbury experience.  Not a fancy place in a nouveau part of the city.  Really good food, big breakfast, lots of coffee, working man style.  Server knows how to handle the clientele, keep them happy.  Hope it's always there."
Gus's Restaurant,5,"The restaurant is dated, for sure. But I couldn't ask for a better place to sit down, eat food and feel nostalgic for a moment. It's just like when I was a kid.

Also cool to be on the set of Resident Evil. Amazing"
Sub World,5,Wow. If you appreciate a variety of food this is your stop. Jumbo Shrimp you can choke on. The very best dumplings anywhere in town and you will not be disappointed. The largest wings I have ever seen and have eaten. This is a local business that cares about food. I eat there every day.
Sub World,2,"This used to be my favorite chicken caesar sub place.
Last night I ordered through DoorDash and was disappointed that you can't edit your options for your subs. I'm not sure who is responsible for that, if it's the restaurant or the ap. And the main thing the fam wanted was cauliflower bites but they were out of stock and got subbed for sweet potato fries without my approval. (I think that's an ap issue though). However, had I known that were out of stock I would have ordered elsewhere because that was the main thing we wanted.
The chicken caeser sub included sliced tomatoes which is both weird and gross to me, shaved chicken slices instead of grilled chicken breast like one would expect and dare I say too much of it. The bacon was burned; Luckily I like it that way, but not everyone does, and there was not enough dressing. The most surprising part though is the scant amount of lettuce in it. I'm including a picture, though it doesn't really show it that well.
We had onion rings that could have been cooked a little longer.
I also ordered the maple garden salad but it came with what I believe was a balsamic vinaigrette instead of maple. It also included shredded cheese (not listed as an ingredient) which I personally love, but my vegan family members didn't.
I ordered the maple chocolate cake and a nanimo bar. The cake was half frozen and dry and the nanimo tasted old.
The fam didn't say anything about the wedges so they must have been okay.
The poutine was pretty good.
I don't think I'll be ordering from there again which makes me sad."
Sub World,5,"LOVE this shop! The 12‚Äù meatball sub is so good, cheesy and hearty! With a good tip, it‚Äôll set ya back bout 15$ but sooo worth it. ‚ù§Ô∏è

The dumplings are plump and so good and stuffed with pork. Asian lady doesn‚Äôt mess around!
You can get 5 for 10$ and that includes the tip. On Wednesdays they have their 5 9.99$ dumplings deal where you get 5 dumplings with a pop and dessert.

You gotta try."
Sub World,5,"The food here is really tasty‚Ä¶clean and tidy‚Ä¶. Never miss my hometown when i am here.. and Staffs are too good with guest service which definitely is a positive for sub world.
Must visit restaurant in Sudbury. They have wide range of menu available and   dumplings and the there jumbo wings is a must try‚Ä¶‚Ä¶tasty and satisfying"
Sub World,5,"I'm not even surprised to see how many amazing reviews are here! I had moved to London for 4 years and craved sub world constantly. üòÇ They have the absolute best food, everything is incredible and always so fresh, fast and tastes like heaven. I order constantly and their consistency is EVERYTHING. They've never forgotten an item throughout all my uber eats orders and everything is always made how I chose. üëè I don't even leave reviews but everyone needs to know how unreal this place is. üëèüëè"
Taco Sol,5,"Good food, friendly staffs. Should try churros, i love ittt. And their burritos are definitely worth it!"
Taco Sol,5,"They say the rougher the part of town, the better the tacos. It's true, this place delivers.

The inside is bright and welcoming. The gentleman running the show is super friendly and a hell of a cook. I had the fish tacos, and churros for dessert.

I usually try and just bypass Sudbury when traveling, but I'll likely be stopping to grab a bite here from now on."
Taco Sol,5,"I was passing through Sudbury on my way home back to Toronto and stopped at Ranvee's to eat with my kids. Immediately the service by the staff was so friendly, and attentive!! He treated my children with such kindness, and I admired how he worked the cash, cooked, and served customers all with such ease! Clearly a hard working and cheerful staff member, and his warm demeanor made us feel at home. The food was hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious. You can tell it's made by hand and beautifully cooked. I would 10/10 recommend anyone to stop at Ranvee's!! I will go back whenever I am back in Sudbury. :)"
Taco Sol,5,Delicious food for very good price
Taco Sol,5,Always receive the nicest service here!! The food is amazing quality and they put so much effort into it!! You can tell they really care about the customers experience every time :)
Ranvee's Restaurant And Bar,5,Was doing a road trip from Toronto. Loved the vibe here. Had an amazing time with my people here because of staff being so nice and polite. They are very accommodating and food is absolutely delicious with reasonable price!! Must visit if you are in town.
Ranvee's Restaurant And Bar,5,The interior of this restaurant is so pretty ü§©. The food is too good and delicious ü§§. Mouth watering cheese sticks and poppers. Must try this restaurant if you are in Sudbury. Family atmosphere and so friendly staff. I would like to come again and agin here.
Ranvee's Restaurant And Bar,5,"Eat local. Support the non chain restaurants. Ranvees eatery on cedar Street is better than Excellent. Great food, The best wings in Sudbury. Pasta is good. Poutine is good. All made from scratch. Hidden gem. Go find it! You won't regret it!"
Ranvee's Restaurant And Bar,5,Our family ate at Ranvees last night and had a wonderful experience. Food was fresh and delicious. My partner and I both had Tinga Chicken Burritos and they were very tasty and filling (I had to take half home). Our youngest loved her nachos  and eldest loved her boneless wings. The churros for dessert were amazing! Staff were friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend this restaurant!
Ranvee's Restaurant And Bar,5,"I went here with ok expectations, but those were blown out of the water. When I got in the man at the desk was extremely nice and I ordered the kitchen sink. Everything was great but the taquitos were one of the best things I've eaten all year. Would recommend"
KFC (1341 Martindale Road),5,"Service was very frindly. Food very good.
Because we had to wait 10 minutes, did we get 4 cookies for free. Thanks!"
KFC (1341 Martindale Road),1,"Placed an online order, received the order after 1.30 hours when they guaranteed to deliver in 40 minutes. They charge $5 for delivery and deliver after 1.30. My both drinks are missing, 6 set of cookies are missing. Trying to contact the store more than 10 times on their website mentioned number but they don‚Äôt even care about picking the call. Pathetic service"
KFC (1341 Martindale Road),2,Skin used to be crispy and nice. Now it's mush and slides off. Fries are not very good as well.
KFC (1341 Martindale Road),1,"The WORST poutine in my life ü§¢ü§¢ cold gravy and soggy fries. I haven't tried the chicken but I think we'll stop at Wendy's in Espanola...

For $33 (poutine and 10 pieces
NOT IMPRESSED üò†üò†"
KFC (1341 Martindale Road),1,"U can t tell what the actual piece of chicken is,they re cut and double cut,the gravy is now just a brown gravy ,truely not the same,the Cornel is probably rolling in his grave for what Kentucky Fried Chicken has become ,,very very disappointed"
7 Star Dumpling House (Regent St.),5,"My wife and I were craving for some good Chinese food during our long road trip from east coast to west coast and we found this hidden gem online.  By looking at the pictures and dishes, I know it won't be disappointing.  We ordered the spicy sour soup, cabbage and pork dumplings, pan fried chicken and fennel dumplings.  The soup is 1 of the best I have ever had, and the dumplings are absolutely delicious! It's so good that we ordered extra dumplings and fried rice for the meal next day!"
7 Star Dumpling House (Regent St.),5,"Best Chicken Fried Rice and Sesame Chicken I‚Äôve ever had, the Mapo Tofu with Pork is rich, spicy, and delicious.

The waitresses were very friendly and helpful, and the one who cashed us out even packed our leftovers for us.

Wonderful establishment, great food, and great people. Thank you so much!"
7 Star Dumpling House (Regent St.),3,"Tried First time.

Chicken Fried Rice was bland. No flavour at all not even salt and pepper and chicken was chewy.

Noodles was Good though with tender chicken and nice mild flavour to it.

Not sure if i want to try next time."
7 Star Dumpling House (Regent St.),5,"What a pleasant surprise.
I travel for work and have been to many Chinese restaurants across the USA and now up in CAN. Hands down, the best Chinese food I've had longer than I can remember. Everything tasted fresh and reminded me of homemade food. I would come back in this area just to eat here again. I had the wonton soup,  fried crab wonton, pan dumplings, and dry fried shrimp noodles. I travel, so I got extra for leftovers for tomorrow, and I'm glad I did."
7 Star Dumpling House (Regent St.),4,"The boiled fish soup was good, very hot and filling. The portion is meant for two but I ate it all myself. Probably won‚Äôt order this again since the heat was achieved with dried peppers which I had to constantly pick out of the soup."
Cuisine Tropicale,5,We had the jerk chicken with spicy rice and plantain as recommended and it was awesome. Very spicy and super enjoyable. It‚Äôs more of a take out place rather than eat in though we did eat in restaurant. The food came out in take out containers and we ate with disposable cutlery. I would want to go again and try their other dishes.
Cuisine Tropicale,5,"Absolutely delicious! We got the griyo and jollof rice, jerk chicken and djon djon rice, and a soup for delivery.
Great price for the portions you get! The food is spicy but not very spicy and it's so flavourful. The meat is so tender too.

So happy I tried this place. Will definitely order again and dine in-person!"
Cuisine Tropicale,5,"Do not sleep on this place!
The owners were exceptionally nice and accommodating to our intolerances.
We enjoyed the fish and plantains. The star of the show may have been their coleslaw! Flavourful with a kick!"
Cuisine Tropicale,5,"We arrived late around 8pm during a really wet and gloomy Wednesday and were welcomed to some of the best service and hospitality I have had in a long time. There were 2 in our party and we order Jerk Chicken with Rice and Peas and Fried Fish with rice and peas. Let me tell you this Jerk Chicken was amazing! There's a lot of heat which should be expected when eating Jerk. It was moist and flavourful throughout. The fried fish was excellent as well crispy outside but glistening and moist on the inside. Both dishes fell away from the bone. Each meal comes with a large portion of rice a cole slaw a pasta salad and 3 fried plantains and a portion of sauce that mixed into my rice. The owner operator was friendly kind provided excellent service and wouldnt allow me to tip him so I promised I would return. If you're looking for authentic Afro-Caribbean cuisine head here, you wont be disappointed!"
Cuisine Tropicale,5,That had to be some of the BEST jerk chicken I have ever had.  The rice and salad complimented the chicken nicely.  The heat (spice) was perfect.
Wendy's (1015 The Kingsway),5,"The drive through attendants are so pleasant.  They are so friendly taking the orders and at each window, from paying to receiving the food.  They have always got my order right so far, which I am always impressed with.  The food tastes great.  It a bonus when they have good offers, such as the coupons. I go more often when the coupons are available, as I like a good deal."
Wendy's (1015 The Kingsway),1,Consistently displeased. I wouldn‚Äôt even come here if it wasn‚Äôt the only thing open late. Constantly missing items in the order or even toppings. The food isint made with pride just slapped together. They are skimping too much too. Little shreds of lettuce or half a piece of bacon. Constant let down. Price goes up service goes down‚Ä¶ üò¢
Wendy's (1015 The Kingsway),4,"Very good burger. Baked potato was a bit tough   but the butter and sour cream helped.
The store was about half full  but very clean.
Unfortunately the delivery drivers took up 3 of the limited parking spots.
Overall. Great prices for the best fast food in town as compared to Burger Slop  , McPukeles , etc. Lol."
Wendy's (1015 The Kingsway),5,"Same old wendy's. Food was good, service was good. Place is starting to look a little age, almost missed it because the don't have a big road side sign any more. Over all good personal experience."
Wendy's (1015 The Kingsway),5,"The young lady was great. She was so nice to my child, and the gentlemen standing next to help her was so kind. Big change since past experiences"
McDonald's (Kingsway),1,"My partner wasn't informed our order was ready in store and waited 10 minutes for it unnecessarily. It wasn't busy apparently, but besides that, he drove home with our meals and one of the Egg McGriddle sandwiches was made without egg or cheese. They also added cream instead of milk to my iced coffee."
McDonald's (Kingsway),4,"This location has very friendly employees each time I go. They're usually very good with my son as well, especially one who went above one time for a Donkey Kong Happy Meal toy for him."
McDonald's (Kingsway),5,"Food was good and made the way we wanted it.  Fries were hot which is always important for me and also just the right amount of salt which can vary from micky d's to another.

Again like I said about the other one....it's no longer a cheap place to feed the family but where is it cheap these days?!?"
McDonald's (Kingsway),5,"Had a great experience here for my son's birthday party today! I didn't know they still did birthdays and was pleasantly surprised when the manager said yes and they also decorated with balloons & streamers in his favorite colour, and had gift bags for the kids!! The staff are friendly and restaurant is kept very clean! Would definitely recommend for small parties!"
McDonald's (Kingsway),4,"Used the mobile app most times to order the food, less of a wait time. But over all pretty good üòä"
Okinawa Sushi Regent,4,"All you can eat serving.

Food is great. Additional meals outside the all you can eat attracts extra cost. It was my first time trying sushi so the experience was a good induction.

A bit pricey, cost $80+, dinner for 2"
Okinawa Sushi Regent,5,This is so good. I like how you order from a tablet and they bring what you ordered quickly and friendly. Everything I tried was delicious and I ate a lot! Definitely recommend!!
Okinawa Sushi Regent,4,"The server was annoyed to be working. We tried to be polite, but she just kept acting like all customers were an issue. She had glasses.  The other server was also helped was very cheerful. The food was good."
Okinawa Sushi Regent,2,"Normally we go to the Okinawa on LaSalle in smaller groups.  They couldn't accommodate our group this time, so 14 of us went to the Regent location.  We booked over a week ahead to make sure they could handle this size of group.

If I was rating this on their food alone, it would be a 4.  The dim sum was gross, which is why the food is only a 4.  I'm mostly disappointed with their service.

The staff were not very accommodating.  We asked for 2 pads to order from, one for each end of the table.  They refused. This made ordering extremely slow and confusing. Service went downhill from there.  Drink orders sometimes took a very long time.  The first order we put through had a dish that didn't come for nearly an hour.

All we needed was 2 pads to order from, it would have made a huge difference.

We spent a good amount of money (most of us were ordering drinks).  We won't be back."
Okinawa Sushi Regent,1,"Terrible experience at this restaurant. Attended dinner as a large party, the server was not very nice and every time she approached the table she acted as if we were an inconvenience. We were a louder table, I understand it wasn‚Äôt ideal but it happens with 16 people. The food was amazing so compliments to the chef. Bill time comes around and the server failed to tell us they added an auto gratuity. I‚Äôm all for tipping, but you are obligated to tell the table about the auto grat, because I tipped on top of the autograt totalling to 35%. I obviously asked for a refund so I can adjust my tip accordingly. Next thing that happened was a member of our party bought one bowl of soup and told them she wasn‚Äôt buying the all you can eat. They charged her for the all you can eat and refused to only charge her for the one bowl of soup claiming she never said she was ordering from the menu. They auto gratted her and she tipped on top of the auto grat because again, she was not informed, then tipping 30% on an all you can eat dinner she didn‚Äôt even have. This establishment really has no hesitation to try and scam people."
Little Caesars (1835 Regent St),2,"Very impressed with their pizza and new crazy puffs. Food was delicious, fresh and fast. Although, I was very disappointed in the atmosphere. I walked in to be ignored for the first 3 minutes as one of the staff stood there in front of me, then when she went to greet me, her coworker began to yell and bicker at her in front of me. Seemed as though they forgot I was standing waiting to pick up my order. As someone who is all about customer service, I was very disappointed seeing them speak to each other in the way they did. Very disrespectful and uncomfortable in my opinion. I recommend fixing the environment or I will be taking my business elsewhere for that simple reason."
Little Caesars (1835 Regent St),5,The best tasting g crazy bread out of all the stores we've patronized. They weren't cheating out on ingredients.
Little Caesars (1835 Regent St),1,"Little Caesars in New Sudbury is fantastic. But we decided to stop at this one today and what a disappointment. Not fully cooked, super chewy, and they didnt even put in effort to cut the pizza. Had to go home to cut it myself."
Little Caesars (1835 Regent St),1,"I used to ""work"" here and think about these guys a lot. When I was ""hired"" (in quotation because I was never given an interview, contract, anything, just called in for a shift) turnover rate was high. I asked a coworker and I THINK he said some senior employees quit due to pay related reasons. Anyways, It was my first real job and I had to be trained on everything as I was never actually given a job description, just expected to do whatever others didn't, so I did that for a few weeks. One day I was asked to clean a machine that literally had a warning on it saying that only trained operators should clean it, so (and this wasn't right of me) I didn't clean it. After a little bit I was asked why it wasn't done and I explained the warning and that I was never trained on it, I was kind of shown how to get it started and told to just get it done. That was strike number one with that manager.

Strike number two was when I was working an evening shift (not closing) and my shift ended so I clocked out and walked past the front counter towards the door, as I was about to head out the manager called out to me to do some other task and I called back that my shift finished and I have to get picked up. Yeah, after that I wasn't scheduled for any shifts, I asked why and the manager claimed I was being ""let go"" because apparently I was within a 6momth disciplinary period where they can let me go for any reason, and didn't have to tell me why. I wasn't told this at any point. I pushed for more details on why I was being let go as I felt I was doing a good job and the above two strikes are what I was told. Months later I think back on this employment with regret and question the legality of it. No kidding the turnover rate was high

Edit: Btw, we made the pizzas first, and set them on racks that weren't temperature controlled (unless you count flimsy flaps). If you ordered a pizza and it was already made on the rack we simply tossed it in the oven to be heated."
Little Caesars (1835 Regent St),3,Definitely wouldn't say hot and ready
East Side Mario's (Lasalle),5,"Our server was really friendly,  bilingual,  on the ball. He kept up with empty dishes,  on the refills for the all you can eat Cesar salad and free bread,  was very professional and courteous.
Can't remember this young man's name unfortunately but kudos on the great service. The food was fantastic like usual. I had the Hell's Kitchen Chicken and it didn't disappoint.
We had a great experience for my daughter's 18th birthday.
Definitely recommend!!!"
East Side Mario's (Lasalle),3,I dined in. I had dinner. I had the chicken parmigiana with spaghetti. Ambiance was okay. Super friendly staff. Lots of parking. Super chilled.
East Side Mario's (Lasalle),1,"I've loved coming to this place for years. This last visit was just downhill altogether.

Garbage everywhere, litter, even nail.
Soup was served cold and had to be redone.
Pasta served and asked and then got cheese 10 mins later."
East Side Mario's (Lasalle),4,"I'm always disappointed when a kitchen decides to put the end of lettuce in my food.  I had fun reading the Italian signs and realized there was a spelling mistake, so I guess Duolingo works!"
East Side Mario's (Lasalle),2,"We were a group of 7 out for my mother in law's 80th birthday.  We were seated and brought bread .  Had to request small plates and cutlery twice.  We ordered our food, which arrived quickly enough.  My pizza was warm but not hot.   Waitress was pleasant, but our bills were being brought to us while the birthday girl was still eating.  I couldn't believe it.  There was no one at the door waiting to be seated, so what's the darn rush?"
"Osmow's (2040 Algonquin Rd, Unit 13A)",1,We were driving from toronto to sault ste marie and reached sudbury at 9.45pm in front of osmows. We got off the car and the stare of the employee..it was a guy...from inside the store was enough to say that we were not welcome.  And his not so friendly attitude showed us that clearly when he stated that they are closing at 10pm.  I understand that but it shud specify not accepting orders after 9.30pm if someone really wanna go home earlyüòÖ.  We would have gone somewhere else.  Anyways we chose to ignore the guy and ordered our food anyways since we were hungry and that was our last stop for food and had to drive 4 hrs more.  The food is delicious.  Portion is great...well worth the price.  I would love to stop by next time but hope to be greeted with better customer service.  I assume the guy wud be the owner or manager koz they are the only people with zero customer service in a food business as per my experienceü§£.  We ate our food in the car and some friends had to eat out in the cold but that's our badü§£üòÅ
"Osmow's (2040 Algonquin Rd, Unit 13A)",5,This is the place for delicious shawarma. The price is reasonable and you get a variety of toppings to choose from. Also some interesting beverage choices of Osmow's different juices.
"Osmow's (2040 Algonquin Rd, Unit 13A)",5,"Food has been consistently good at Osmow‚Äôs. I had the falafel wrap. It was filling and tasted fresh.

The only thing I‚Äôd say could have been better was the wait time - it took about 10 minutes to make. But I‚Äôll wait for a good product any day.

I‚Äôd definitely recommend checking out any Osmow‚Äôs you find if you‚Äôre looking for a consistently good take out food place."
"Osmow's (2040 Algonquin Rd, Unit 13A)",4,"Food was very good ‚Äî I like that when they say spicy, they mean it. I don't love the flavour of their hotter sauces, but they go well with the shawarma.

One staff member, a young woman, was very polite, but the young man that took our order was rather rude. When he was asking for details about the order, he spoke quickly and quietly; when I asked him to repeat himself, he took a very annoyed tone but spoke at the same volume and speed.

Maybe they ought to turn down the music a bit, or talk to their staff about enunciating when someone can't hear them properly."
"Osmow's (2040 Algonquin Rd, Unit 13A)",5,Fantastic food. Very fresh. Friendly enough staff. The building and atmosphere is unremarkable. Very happy with the large chicken shawarma and the falafel. Will definitely return.
Herbert Fisheries,5,"Best Fish and Chips Anywhere

I work with a small Coast Guard buoy tender, Caribou Isle, and we always make sure to stop here for the delicious fish and chips. They use fresh caught whitefish which they catch themselves. Whitefish does not have a fishy taste as with other types of fish, this makes the deep fried  fish and chips taste so light and flaky. I am originally from Nova Scotia and can say without hesitation that this is the best fish and chips I have ever had! I just wish I could drop in more often than once every few years :-)"
Herbert Fisheries,1,Surprised it was a fast food type place. Wondered why I included a tip on the bill since all they did was bring the food. You must get your own disposable cutlery and condiments and clear your table. Fish had a light batter but had no flavour. Fries were no better. Very disappointed. Will not return.
Herbert Fisheries,1,"If I could I would rate my experience at the Sudbury location a zero star rating! My boyfriend and I went to try it out for the first time, and our meals were absolutely disgusting!
The fish had no flavour, the veins were still in it and had no flavour. The fries were not good either very greasy, no color or salt.
But the worst of it is I got very sick. I threw up my fish and I felt incredibly nauseous!
DO NOT GO TO THE SUDBURY LOCATION. YOU MAY GET SICK AS WELL!"
Herbert Fisheries,2,"Good, the bad, and the ugly on Fri Jul 5

FIRST: Most of the reviews and the photos here are incorrect.  They are for the other original location in Killarney. This location is in a dingy land locked strip mall plaza NOT near water with no exterior seating.  NOT the quaint free standing building shown in some photos.

GOOD: The fish was GREAT!  We came here because local trout and pickerel are the fish they use, not haddock or halibut like you usually find.  Lots of smaller pieces lightly battered.  Decent amount of fresh cut french fries.

BAD: Sticky tables and slow service.  Was told 20 min, but ended up being 40.  I don‚Äôt mind being told it‚Äôs going to be longer for fresh made, but let‚Äôs be honest.  It would be better if they actually outlined on the menu what type of fish you were going to get, since people typically expect halibut.  Location and decor are poor.  Prices are also much higher than average.

UGLY: So this is what destroyed our experience.  I split open two different pieces of fish and brought them up to the cash to ask the guy what type of fish each of these were.  He proceeds to pick it up and poke each one while telling me what they are.  This is right after handling the cash!!!  I was shocked!  Now if that‚Äôs what he did, I was worried what things were like in the back.  Let‚Äôs hope the cook‚Äôs hygiene was better.  This is why I hate tipping at the cash when you first purchase."
Herbert Fisheries,5,"Went here for the first time, we were excited when we found out they have pickerel dish and chips.
The fish and chips had to be one of the best I‚Äôve had...the pickerel filets were perfectly battered and fried, crispy. There were fresh cut fries....who eats fries when there is perfect t fish.
I wish they made their own tartar sauce."
Damascus Restaurant,3,"Absolutely love this restaurant! The food is amazing. Although pretty disappointed with the family of 5 wrap order. Says it comes with fries for a family of 5. Pretty sure you get more fries when your order a single wrap. The chicken wrap is amazing, that's just not enough fries for 5. Order a second order of fries if your doing a family of 5 wrap order. Cheers."
Damascus Restaurant,5,The absolute best and most authentic middle eastern food around. Fresh made to order. Hands down best falafel and only place I‚Äôve been that is made to order. The staff is extremely friendly and if you‚Äôre not sure what to get just ask they have great recommendations. 10/10 can‚Äôt go wrong!!
Damascus Restaurant,2,"I‚Äôm really disappointed with the experience at this restaurant.
I went there and ordered falafel plate which comes with veggies and rice that costs about 17$, and my colleague ordered chicken shawarma which is about the same cost, the falafel was saggy and kind of not fried very well, my colleague complained about the chicken is blank taste or tasteless, moreover they gave very little amount of veggies with the plate, also not enough rice for the cost. It‚Äôs overpriced honestly, I was still hungry after I finished my plate, my colleague was hungry too. We ended up by snacking a lot more after that dinner. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll return back anymore."
Damascus Restaurant,5,Alhamdulillah‚Ä¶.I had tried beef shawarma with rice and food was delicious.
Damascus Restaurant,5,"I‚Äôve eaten here twice. The food has always been impeccable. The service is always genuine and relatively quick for the made-to-order food.

The pickled veggies are awesome texture and flavour added to the shawarma. The baklava is an awesome change of dessert options for Canadians looking to get a taste of something different.

The family that operates Damascus is known for giving back to the Sudbury community and is deeply representative of what Canadian values should be."
A&W (2404 Long Lake Rd),1,"They keep messing up my drive through order lately. I just want my burger lettuce wrapped.  Gluten allergy.

Update: had an area manager contact me via email. I admire the customer service the area manager provided and his attempt to make things right.  Unfortunately the store on my next visit messed my drive thru order again.  I'm confident this store will improve in a couple months a d my review WILL change when service from this store changes."
A&W (2404 Long Lake Rd),5,"I've only been to A&W twice now, but it is great food nonetheless. I got the chubby chicken sandwich and it was pretty good. Decent chicken patty, but the peripherals was where this sandwich shined. The bun and sauce were of a caliber not often seen at fast food restaurants. All this and an atmosphere to boot. Despite most fast food places going for a more modern aesthetic, A&W hasanaged to stick to that classic diner feel. Overall, great food, and a great vibe to go along."
A&W (2404 Long Lake Rd),4,Flavor was good but I had to remove quite a bit of topping to make this burger appealing and edible. A little less lettuce would have been perfect :)
A&W (2404 Long Lake Rd),1,"If your drive through is closed put a sign up, also why in God's name can you take an order inside but not outside your saying you can't put the order through on another till and just serve me in drive-through? Is it that complicated? If I had the physical capability or the time to go inside I would've but instead another morning where a&w has some issue and I can't get some food, why are you even open if you won't serve customers?"
A&W (2404 Long Lake Rd),4,This is a clean and well run a and w with fresh food every time I've been. Recommend.
Shoeless Joe's Sports Grill (Regent St),1,"Disappointed and upset that the waitress was so long, waited to be served 15 from the host nobody was in front, went I ordered the apps she didn‚Äôt even give me the proper things needed for my app (sauce) then when I asked for some it took forever cause she knew I was upset. Then took 25 minutes to serve us our food, and give me the dip. I didn‚Äôt eat the pickles that was served and I told her I wanted a bill cause the service wasn‚Äôt up to par. Then she continued questioning me asking me if I ever worked in a restaurant‚Ä¶ like seriously?! Considering I have made it extremely worse. Still paid for the pickles and it was a really big price just for an appetizer. If anything she should have said the pickles are on us cause we messed up but she just continued to ask me with the bar lady if I worked in a restaurant. The waitress had tattoos and long brown hair and the bar lady was blonde"
Shoeless Joe's Sports Grill (Regent St),5,The garlic dill pickle fries are next level amazing! Fun and friendly atmosphere! Service was great! Lots of tv's so you never miss a game no matter where you are sitting!
Shoeless Joe's Sports Grill (Regent St),1,"We went inside and was waiting for the host the host didn‚Äôt even come to the front for 15 minutes, then we were put at a table ordered our appetizers everything was fine asked for a couple more minutes. later the appetizer arrives pickles with no sauce then the person who served us didn‚Äôt even come back to check in on us. The host served us the pickles so we didn‚Äôt know where our server was we waited 25 minutes to get served our meal to tell her what we wanted. I asked for the bill and said that it was unacceptable service that she didn‚Äôt come check on us. Then she brought the bar tender and asked me if I ever worked in a restaurant and fought with me instead of just saying sorry. Worst time and I was on a date."
Shoeless Joe's Sports Grill (Regent St),5,"We arrived after a long road trip just 20 min before closing. The manager Jay was extremely accommodating . We not only got our fav drinks but also some food !! The bartender was amazing as well. Elisa was friendly and poured us our drinks.
What a great experience,  we will be for sure back when in Sudbury"
Shoeless Joe's Sports Grill (Regent St),1,"Was there Friday 30th June.  Took close to 40 to get appetizers, ordered a slovike bowl, and was supposed to come with a bed of jasmine rice. No rice, I told the waitress, she was very polite at first apologizing, went to the back came back and said it at the bottom of the salad, I told her twine no rice e is there. I took out all the salad places it on a plate show it to her. Again she apologies and said the chef said it's there. To the end of my stay at the restaurant, I did not herd an other word from anyone.  Given a bill to paid for a meal Idid not get. I paid with out any hesitation and left.  Not sure if because I am a brown person and was from out of town. I will warn any visitors to be aware of there services and treatment."
Herc's Greek Eatery,5,"Great food, but the service was lacking. Was also overcharged for the meal based on their lunch special, and there was also a hidden fee on my bill. After several minutes, one of the other employees reversed the unusual charges and charged me the correct price.

Come here for an amazing meal, but watch your bill closely."
Herc's Greek Eatery,5,"Went through the drive thru and ordered two chicken soulvaki dinners. Good price for lots of food, everything tasted great. Also tried out the fattoush salad, it was delicious and fresh. Good quality food, great portions. We were very happy with our meal. And the baklava cheesecake is amazing! Our server was great too üôÇ"
Herc's Greek Eatery,5,"The food here is unbeatable, truly one of my favourite ever restaurants. From the potatoes to the rice to the salad everything is seasoned perfectly and the chicken shawarma pita wraps are incredible. 11/10 would recommend to anyone in Sudbury. No other Greek place I‚Äôve tried even comes remotely close."
Herc's Greek Eatery,2,"Ordered gyros, was not pleased. They use those nasty frozen donair instead of using the vertical broiler you can SEE in the kitchen. Tsaziki was meh, runny and not flavourful. Rice and potatoes were dry and lacking in flavour.

On the plus side, the staff were rather nice. But they -seriously- need to work on the quality of food items."
Herc's Greek Eatery,2,"Good food, and service but a ridiculous $3 for more dressing for a salad that had barely any on it.  Never had to pay so much to enjoy my food.  Won‚Äôt be back."
Red Lobster  (1600 LASALLE BLVD),5,"Excellent service despite an extremely busy Mother‚Äôs Day weekend. Our server was efficient and friendly. The front desk staff were very accommodating with reservation mishaps and many people waiting.

Get the Brussels Sprouts üëç"
Red Lobster  (1600 LASALLE BLVD),2,"Much more was expected from this $50 plate of food. Dry lobster, tiny amount of mashed potatoes and the most dry/ hard to chew rice I have ever had. The other thing ordered was the the shrimp special which was good, hence the 2 star rating."
Red Lobster  (1600 LASALLE BLVD),5,"Today was my first time ever at a Red Lobster, it surpassed all my expectations. They greeted us warmly and the restaurant was very clean and tidy. Our waiter, Scott was fantastic. He gave excellent suggestions on choices of food and drink, he even brought over some wet naps and was kind, friendly and social. The food was excellent, the drinks were tasty. We got a ""Have a great night"" on the way out from the manager and the staff were smiling. I will definitely be going again. I, highly recommend this location. Excellent."
Red Lobster  (1600 LASALLE BLVD),1,"Ordered takeout on Friday, November 11th 2022.  I ordered escargots which arrived completely cold to the point where the cheese solidified and I was left with a gross mixture of mushrooms, escargots and garlic butter.  I ordered a kids chicken finger meal with Cesar salad.  The chicken fingers were again, very cold.   The lettuce from the salad was so rusty, I'm not even sure how it left the chicken.  I also ordered a make your own combo with 2 items with the admirals shrimp and shrimp linguini.  The shrimp again was super cold.  The linguini was okay.  However, nothing was very appetizing that I ended up not eating much.  Submitted this same review through the Red Lobster website and I have yet to get a response.  Super disappointed.  I ordered through Skip the Dishes and the driver was very apologetic about the delay in delivery and I reassured him that I did realize it was Friday night during dinner.  I wasn't expecting a fast delivery but I was expecting at least a quality meal.  I realize the restaurant was busy but maybe they should limit takeout and delivery orders to make sure what goes out is at least of decent quality.  And while I realize that I could just warm up my food in the microwave, the Cesar salad was the final straw and I had lost my appetite.  This was an 80$ order that went down the toilet, literally."
Red Lobster  (1600 LASALLE BLVD),3,The dishes look delicious but the amount of salt put in almost every single food is too too much! I had to dip my lobster in my water to lessen the salt. Would not come back again unless they change to healthier salt and fat amounts.
King‚Äôs Way Buffet,2,"Possibly the most depressing buffet I've ever been to. What little selection there was had been sitting a while and was dried out. The waitress was super friendly, but the selection and quality of food set the tone for the whole experience."
King‚Äôs Way Buffet,2,"Went here yesterday... food was terrible. It's the first time I've been here in years. Everything was cooked in so much grease or butter. I had one tiny plate of food before my stomach could handle it anymore. I don't find there was many great options... I get the bill and it was 45 bucks for that... was not impressed that not only could I not stomach most of what was there, but the food was also cooked in super old grease that made most of it look dark brown in colour. I will never go back here. That was the first time ever that I didn't tip my waiter. So disappointing."
King‚Äôs Way Buffet,3,"We haven't visited this establishment in about 3 years.  We were disappointed in the variety of foods available!  The menu has certainly been 'robbed' of the more expensive selections.  But the price has gone up!  Service was excellent.  Place was very clean.  Food was tasty and fresh.  But, again, the selection has been cut back.
No sushi, Prime Rib, Crab legs, etc.
I don't think we'll be back."
King‚Äôs Way Buffet,5,Went with a neighbour to the buffet. Excellent food with a wide selection of items and a peaceful atmosphere. We will be back again soon.
King‚Äôs Way Buffet,5,"First time I‚Äôve gone and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed.  They had a small Buffett as it was a Tuesday but you could have ordered off the menu as well.  Service was amazing ! Highly recommend.
I will have to return on a weekend to see the full buffet."
Kwik Way (Bancroft Dr.),1,This is not a pizza place but a machine that prepares pizza. False advertising.
Tim Hortons (885 Notre Dame Street),1,"Very rude staff, they only know they have orders to be quickly processed and forget the custyas human being. They treat as if we go there to ask for a favour. Same treatment by the order taker as well as food processing ladies. Very unfortunate, one of the very rude staffed Tim Hortons that I have visited"
Tim Hortons (885 Notre Dame Street),1,Never ever order at night in this place they dont know how to serve and treat customers. We have ask for 4 drink and 2 of drink where made wrong we ask to remake it old lady ignored and ask to leave building or she will call cops to just make us leave. Those tims are cheaters and they don‚Äôt have guts to serve customers in polite or with kindness. We have asked for receipt she told me i will not give you receipt. After telling 3-4 times she has put receipt on window and told me to leave this place.
Tim Hortons (885 Notre Dame Street),2,"Asked for a quencher as they looked good on the menu board. Was told to go to LaSalle and that they only have iced caps. I mentioned they shouldn't have it on the menu board. Was told, with snark, talk to corporate. So here goes:  Hey Tim Hortons corporate. Your front lines are getting angry about people ordering what's not offered at their location. Customers are getting snarked at. Across the board does not always work."
Tim Hortons (885 Notre Dame Street),5,they truly tantalize the mouth hole with their coffee and snacks.  really just a tremendous time.  top notch.  couldn't have been more happy.
Tim Hortons (885 Notre Dame Street),3,"They usually get my order right, however I hate how busy the drive through gets. There is one real nice lady who usually makes my day she's so chipper and happy I love it when I hear her voice when I place my order."
Churchill Convenience,5,"A-MA-ZING! Our server(I believe her name was Sam) was awesome and the food was fantastic. I had the Cajun Haddock Fingers and oh my goodness‚Ä¶. They were to die for. I usually don‚Äôt enjoy tartar sauce but I really enjoyed it. Everyone in my party devoured their food and we somehow managed to fit in desert! The Nanaimo bars are very rich and coconutty, perfect with a cup of coffee. And the sugar pie was creamy and sweet. I wish I lived closer because this would be my regular spot. I can‚Äôt recommend it more!"
Churchill Convenience,2,"First time at this establishment. There were 4 of us, so we all got something different. The deep fried macaroni balls were very starchy and plain. The artichokes and spinach dip tasted like mayonnaise. I asked the waitress if it wuz in fact made with mayo and she said ""no, but had complaints from other people saying the same thing. The burgers were ok. The ceaser salad wuz very disappointing. It tasted like kraft!!!  Then to top it all off, my glass of juice had someone else's lipstick mark on itü§¢. It wuz not mine cause I wuz not wearing any!!!"
Churchill Convenience,5,Excellent atmosphere food and service. Recently held a surprise party for a 90th birthday with 25 guests. We were able to use the cabin room for a private atmosphere and a wonderful homey feeling. Every guest raved about the food and our waitress was outstanding. Really made for a wonderful celebration and a unique experience for the southern Ontario guests. Well done MIC Highly recommend
Churchill Convenience,5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Sudbury right now. Friendly staff, great service and the atmosphere is relaxed. The restaurant interior is clean and always looks fresh.  Even though it's not explicitly on the menu, I asked for a garden salad and it was no problem - and it was delicious.  Their maple vinaigrette dressing was perfect."
Churchill Convenience,4,"We went to M.I.C. with friends, and wanted to have a good evening, the food was delicious, but the service was not the best. The best thing I liked about MIC was the atmosphere. Very good vibe in the restaurant."
Trevi Bar & Grill,2,"We were here about a month ago, a group of us on a Friday night.  Around the time karaoke starts.  We took the round table near the stage.

The server refused to clear the table (it was dirty from the previous people).  So we piled all the dirty dishes and glasses in the middle. They stayed there the full 2-3 hours we were here. We also never received any service, we went up to the bar for our drinks. I was told I had to pay cash (I've run a tab here every other time, just let them hold my credit card).  I watched others run tabs, and when I asked why, the bartender made a joke of it.  The staff was rude and abrasive.

It was just a really poor experience. It seemed some customers received better service than us, but I got the impression they were regulars.  I'm not rushing back, which is unfortunate since the food was good the last time I ate here."
Trevi Bar & Grill,2,"Was disappointed in the poutine,  had way too much pepper, fries soggy.  Great cheese curds!  I was too shy to return it.  Awesome waitresses.  I won't return until a new cook is hired üòÜ  Was also disappointing that we had to watch horse race meanwhile the Maple leaf was playing on a tiny screen far from our party."
Trevi Bar & Grill,4,Lacks a bit of ambiance and in need of a desert menu a huge lack of desert options next to nothing but the food is outstanding.  I have never had a bad meal there.  Their soups are the best i've had.  This is not your greasy spoon diner.  All home made !
Trevi Bar & Grill,4,"Great food. Had a staff party here, was a weird assortment of food in my opinion but everything was delicious and the staff was great. Although they did accidentally start two tabs for me haha but it was sorted out easily since I only had two drinks."
Trevi Bar & Grill,1,Terrible food. Insane prices. The smallest most mediocre sad excuse of a poutine costed over $16. Extremely disappointing. Be prepared to be disappointed
Burger King #4923 (809 Victoria St. North),1,Would give 0 stars if possible. Slowest service - they only take 1 order and don‚Äôt take the next one until the first person has their food and is gone. Today I received a burger with only cheese and bacon and no other toppings. No one answers when you call the restaurant.
Burger King #4923 (809 Victoria St. North),3,"A friend and I attended this location for the first time tonight.  I ordered a Whopper Combo with iced tea.  Fortunately, as my order was being prepared, a fresh batch of fries was added, so they were nice and hot.  The hamburger proved to be a typical Whopper....served at room temperature and somewhat mushy, although it is one of the last full-size hamburgers available in an industry that has reduced their burgers to no more than a kid's meal size.  The restaurant itself had a strange atmosphere, as the parking lot and the interior of the place were very poorly lit.  Everything was so dark we thought it was closed as we approached.  The equipment visible from the counter looked old and in rough condition.  This location is in need of a complete makeover.  Overall, I did get what I paid for, but it's not a restaurant I would dine in a second time."
Burger King #4923 (809 Victoria St. North),3,"Nice staff and convenient location. Impossible Whopper was good but can easily be made at home once available in stores. Lots of parking, drive-through was pretty busy."
Burger King #4923 (809 Victoria St. North),2,"It took 20 min for 4 cars to order at drive through. The operator just disappears from the com for a minute at a time. The patty tastes burnt, properly didn't clean their grill. Gave me 1 piece of napkin for a 3-people order"
Burger King #4923 (809 Victoria St. North),3,"First mobile order. First impression unfortunately not the best. I'm a Ketchup lover and ordered extra Ketchup on everything.

Unfortunately there was no Ketchup at all. Thankfully the food was still great tasting or I was starving. Very tasty food. That's the only reason I'm giving them three stars.
Considering the fact they didn't get my order correct, I think that's fairly generous :-)

The fish was great. Although there was a bit too much tartar sauce when I asked for light tartar sauce."
Pizza Express Stirling,5,"Absolutely love this place, it has become my go to for pizza. The staff are always super friendly greeting me and have always been very speedy with service, don't think I've had to wait longer than 10 minutes when going to order for pickup. Quality is also elite! They use great fresh toppings, not too much sauce and the perfect amount of cheese. Will be back soon for sure!"
Pizza Express Stirling,5,"They have such a wide variety of toppings to choose from, their crust is super tasty, and the garlic dipping sauce is a house favourite. The pizzas are consistently amazing and when we order for parties, everyone can get pizza they like cause of how many topping options there are. Love em! Our new go to pizza place."
Pizza Express Stirling,5,"We used to go to a different pizza place but found they didn't cook the dough through so we switched places. We found Pizza Express and it's the only place we order from. The people remember our orders, which are usually the same, lol, and are super friendly when we call. We usually pick up and they are always on time with our order! Love that they make my little guy gluten free pizzas!"
Pizza Express Stirling,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Pizza Express, and I must say, it was a truly delightful experience from start to finish. The combination of their delectable pizzas, warm and friendly staff, and inviting atmosphere made for a memorable evening.

First and foremost, let's talk about the star of the show: the pizzas. Pizza Express truly knows how to craft exceptional pies that are a perfect blend of flavor, quality ingredients, and artistry. The crust was perfectly thin and crispy, with just the right amount of chewiness, and the sauce was bursting with a harmonious balance of tangy and savory notes. Topping choices were plentiful, and each ingredient was fresh and thoughtfully selected. From classic Margherita to adventurous creations, every pizza I tried was a true masterpiece that left me craving for more.

What truly sets Pizza Express apart, however, is their exceptional staff. From the moment I entered, I was greeted with genuine warmth and hospitality. The waitstaff was attentive, knowledgeable, and passionate about the menu offerings, making excellent recommendations and ensuring that all my dining preferences were met. Their enthusiasm and dedication to providing outstanding service truly enhanced the overall dining experience.

The atmosphere at Pizza Express was cozy and inviting, with a vibrant yet relaxed ambiance. The restaurant's modern and stylish decor created a welcoming environment that was perfect for both intimate gatherings and larger celebrations. The attention to detail in the interior design further added to the overall enjoyment of the meal.

In addition to their outstanding food and service, Pizza Express also impressed me with their commitment to quality and consistency. Every visit I've made to Pizza Express has been consistently excellent, with the same high standards maintained across their various locations. This level of dedication is a testament to their passion for delivering an exceptional dining experience to their customers.

Overall, Pizza Express has truly won me over with their outstanding pizzas, attentive staff, and inviting atmosphere. Whether you're looking for a casual family dinner, a date night spot, or a place to celebrate with friends, Pizza Express is the perfect choice. I highly recommend visiting Pizza Express to indulge in some of the best pizzas you'll ever taste, served by a team that goes above and beyond to ensure your satisfaction."
Pizza Express Stirling,5,"Got a take out special, 3 toppings on a large pizza for $12.99. Pizza came out quickly, great amount of toppings on it. Came with a dipping sauce at no extra cost too. Employee working was very friendly. Pizza itself was good, not too greasy, good flavoured sauce and a nice crust. Will go back again"
SMK African Foods Inc,5,Very friendly service and great selection of African products! Currently the only location I know of in Kitchener-Waterloo that sells Cassava flour and white corn meal. I will definitely be coming back if/when I need more of the usual African starches!
SMK African Foods Inc,4,"Great place to shop for food stuff from Africa. I was very happy to find a lot of things from Nigeria- Peak milk, Nido, yam, maggi, curry to name a few. If you're looking for African products, this is a good place to visit. They also sell meals but I haven't tried those yet. I hope they expand and bring even more stuff from Africa."
SMK African Foods Inc,5,"The owner is really kind and is always happy to see me. Pretty decent hair selection, and the plantains are always ripe :)"
SMK African Foods Inc,5,SMK is my No 1 store for African Groceries. I love it Love it Love it!!!!!
SMK African Foods Inc,5,For your African especially Nigerian cooking needs. It's home away from home.
Galito's Flame Grilled Chicken (Kitchener),5,"The Peri Peri fries are absolutely delicious! And the wrap I got was fantastic too, will definitely be coming back to try more things!

The employees were kind, they were patient with me deciding what I wanted, and even warned me when I ordered a very mild wrap and the rather hot fries together, to be sure I knew the hot item was hot, which was very considerate!

0 complaints =)"
Galito's Flame Grilled Chicken (Kitchener),5,"Great food options for lunch. Not much seating, so take out is likely necessary. Food is made well and fairly quickly. Food can be quite spicy if desired."
Galito's Flame Grilled Chicken (Kitchener),5,"My husband and I went tonight and had a great meal. The food was excellent - super tasty, fresh, and abundant. We got our chicken ‚Äúhot‚Äù and the amount of spice was just right, a good amount of kick but it didn‚Äôt burn your mouth. If you‚Äôre not into spicy food you can also get a mild spice level as well as extra hot. I got  the combo with 3 drumsticks and my husband got the chicken skewers. Both were delicious. I highly recommend the piri piri potatoes as a side dish, they were super tasty! We will definitely return!"
Galito's Flame Grilled Chicken (Kitchener),4,"Excellent food. Ordered chicken strips and rice with the lemon herb sauce. So delicious! However, I wish there was better seating for eating in."
Galito's Flame Grilled Chicken (Kitchener),4,"Tuesday burger special is a great deal given the portion size. Decent size burger and lots of fries (peri peri fries are great!). Toppings and taste are easy 4/5, value 5/5 for this meal. The rest of the menu is still a decent value, too, though I haven‚Äôt tried most of it."
Bao Sandwich Bar,5,"The food was delicious we got great chicken bao, korean garlic chicken bao and the kimichi fries with beef it was so good. The fries were so crispy and every bite tasted delicious definitely will go back, only downside is it's a little hidden but still worth the adventure."
Bao Sandwich Bar,4,"I tried the Buffalo Chicken Bao & Wacky Tacky chicken Bao here. The taste is really good and the chicken was tender and fresh! The Bao was fully loaded and these 2 are the spiciest chicken options available there. It serves as a single piece and might not be sufficient for a single person so rather pair it with fries and drink or get 2 of them. The place has a decent amount of seating.
My only concern is that it was rather difficult to find this place as it is located in midst of a residential area and is underground so it's kind of hidden. The worst part is that there is no parking space available Incase you want to dine in as the parking outside this place is for the residential area. You would be really lucky if you found parking on the street!"
Bao Sandwich Bar,3,"This is a decent place to grab a bite. However, given the quality and taste of the food, it‚Äôs overpriced. Tried the Chicken Katsu, Thai Yum, Seoul Beef, and Kimchi Fries with Beef.

The meats are on the sweeter side and don‚Äôt really leave me with wanting another bite. The chicken katsu could use a stronger marinade, Seoul beef was very sweet, and Thai yum had a nice taste. The kimchi fries were great and the highlight of the meal. Fries were nice and crispy and the beef was flavourful!

At nearly $8 per sandwich, it‚Äôs not my first choice. Worth the try though!"
Bao Sandwich Bar,4,"This place is literally a hole in the wall. Cute, small little place that is easy to miss but a great find!
All the food is delicious so far! Always hot & fresh and made to order. The staff is friendly and helpful for first timers.

Literally only docking one star because it can be hard to access. It is right in the heart of the Waterloo/Laurier campuses and there is no parking for the restaurant. You have to find street parking or pay to park at a lot. Also, if you go during a busy time it may be hard to get a seat as there is about 6 tables and a few bar stools.

Otherwise, it is well worth it! Plan accordingly for peak/busy hours in the area or just get takeout!"
Bao Sandwich Bar,4,Been going here ever since they opened and food never disappoints! Nice selection of bao and banh m√¨ choices as well as unique sides. Prices have definitely gone up in the past several years but worth what you pay for.
Burger's Priest (Waterloo),4,"Very good cheeseburger. Thick, nice slice of warm cheese on fluffy, warm bread - perfect. Devoured in minutes. Sauce ratio could be much better. Meat didn‚Äôt have any smoked taste and could have been slightly thicker. There could have been more veggies. Overall, felt much better than a typical burger fast food joint!

Recommend!"
Burger's Priest (Waterloo),1,"The poutine was horrible. Bitter, dry and burned. I don't think they ever change the oil for those fries.ü§Æ. The og cheeseburger was mediocre at best. You are better off eating at McDonald's or make it at home . Will definitely not return."
Burger's Priest (Waterloo),2,"Ordered food for takeout for our family last night. On our way to pick up our order, got a phone call from a staff member letting me know that one of the burgers would not be an option and asked if they could sub out another burger. I said fine even though it is not something I would ever willingly order but as we were on the way to pick up and had already paid, that was the choice I had to make. I was asked if I wanted my new burger dressed the same way and I said yes.

When we arrived home with our food, the burger that was swapped out was not only dressed wrong but completely inedible so ended up in the trash. My 12 year old could barely get through his burger as well; said it was soggy. The only redeeming food was the fries. Would definitely not go back to this restaurant as the price of the burgers definitely do not match the quality. A real shame for a place with burger right in their name."
Burger's Priest (Waterloo),4,"We ordered curbside pickup for lunch on a Sunday, getting two Impossible Burgers and a side of fries.

The Impossible Burger patty was VERY convincing as a beef substitute. I could easily serve this at a BBQ and no one would know the difference unless I mentioned it. It was REALLY cool. Scarily accurate. Try it!

However, I don't know if I can recommend Burgers Priest because of other factors:
- I paid $1.50 for cheese and didn't get it
- I added tomato, pickle, and ""vegan sauce"" (basically a mustardy secret sauce). The toppings were a letdown...not enough of each one, and one of the tomato slices wasn't ripe. In my photo I've pushed everything to the front to make it look better. Next time I would order a crapload of toppings to make the ratio of toppings to bun/burger more proportional
- fries were VERY well executed but also very VERY salty. If there's a way to order low / no added salt next time I would."
Burger's Priest (Waterloo),3,"I went for lunch and was greeted by friendly staff. The space was clean. The prices were significantly higher than other burger joints. I was disappointed with the flavour of my double cheeseburger with bacon. It was incredibly greasy, not in a good way. It was also very salty. The quality of the ingredients were above average but I wasn't happy with how they were used. I'm interested in trying another dish or franchise location."
Boardwalk Burgers Fries & Shakes (Waterloo),5,"We came in for a late lunch meal on a Sunday. Less crowded during this time, which is great if you arrive starving. There's a wide selection of sandwiches that can be ordered a la carte or as a combo. The amazing thing about this restaurant is you get your order, exactly as they look on the photos. Everything tastes great too. I liked that the burger patty is juicy, not dry. I can say that my kids enjoyed their sandwiches too, and ate them as is with the lettuce and tomato, which they would usually remove. The dining area is clean, as well as the washroom. They have tables for big and small groups too. Service was amazing, and we received our food freshly cooked and promptly. We're definitely coming back."
Boardwalk Burgers Fries & Shakes (Waterloo),5,"Went to this location in Waterloo on a Sunday. This Halal burger joint is hidden in a strip mall behind Tim Horton‚Äôs. The restaurant was very clean and the service was amazing. The cashier turned out to be the owner who was very friendly. We ordered the Swiss Mushroom burger, with chilli fries, a spicy chicken burger and a couple of shakes. Everything was done perfectly and tasted really good. There were other items on the menu that we would be trying at our next visit. Another good  thing is that they are open late everyday. Definitely recommend."
Boardwalk Burgers Fries & Shakes (Waterloo),5,"The Foods are great! Our favorite was the Mushroom Swiss Burger! Excellent! üëçüèªüëçüèª The Chicken Wings are delicious! The Fried Cheesecake are also delicious! We also like the Mocha Cappuccino Shake & Cookies in Cream Shake üëçüèªüëçüèª The owner is very warm & accommodating! The place is neat & clean! Highly recommended! They serve Halal, Gluten Free! Students with ID gets 15% OFF! They also have delivery service just call them at least a day ahead! üöö ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
Boardwalk Burgers Fries & Shakes (Waterloo),5,"Best halal burger and wings I had! The food quality is great, tried 4 of their burgers and they all taste great. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Highly recommended üëå"
Boardwalk Burgers Fries & Shakes (Waterloo),2,"burger craving not satisfied! Was excited to try this place however did not have a great first experience.

We Ordered four burger combos (various burgers) and one childrens meal‚Ä¶. $90 later, we felt so ripped off‚Ä¶.

*beef Burgers - meat was tasteless, condiments didn‚Äôt add much taste.
*Fries - cold, soggy and cups were inches from being filled (as pictured)
*Kids cheese burger - pictured on child size plate. Quite small compared to the cheese slice, and didn‚Äôt have ketchup or pickles as requested
*sweet potato fries - is this even a full serving?
*child size  up broke down and leaked all over counter top after 45 mins. Large cups seemed to be better quality and didn‚Äôt have same problem.

2/5. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm keen to try any other menu items."
MrBeast Burger (1120 Victoria Street North),4,"Ordered via Uber Eats in Waterloo, so it is a bit of a drive for the food to get here. We ate immediately when the food arrived.

The Good: The Beast Style Burger was meaty and delicious. Bun was toasted. I had a Double with added sauteed onions.

The Bad: They put Cheese when I marked No Cheese, which ruined my daughter's burger. I can't personally order from here again, it's too expensive to waste so much money on a burger she can't eat.

The basic fries cold were not good - waste of $5. Perhaps without such a long drive in the middle they might have been okay.

I was happy to have tried this place once since the burger was good."
MrBeast Burger (1120 Victoria Street North),5,"100% WORTH if you love big burgers that will fill you up.

For anyone that is trying to find it. Its in Casey's gril. Ik wired but you walk in and there's a separate area inside.

Drove 45mins to try the Mr beast's beast burgers.

It was the best burger I have ever had and GF had the chicken burger and she Loved it toüòÅ.

It is on the expense side but dose fill you up."
MrBeast Burger (1120 Victoria Street North),2,"The burger was fast food quality and the fries were below fast food quality, at high school cafeteria quality, but all for a higher price.  All of the well-advertised ‚Äúcrispy beef patties‚Äù were definitely not crispy.  But we like MrBeast so we wanted to try it."
MrBeast Burger (1120 Victoria Street North),1,"The fries were awful and soggy, my fianc√© and my burger was terrible, just greasy with no ketchup or mustard. I cannot believe we just paid $60 for two burgers, one fry, and a coke. Most disappointing meal I‚Äôve ever had. Honestly, all we could do was laughüòÇ"
MrBeast Burger (1120 Victoria Street North),1,"We ordered last night and were very disappointed. Fries were cold and hard, the burger was dry and overcooked. The only person that really enjoyed it was my seven-year-old son who was just excited to be eating something from a YouTuber. My dogs enjoyed it the most. I would‚Äôve been better off eating at McDonald‚Äôs if I could give no stars I would"
Pizza Pizza (185 King St. W),5,Poutine is my all time favourite! The one i ate here had an amazing blend of sauces and crispy fries! Its a must try if you are a french fries lover. Great place to hang out with friends! The new owners also joined us for a few minutes. Cool couple.
Pizza Pizza (185 King St. W),5,"Great atmosphere as the store has a spot-on location just opposite to the Kitchener City Hall. The New Owners are very patient, friendly and easy to deal with. All in all, the best Pizza store in Kitchener-Waterloo region !! Highly recommend it to everyone."
Pizza Pizza (185 King St. W),5,This pizza place is really good and affordable too. Yummy pizza with good and clean dine in options is a perfect combination. I would definitely visit this place again.
Pizza Pizza (185 King St. W),5,"What a great experience! Truly fantastic food and service. I have been to other pizza pizza locations but this one is the best one so far. I had a quick chat with lady on the front counter while picking up my order, found out they are new owners. This is going to be my new go to place on DTK"
Pizza Pizza (185 King St. W),5,"The first day of new owner of pizza pizza, they offer an awesome range of fresh pizzas.
I liked to dine there.
New Staff members are friendly, prices are reasonable and the spot is always kept clean."
Mei King Restaurant,4,"Decent sesame balls, they are small golf ball size, could be a bit bigger as they are $6 for 6 of them plus tax so almost $8. Staff is super nice. Decent amount of parking, which you turn into right off Victoria. Small place, not open for dine-in at the moment."
Mei King Restaurant,5,"I've had takeout from here many times (never dined in) and it always hits the spot! Especially on Friday evening after a busy week. The food is always delicious and the portions are very generous. The food in the picture made three meals for my husband and I.

The staff are great too; always pleasant to deal with and my order is always correct."
Mei King Restaurant,1,"My daughter ended up with a piece of metal in her mouth from the Chicken Lo Mein, it appears to be from a scrubbing pad. That along with the bone in a piece of chicken in our gui ding leads me to believe that quality control measures are lacking at this restaurant."
Mei King Restaurant,5,"Food is delicious, never disappointed with the food from here. The gravy is amazing. Service is always good too best Chinese food around!"
Mei King Restaurant,5,"My family and I just had the dinner for 2A and we are very pleased.
The place looks very unassuming but that is because the true effort is put into the food. This is traditional Canadian Chinese food done right.
My son and his dad loved the chicken chop suey and they had the best sweet and sour chicken balls I‚Äôve ever had.
Friendly staff who take pride in a clean restaurant and good food.
Will be back next time we want Chinese food!"
Red Swan Pizza (Kitchener North),1,"We got pizza two nights ago and are honestly not sure what we were given, the picture will speak for itself. One pizza was perfect, the other looked like this... We always give the restaurant the chance to rectify it themselves before posting a review but they just had no interest in making us a new pizza, they just kept arguing with us. Also it's not cheap, it was $27 for one. It was our new favourite because of their vegan options and we had been recommending it a ton on our vegan instagram page as well! Sad this happened :("
Red Swan Pizza (Kitchener North),1,"Expect to get burnt Pizza (butter chicken flavor) with owner's justification that they have recently changed their sauces so Butter Chicken should like this (Burnt). Owner refunded the money however he was failed to accept the mistake and was keep justifying the burnt Pizza with passive aggressive behavior.

We have been their old customer but it's time to search for a different Pizza place in Kitchener."
Red Swan Pizza (Kitchener North),5,"I was very pleased with the food. We ordered a tandoori chicken pizza and butter chicken pizza.
I overheard that they also take vegetarian/vegan/dietary restrictions very seriously. As in they cook their pizzas in dedicated pans.
Everything was prepared fresh, especially the dough.
You won‚Äôt find better tasting and unique pizza anywhere else. It was cooked perfectly. The staff were very pleasant. The area is also kept very clean. I recommend dining here without a doubt!"
Red Swan Pizza (Kitchener North),1,Ordered the pizza 20 mins ago on the app and then waited at the store for over 30 mins. There is no pizza place out there which takes this much time. I ordered Spicy paneer pizza and it was the worst pizza I ever had. The base sauce was so sweet that it didn't go well with the toppings at all.
Red Swan Pizza (Kitchener North),1,"Terrible experience. Thought we would try a new pizza place and this place had some interesting options. We were told 20 minutes when we ordered and we went to pick up the pizza twenty minutes later but it wasn't ready. We were told 10 minutes more, and our order would be ready. 10 minutes later, now 40 minutes after I placed the order originally. I was told that it would be 5 minutes, or 10 minutes, or 15 minutes more at this point (already 25 minutes late). I asked if I could simply cancel the order at this point, since I wasn't even confident my order had been started, and they said no. I don't mind waiting an hour, but if it's going to be an hour, tell me that up front. Was super excited to try this pizza everyone is talking about, but we will not be back here again no matter how good the pizza is."
Top chicken,5,I really liked the Fried chicken.. first time tasting the Korean fried chicken .. soy garlic chicken was juicy and taste very good .. even the kids liked it very much . The surprised package was the cheese corn which is very good and it is a must try option in appetizer.. the staff are friendly and courteous..
Top chicken,2,"While the food was not bad, the overall experience and service has made me not want to go back here. We went on a Friday night so I do understand it being busy, but the lack of organization was a little silly. After being seated it was over 30 minutes before someone came to take our order- we didn‚Äôt even get water, and the employees were somehow always busy with something. We ordered the soy garlic and cheeseling boneless chicken (which tasted pretty good although the chicken itself was a little dry), and the honey butter French fries. It was another 20-25 minutes before our chicken came out, and by the time we were done eating our fries still hadn‚Äôt came so we cancelled the order. Overall the large chicken still fed two people pretty well, and our total came out to around $40."
Top chicken,4,"I totally recommend the deep fried chicken and cheese corn here, really good. Pickled radish is just okay, and the steamed egg is not really recommended. The steamed egg tasted like nothing to us, no flavour. Overall pretty good, just won‚Äôt order the steamed egg again"
Top chicken,5,"The food, side dishes and service are really good. We had rose rice cake and 1 whole chicken for 5 people but we couldn't finish everything. Serving size is big. It's 18% tip for 5 people but it's worth it for the great service. I haven't had such great service in so long."
Top chicken,5,"Although they don‚Äôt have much tables, their chicken is very juicy, tasty, and crispy. I love the cheeseling and soy honey wings! Y‚Äôall should try their corn cheese and honey butter fries too. Great place to get chicken and beer. Overall, 10/10."
Bianca's Pizza,5,"I came to know about this stunning restaurant through Uber eats. They have deal on 2 large pizzas with a three topping including potato wedges and wings . There was an option in potato wedges and Caesar salad. Plus 2 drinks. Omg what a deal. Their quality and quantity is awesome, really liked the food . Chicken as a pizza topping was so juicy and fresh .Moreover, one garlic bread was also complimentary."
Bianca's Pizza,5,"I've gone here for basically 5 years. I only get an XL Cheese pizza so my review is limited in application. But I LOVE their pizza. Their price is good, their pizza is amazing, and they are always nice when I come in. Pizza is pretty cheesy so if you don't like that then that's potentially important but I'd still recommend them.

Also their dipping sauce hits different"
Bianca's Pizza,5,"Ordered online for take out. Easy to check out as a guest and surprisingly robust ordering system. Took about 15 minutes for it to be ready which is pretty quick. Like that you can get thick or thin crust, extra sauce without extra charge. Price is very good and really good value. Uses really good quality toppings, and lots of them as well. Sauce was tasty, crust was nicely textured. Contactless payment available, and employee working was super friendly. Will go back again!"
Bianca's Pizza,4,"Tried Bianca‚Äôs for the first time and absolutely loved it! We ordered pizza through their website and used their 2 medium pizza with 3 topping deal. On one pizza we got olives, banana peppers and mushrooms and on the other, we got chicken with jalape√±os. We also ordered their creamy garlic drip. The chicken and jalape√±o pizza was my favourite since the  chicken was super flavourful and they gave quite a few pieces. Would definitely recommend!"
Bianca's Pizza,5,"Wow here is incredible! Reasonable price, feel like home food. Homemade garlic dip has a good flavour. I always pass by here, and I just felt pizza tonight without any expectation, but this is so amazing. Gives me comfort from hard work. Thank you!"
Quick Sandwiches (King St S and Town Square),4,"Came by this place almost at closing time but the staff was really friendly and patient. Ordered the New York steak sandwich and it was served very generously. Also had the grilled chicken and it was good, but if you‚Äôre ordering it in a baguette make sure to get double meat as one portion doesn‚Äôt cover it well enough.
Very generous servings with the vegetables but a bit confusing since they don‚Äôt tell you you can only have five. Everything tasted very fresh and overall had a good experience!"
Quick Sandwiches (King St S and Town Square),1,"The person at the restaurant was rude. He was hurrying us through the order even though the place was completely empty. We ordered Philly Cheese Steak sandwich. What he gave us wasn‚Äôt Philly cheese steak at all. It didn‚Äôt even have cheese in the first place. Ultimately, we had to throw the sandwich away because the meat in it was old. Go there if you want a bad experience!!"
Quick Sandwiches (King St S and Town Square),5,"Great place for a quality sandwich! They take so much more care than a place like Subway/Mr sub. The bread is actually quality  bread, not the cheapest thing you can slap meat onto.
Seating is comfortable and plenty of natural lighting from corner windows."
Quick Sandwiches (King St S and Town Square),5,"There is no doubt that Benjamin (the owner) is the undisputed King of Sandwiches in the Tri-Cities. Despite long odds, the eatery has survived an extremely harsh retail environment in Uptown Waterloo over the last few years (LRT construction and COVID), and today it is thriving! While there are lots of strong reviews of the sandwiches here, one item that is underrated are the Salads! Ben and his Associates will craft you the biggest, freshest salad you've ever had with as many toppings/veggies as you want. If you haven't tried one yet I highly recommend it! And yes, Ben has a colourful personality, but if you want bland, go to Subway (for taste and for tact). Come for the sandwich/salad, dine-in for the entertainment! Cheers,"
Quick Sandwiches (King St S and Town Square),1,"The owner is disrespectful and rude. His berry smoothie tastes like orange juice, which isn‚Äôt a pleasant nor satisfying taste. He said ‚Äúthat should keep you cool for 3 seconds‚Äù after he handed me the smoothie. I‚Äôll take that 3 seconds and go somewhere else!"
Later Pizza (Waterloo),4,"Really great food. Crust was great and it was super fresh and hot. Garlic dipping sauce was the star, but also pricey. Got some free donuts as well, which was so lovely and it was my first time there. Pretty pricey ($26 for a 16"" pepperoni, $2 for dip), and no place to sit. Cool theme."
Later Pizza (Waterloo),5,no words. best pizza ever. i‚Äôve gotten my friends in going here because it‚Äôs by FAR the best. like seriously worth the extra $ also the staff are so sweet!! A MUST!!
Later Pizza (Waterloo),2,Ordered the Macro Mushroom and Meet Chimi. Both looked pretty overcooked. The Meet Chimi was pretty disappointing. It was greasy and bland. No actual chimichurri on the pizza. Just parsley leaves. Definitely not worth $21. Will not be ordering from here again.
Later Pizza (Waterloo),5,"Best pizza you'll get in Waterloo. Also have really good donuts and sandwiches. It is a more pricey option than others nearby, but if you're just getting a slice its worth the dollar more."
Later Pizza (Waterloo),5,"I had the pleasure of trying Later Pizza in Kitchener, and I have to say, it exceeded all my expectations. Their pepperoni pizza is simply incredible - the crust is perfectly crispy, the cheese is perfectly melted, and the pepperoni is full of flavor. It's clear that Later Pizza uses only the freshest and highest quality ingredients in their pizzas, and it really shows in the taste.

But what really stood out to me was the outstanding service from the manager, Paulina. She was friendly, knowledgeable, and truly went above and beyond to ensure that my dining experience was perfect. From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and taken care of, and it's clear that the manager sets a high standard for customer service that the rest of the staff follows.

Overall, I highly recommend Later Pizza to anyone in the Kitchener area looking for a delicious and memorable pizza experience. Their pepperoni pizza is a must-try, and the service is some of the best I've ever experienced. I'll definitely be coming back for more!"
Five Star Shawarma and Pizza,5,"Pizza was amazing as always!  We got the Chicken Shawarma with tomato base, regular crust, garlic sauce on top and spicy mayo on top.  Absolutely delicious!"
Five Star Shawarma and Pizza,5,"Just ordered 1 Chicken shawarma, 1 Butter Paneer pizza with Indian option and 1 Butter paneer pizza‚Ä¶ just loved the taste‚Ä¶ freshness and the sauces are out of the world‚Ä¶best in Waterloo Region‚Ä¶"
Five Star Shawarma and Pizza,5,"I like Pizza.
But most importantly, I like good Pizza!! And even more so, Superior Customer Service.
May I introduce you to my new favorite Pizza Place in #WaterlooOntario
#5StarShawarmaandPizza
585 Weber St N #4 Waterloo, Ontario
Conveniently located by #Fit4Less

The slice may look typical...but obviously as the old phase goes, looks can be very deceiving.
Biting into the pizza is the first introduction into something is very special, the pizza shell doesn't have the typical cardboard/drywall texture, *it actually has a consistency of dense but fluffy naan bread (I tried to compliment the staff the other day, but I think a language barrier just made it seem like an insult). Let's take another bite, there's something different, something out of the ordinary, chew it a bit more, move it around the tongue... Right!! It's the sauce!! It's not the basic open the typical pizza sauce...yes, it's homemade!! With spices and garlic added!! Very nice!!
Now, let's nibble on the Pepperoni, something is different again, a bolder taste, less greasy...ohh it's Beef Pepperoni!! What a relief!! Pork is an unhealthy animal and protein to consume (for many various reasons, that I encourage others to do their own personal research on. *Just like Us, Swine also store their toxins in their fat, and what do we consume most of in the Pig??

Even though I haven't had their specialty Pizza yet, like The Butter Chicken Pizza or obviously the company name Pizza Shawarma, I certainly smelled it's lovely essence.

Highly recommended @5StarShawarmaandPizza

Five Star Shawarma and Pizza,2,"I have been there way too often and it keeps getting better‚Ä¶.

The above statement was from 3 years ago. I was there earlier this week. It looks like it‚Äôs under different management. The prices have gone up significantly, which I totally understand. However, I paid for me meal and when I asked for pickles and turnip on my shawarma plate, she said, ‚Äúyou have to pay extra for those.‚Äù So my shawarma plate was without pickles and turnip‚Ä¶a standard topping. I‚Äôm hoping this was a mistake but I‚Äôll doubt I‚Äôll be back to find out. My order was almost 19 bucks, see pic below. The food was okay, on par with cheaper shawarma places but I can‚Äôt really judge because those two toppings are key to the dish IMO. Also, the raw chicken on the spit was unappetizing."
Five Star Shawarma and Pizza,3,"Had chicken on the rocks with turnips and pickles, when it arrived there was barely any garlic sauce from what I'm use to from other places, the rice was nice and fluffy but other than that everything else was normal. The pizza sub had patches of nothing from bite to bite and the tabbouleh isn't even tabbouleh it's just giant cubes of tomatoes and onions sprinkled with parsley flakes."
Cheez-Us Pizza,5,"Nice new place to taste your buds out crazy.

Awesome üëç Pizza taste and aviety of them to choose from  + Sides

Great customer service üëçüòâ

Loved the Pizza
Go grab some currently 50%off deal until it lasts lol ü§†"
Cheez-Us Pizza,5,"Wow!! This pizza was amazing! Heavy, filling pizza with flavorful toppings. Cooked to perfection! Price was great too! 50% off on build own pizzas on Mondays with code Mon50. Deliver was fast (45min) and food was piping hot! We will definitely be ordering from here again! Ordered 2 larges and garlic cheese strips. So much left over because it's so filling! Try it for yourself, you definitely won't regret it!"
Cheez-Us Pizza,4,"Amazing deal today July 1/23 medium 3 topping for $4.99.....so I had to capitalize only thing was I don't understand why they would put a limit per phone number... Made no sense to me if I want to order 10 let me order 10.... I only order 4 but I had to use my Sons phone number,..I don't think they realized the response from the signs they put up....pizza was decent, kids liked it....but run of the mill and what you would expect"
Cheez-Us Pizza,4,We decided to give the Chicago pizza a try. We had 5 people try it and we had one person who didn't like the crust and another who wanted less sauce. The rest loved it but didn't know if they would order it again. We also ordered a large 4 topping and that went over very good. The cheese bread went over amazing and everyone loved it.
Cheez-Us Pizza,5,Have been looking for a place with pepperoni cups and the char pepperoni Cheez-Us had available was perfect. Their pizza is amazing quality without needing to be fancy. Toppings are abundant and their wings were not breaded but still large compared to most restaurants with breaded wings nowadays. They have their own delivery drivers who followed all delivery instructions and had our pizza delivered without any concerns. We would definitely order from here again if we are craving a high-quality pizza for a good price.
Mary Brown's Chicken (700 Strasburg Road),5,"Ordered a spicy feast and I was met with exceptional customer service that went above and beyond expectations, unlike other locations the seasoning was applied very well. The staff was extremely attentive and very friendly, highly recommend this location over any fast food chicken in south western Ontario."
Mary Brown's Chicken (700 Strasburg Road),2,"Took a friend who is a big fan of Mary Brown's. I was underwhelmed.
I ordered the Big Mary sandwich with wedges on the side. Food was ready very quickly and the friendly server brought it to our table.
Sandwich was a decent size, bun was fresh, right amount of condiments and garnish. Chicken breast was over cooked and dry. Very chewy. Wedges were cooked perfectly, crisp outside, creamy inside, but super salty.
Overall, it wasn't the worst fast food I've had but far from the best."
Mary Brown's Chicken (700 Strasburg Road),5,"I think they have the best chicken sandwich in town. Tried all - Nashville Mary, original, spicy and buffalo.. all of them are superb in taste and excellent chicken quality. No comparison with others similar food chains - One thing is pretty much clear, Popeyes are not even close to this, it is highly recommended to eat here before you go any other food chains. It‚Äôs just they are lacking in marketing otherwise they should beat others easily. Customer service is top notch, keep it up guys!"
Mary Brown's Chicken (700 Strasburg Road),5,"Order #6294
My husband and I came into the store to buy their chicken. No matter which Mary Brown location we go to the quality is always the same, and that means the chicken is always good. The staff at this location were really friendly and the restaurant was clean! There is enough space to sit several families. Honestly this chicken is the best fried chicken in the city!!! One time we went KFC to get their chicken and compare and it was nothing like Mary Brown chicken. KFC Chicken is so small and dry even when freshly cooked - and when I say small the portions are half the size as Mary Brown portions per piece of chicken. Also, Mary Brown chicken is always juicy even after left in the fridge for a day or two. We're obsessed with the spicy Mary Brown chicken and it's honestly the only chicken I want to eat if I eat out. Thank you for the wonderful customer service at this location! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è I will be coming back!!"
Mary Brown's Chicken (700 Strasburg Road),5,"I love Mary browns, they are bit on the pricey side of fast food, and the wait is a bit longer. But it's 100% worth it. The food is hot and great portion sizes"
Three Kretans Greek Restaurant,5,"Two friends took me to Three Kretans for my birthday dinner.  We all enjoyed our shared appetizers, main dishes, and deserts.  The Humus with Pita bread was a great choice for 3 people, as was the Saganaki OPA!  The Souvlaki dinners are served with a separate salad.  If they were both on one plate, you would get an even better sense of the sizable portion that it is.  Coffee and very high quality deserts rounded out a filling meal.  We took home a couple of containers of leftovers (including an extra order of desert).
Our server, Melanie, was very good in her role looking after us, and we enjoyed a few laughs together.
If you like a place where you're not crowded next to other diners, this is the place for you.  The tables are spread out over two levels, and it's all very comfortable.  For this visit (our first) we give Three Kretans a full 10 out of 10.
The photos, in order, are Humus, Saganaki, Cream of Broccoli, Greek Salad, Chicken Souvlaki, Moussaka, Tiramisu, and Bougatsa."
Three Kretans Greek Restaurant,5,"We ordered Three Kretans for takeaway lunch, and it was amazing!

I got the chicken souvlaki pita and greek salad, and the chicken was just melt in your mouth.

The ordering process was also so easy online, and the pick-up was great. It was still incredible after its trek from restaurant to work.

I honestly can't wait to have a full dine in experience sometime!"
Three Kretans Greek Restaurant,5,"Went with a large group and the service was very hospitable. Server was friendly. Even the chef came out to greet us. They care about personal touch.  I had the gyro dinner, it was very tasty. The baklava is unbelievable. I would eat here again."
Three Kretans Greek Restaurant,5,"Another favorite to add to my list. KW is definitely not disappointing. We have some great hidden GEMS here and NY taste buds are happy to find them. My experience at Three Kretans was great. The staff was friendly. I was greeted upon arrival with a warm welcome as she pointed out the lunch menu and recommended their top meals. The atmosphere itself was a whole vibe. Nicely decorated with great music made me feel like I was in Greece. Even though I've never been to Greece lol. The only negative was the washroom was out of service and parking sucks. However, no points lost because they did have someone in servicing the washroom and apologized for the inconvenience. And parking I got a ticket that allowed me to not get a real ticket for parking in a reserved lot. The waitress explained if you come over lunch parking lots 7-14 is theirs to use for free with no concerns for getting a ticket and if the lot is full, she'll give a little ticket to put in your dashboard to avoid getting a ticket. I got one of those as I parked in #33.

The food. Let's get to the real reason why we are here. Honey! The food was banging!!! Soooo good. Fresh, authentic Greek food. Great portions and cooked to perfection. My chicken soulaki cost me a little under $20 which is almost the same price of my McChicken meal. But sooo much healthier and delicious, you can't even compare the two.

I highly recommend you trying this place. You and your taste buds will not be disappointed. 5 stars all around!"
Three Kretans Greek Restaurant,3,"Great atmosphere, very cute set up. Food was ok, meat was a bit dry for both the gyro and chicken. Service was fast"
Gino's Pizza (Highland Rd & Lawrence Ave),3,"A box has never been more accurate. This pizza brings you back to pizza day in elementary school. Pepperoni is crisp and exactly the style we look for. Cheese had a nice funk to it.. maybe a parm blend? Sauce was adequate and crust was thick and normal. What brought this down 1 star was the service. Tried placing the order online and it said the store was temporarily close. Then called with mass confusion on their end. When we picked up, more confusion and poor attitude. Large pep after tax came to $11.30."
Gino's Pizza (Highland Rd & Lawrence Ave),5,Best pizza place in town. Top it up with their spice it up mix and pizzas are spicy and more flavourful love it. Quality is always best so far. Keep it up guys üëç
Gino's Pizza (Highland Rd & Lawrence Ave),5,This place has delicious pizza and for such a good price. Never had a disappointing pizza from there. Quick service and delicious food.
Gino's Pizza (Highland Rd & Lawrence Ave),5,I‚Äôm not a Gino‚Äôs pizza fan by any means but this location is different from the rest! The sauce has a delicious flavour. We love the thick crust option and it‚Äôs always hot and fresh tasting when I get it. Love this location. Awesome tasting pizza
Gino's Pizza (Highland Rd & Lawrence Ave),4,"The pizza was tasty but I thought the portion was less.

I did find the veggies undercooked but somehow I liked it as those were only veggies. If it would have been meat, it would have tasted yuck!

Whether or not I recommend this place? I, myself will try a couple of times and then I can answer this question.

I guess they don‚Äôt have proper oven as the pizza has been uncooked or undercooked is now a known issue."
Church's Texas Chicken (247 King Street North),5,"This place is one of the best to have fresh fried chickens. The chicken combos are affordable and filling and well-thought for people hanging out in groups.

Their jalape√±o bombers are the best in sides, french fries can be more crispy, and the biscuits are of mild sweetness and fluffy. Staffs are also kind and helpful. Will visit again when there is a craving for fried chickens."
Church's Texas Chicken (247 King Street North),1,After eating from this franchise down south US this barely edible tenders - TG for the sauces. 15 min wait and chicken pale. Hot tenders were ok but under fried. Two 3pcs and one 5 pc. this $30. Not again!
Church's Texas Chicken (247 King Street North),4,The nuggets were spicy but kind of bland. A bit unclean place but it‚Äôs a fast food joint.
Church's Texas Chicken (247 King Street North),5,"The in-store order and takeout process was smooth with friendly staff. Decent wait time for the size of order.

The fried chicken pieces were well portioned, very moist inside, and crispy on the outside, even after a 30 minute car ride, which was a pleasant surprise. It wasn‚Äôt too salty like other places and they weren‚Äôt greasy either.

Looking forward to going back again to reorder and try some of the other things on the menu!"
Church's Texas Chicken (247 King Street North),1,"The food was good, but the customer service was really bad. It was my first time visiting there, i was checking on the price with the indian girl who was standing there for billing. She was giving me a weird look as if like i am some kind of creep. And she was even hesitant to give us the cup for fountain drink. I don‚Äôt really understand why she treated me like that, but I noticed that she treated other customers in a good way with a smile. After I finished my food, there was not enough space to throw the waste because the garbage bin was full. Atleast clean the garbage regularly. Other than these, the food was really delicious. I am not going to visit this place again only because of poor customer service."
The Works Craft Burgers & Beers (589 Fairway Rd S.),4,"Good place and good food, however it is a bit slow so don‚Äôt go there if you‚Äôre in a rush.
Had the taste of heaven burger with onion rings and both were really good. The onion rings are amazing, really crispy and really delicious. Their milkshakes are served in a measuring cup which is really fun.

However, one of the major downsides is the tables are a bit sticky because the table varnish is coming off which can be a bit annoying. The place also seems understaffed since there was only was one server, but she was really amazing!"
The Works Craft Burgers & Beers (589 Fairway Rd S.),5,"We brought a large group here for a celebration. It was my first experience but others in our party were already fans and now I am too. Food was delicious and well presented. The measuring cup for glasses was fun and they had lots of good options for Gluten-Free, including french fries.

The service however was the stand out. It was fantastic! Knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. It really added to our day! Thank you."
The Works Craft Burgers & Beers (589 Fairway Rd S.),3,"Sadly gone downhill. Came for a family dinner. Asked for well done was still raw- even after sending it back it was pink in the centre. Our server/‚Äúfront end manager‚Äù was super nice and friendly but when he was busy random staff came and asked us the same questions over and over again (if we were done/wanted to pay/how). Sadly the communication skills were poor and we felt like it was some kind of candid camera show with how ridiculous it was. We won‚Äôt be eagerly returning despite loving the tower of rings, burgers, and broccoli (YES the broccoli is always amazing)."
The Works Craft Burgers & Beers (589 Fairway Rd S.),5,"Last year myself, my dad and my boyfriend attended this location and honestly had a really bad experience. I came on here and left a review explaining everything that had happened. Well fast forward to just a couple weeks ago, we decided to give The Works on Fairway Road another try. From the second we walked in we were greeted by a very nice gentleman server, who quickly got our drink order, our food order, and came to us multiple times to make sure that everything was all right and even offered refills on our drinks. Once we received the food, to say it was delicious would be an understatement. My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork poutine, and it was enough to feed three people! Every plate we had looked and tasted awesome. At the end of our meal when we asked for our bill, we were greeted by the lovely manager, Jamie! She was more than kind and asked us how our meal was, and explained how she was aware that we had a bad experience last time, and wanted to make it right. She gave us our whole bill at a discounted price to make up for the unfortunate visit we had last time. To say the least, we left The Works with full tummies and a smile on all of our faces. We will most definitely be returning. To the manager Jamie, Thank you for doing what you did and you have no idea how much we all appreciated you going the extra mile to make things right! The Works is very lucky to have you! 5 stars."
The Works Craft Burgers & Beers (589 Fairway Rd S.),2,"Came here with my family in on Monday evening to celebrate a birthday. It was a pretty disappointing experience. Our server was fantastic, and given that he was the only one working for the entire restaurant, I can‚Äôt complain about his service. He was as fast and as attentive as possible given the circumstances. The lack of staff is clearly an issue.
My food however was very disappointing. 6 degrees if Kevin Bacon burger with no bun and side of die cut chips was a huge let down. The lack of bacon hickory sticks was almost comical and the chips were as soggy and cold. Another burger at the table was just barely cooked.
When you‚Äôre out for dinner to celebrate a birthday, it should be an enjoyable experience‚Ä¶ that didn‚Äôt happen for our family."
Burger Stack,5,"WOW! This is an amazing little place. My son and I just stopped here, and we each had the double stack burger, and it was one of the best burgers I have had, and at just under $8, it's a pretty good deal. There are not many places left you can get one at that price. We also shared a family sized fry. The Fry's are delicious as well nice golden brown salted nicely. Just based on the fries, the poutine would be worth a try. I have seen many businesses in this space over the years. It's not the most noticeable space. So please give it a try, and if you love it, spread the words because I hope it stays."
Burger Stack,5,"Got a double smash burger and it was so amazing, friendly service, and the prices were reasonable (not cheap but certainly fair).
Not much dine in space as it is very small. We got lucky when we ordered that they were able to accommodate it quickly but I feel like the space isn‚Äôt equipped to handle as many big orders as it has. Regardless, a great burger!"
Burger Stack,3,"This was my first time trying this place, I was told to go for the Oreo Puffs but I grabbed a burger as well.

The burger was alright, I was not a fan of this stack sauce but otherwise it wasn't a bad burger. The flavour profile was as if Harvey's and DQ had a baby, the toppings and bun were probably the best parts, with a soft pillowy bun. This was my first smashburger and I could say I prefer regular burgers but it wasn't bad. I wanted to note it had a not great after-taste that was long lasting.

The Oreo puffs were rather good! I gotta say they are more fried than I normally like them and the cookie topping was stale but the puffs themselves made me happy inside, I'm a huge lover of deep fried Oreos.

Overall I don't know if I'd go again for a burger but if I'm craving the Oreos I'd wanna go again. I also would want to try out the poutine or fries, that I didn't try this time."
Burger Stack,5,"Stopped by here based on the reviews and it was worth the hype. Burger was fantastic, just what a smash burger should taste like.

Enjoyed the poutine as well. Would enjoy coming back again sometime"
Burger Stack,5,I have only good things to say about this place. A young family run business serving food that is priced below its actual value. Fried smashed burgers. Not from frozen patties. Worthwhile destination
McDonald's (Alpine St & Ottawa Rd),1,"Just did an order for a simple coffee, waited for minutes, yet got wrong coffee, everyone was watching each other, disappointed"
McDonald's (Alpine St & Ottawa Rd),5,Stopped by in the middle of a snow storm to warm up. Had apple pie. Really nice atmosphere. Amazing service. The people who work here are a joy.
McDonald's (Alpine St & Ottawa Rd),1,We have just ordered 2 egg mc mufin and 1 egg mc muffin with bacon strips and 2 hash browns the staff had just gave us the opposite of order with their own decision of adding a ham and forgot to add a hash browns. We are so irritated
McDonald's (Alpine St & Ottawa Rd),4,I spent 40.00 and when I got home the mcchicken sandwiches. X2.  We‚Äôre NOT ‚Ä¶..we has just the plain piece of chicken.    Come on why do we have to start checking our orders before we drive away.   This is a problem as the prices were different too
McDonald's (Alpine St & Ottawa Rd),3,"The have renovated this store ..seating is hard and uncontrollable..most tables needed cleaning..window sells had food on them and garbage, floor was the same way..
Lack of cleaning was my main issue other then my decaffeinated coffe was Luke warm , they replaced it with a fresh hot one with apologies."
Thyme Pizza N Rolls,3,Today I received an email from Thyme Pizza containing 50% discounts on Mondays. I ordered a Shawarma Pizza. This was the 4th time that we had ordered Shawarma Pizza. The quality had been decreased compared to my previous experience with the Thyme. This might be because of the 50% discount or more probably they have reduced the quality of their materials. The bread was somehow unbaked (like dough) similiar to frozen pizzas. Very tiny portion of chicken pieces were dropped on top of the pizza. I am so wondered how the quality can be dropped in such a fast rate. I had previously given Thyme 5 stars and now will rank them 0 to reflect how an action will receive the interaction.
Thyme Pizza N Rolls,5,I Wanted a quick lunch to go. I dropped into Thyme Pizza and Rolls. The place is very clean. The service was great and the food tastes fantastic. I Love the fresh made pizza crust and dough garlic strips. They have a great variety of foods and flavors. I can hardly wait for my next visit.
Thyme Pizza N Rolls,5,"I have been driving by this place for years and finally started ordering from them about a month and a half ago, boy have I wasted so much money on other pizza places.
Thyme is the best pizza I have ever had!!!
They offer individual sized pizzas and varieties to fit everyone in our family and even offer a build your own personal pizza.
The price is comparable to what we were charged for ordering two large three topping  pizzas at another establishment, only at Thyme we get five personalized pizzas that each of us enjoy.
They‚Äôve always had some sort of deal running every time we‚Äôve ordered which is a nice treat. Once they were giving away onion rings, now it‚Äôs a regular addition to our order because they‚Äôre the bomb as well!
They‚Äôre dog rolls, apple fritters and garlic bite things are so good also!!!!!! So much food yet there‚Äôs never any leftovers. We are yet to try their shawarma but that‚Äôs next!
Their customer service is awesome! I had to change my order once and they were so gracious about it. Also, their delivery is hot and always either on time or early!
If I could give them 100 stars I would."
Thyme Pizza N Rolls,2,"Ordered 6 pizzas, 5 were fine. Toppings were pretty scarce. The 6th pizza on the other hand looks like it was thrown around. Picture is how it showed up."
Thyme Pizza N Rolls,5,"First time here and asked for his Specialty- Shawarma Pizza. He didn‚Äôt offer any options, because there isn‚Äôt any and as it turned out, it‚Äôs perfect the way it comes.
The Sauce was put on right when we got there and when we got it home the impressive look and delicious taste was just right! The crust was almost like a crusty bread and my wife who does not always eat the crust, ate this one.
Will be back again."
Island Mix Restaurant & Lounge (Kitchener),5,"Been there twice and both times was really impressed with the presentation and quality taste of the food. We got the special chicken on rice and noodles - so delicious, especially with the hot sauce!!! Reminds me of Calypso Hut style food back in the GTA. Very happy to know I can get that sort of food locally. Have yet to go sample any actual curry or roti, but if they are consistent in delicious tasting food, I'm sure it will be amazing. The staff who served on both occasions were super friendly as well, and the place is nice and clean, great atmosphere with music and ""lounge"" type decor. Really would recommend and can't wait to go back! Xx"
Island Mix Restaurant & Lounge (Kitchener),5,"No complaints here, excellent food and friendly staff!

We ordered for our house party, the food was piping hot and delicious!

The chowmein was tasty and done right!
The veggies were not overcooked and had the right amount of crunch.
The chicken was really delicious as well!

Will be back to check out the music and lounge scene.

Thanks!"
Island Mix Restaurant & Lounge (Kitchener),5,"I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve lived so close to this restaurant and never visited it until this point.

They have big portions, everything tastes amazing. We ordered samosa (you get to pick 6 flavours), polourie (split pea in flour dough balls), chicken fried rice, goat curry with dhalpouri.

I tried polourie and dhalpouri for the first time."
Island Mix Restaurant & Lounge (Kitchener),5,"Shout out to Island Mix on King St W., Went for the first time today and it was delicious! I ordered the Jerk chicken with chicken fried rice, my brother ordered chicken fried rice & a double to try. In some places I find the fried rice is kind of dry, this wasn't the case here. The chicken was juicy & flavourful too. My brother said the doubles were great, they already had tamarind sour in it which we like (so if that's not your thing you should ask to exclude it). The hot sauce was good & flavourful, not very hot though. It was also a lot of food, one plate I found could be two meals. Service was prompt as well! Highly recommend."
Island Mix Restaurant & Lounge (Kitchener),5,"Island Mix is a great spot to get some delicious Caribbean food and enjoy a live DJ on the weekends. It can get a bit noisy especially on a Friday night but if you‚Äôre in a dancing mood you won‚Äôt mind at all. Plus, if you have a large enough party (8+) you can always reserve the private area at the back. Give them a visit."
Renegade Chicken (15A - 2960 Kingsway Drive),4,"Probably would have given this review 3 stars if it wasn‚Äôt for how GOOD the chicken was. Fries were cold when we got them. Chicken was luke-warm. Pickle chips included only like 3 pickles, with one being super small I wouldn‚Äôt even count it. With that being said, the chicken was so good and the dipping sauces were amazing (highly recommend the ranch). Buttered Buffalo sauce and Nashville hot sauce were both delicious! Would order again."
Renegade Chicken (15A - 2960 Kingsway Drive),1,"Absolutely pathetic.

I rarely write Google reviews anymore, so when I say that this was ""a complete and severely disappointing experience."" What I'm saying is that there's no recovery.

I ordered a tender combo at the ""Nashville 911"" spice level and honestly even trying to pass off what I received as ""Nashville 411"" would still be such a complete and utter insult to true Nashville hot chicken that I don't even want to suggest that as an alternate name.

I've had some of the spiciest hot chicken available in Nashville. It was so spicy it made me blush, sweat, cry, and get a runny nose while I ate it, even my stomach could tell how hot it was.

Whatever pathetic chicken I was sold here could have been outdone with nothing more than freshly cracked black pepper.

This chicken was so lame I wish I had ordered KFC because if I had at least I would only have myself to blame for how pathetic the food I paid for was.

The only reason I'm okay with having to leave 1 star is because the mac n cheese wasn't completely appalling. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't good, I just can't definitively say it wasn't the most pathetic excuse for mac n cheese I've ever had. The chicken though was BY FAR the most pathetic excuse for hot chicken I've ever had."
Renegade Chicken (15A - 2960 Kingsway Drive),5,"The best chicken fingers in the region, the best chicken sandwiches, great French fries ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve ordered many times and NEVER been disappointed!  Excellent, reliable and inexpensive food!  Just order ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll love it!!"
Renegade Chicken (15A - 2960 Kingsway Drive),1,Everything tasted good but chicken was quite raw. Got food poisoning.
Renegade Chicken (15A - 2960 Kingsway Drive),3,"Ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich and sauced chicken fingers. The Buffalo chicken sandwich was really good, the chicken fingers were okay. Biggest flaw was the fries were cold which seems to be a common comment. Would order just the sandwich  next time"
La Cucina Pizzeria (Kitchener),5,"We loved the place. Location is good n happening. The food is awesome, and we ordered vegetarian pizzas, Ravioli, along with some drinks. Got the complementary strawberry üçì cake on top of it. It's a kids friendly place. You need to book the table before going. It's in the middle of Downtown kitchener, and there is 2 hr street parking available around the area, but you have to find the parking by roaming around."
La Cucina Pizzeria (Kitchener),4,"I visited this place alone. Ordered some pasta, drink and a dessert. Overall it was a great experience. Would like to give it one more try with my friend."
La Cucina Pizzeria (Kitchener),5,"Convenient location, with a beautiful patio and plenty of seating. They have many options to choose from (including vegetarian), with good sized portions. The quality of food was great, staff were very friendly and attentive, and service was very quick. Highly recommend trying it out!"
La Cucina Pizzeria (Kitchener),5,We have been here a couple of times now for dinner and haven't been disappointed. The pizza is awesome. Homemade pasta is perfectly cooked. Desserts and appetizers also don't disappoint. Everything tastes fresh and authentic.
La Cucina Pizzeria (Kitchener),4,"Their pizza is very good. It has the just right amount of crust and crisp to it. And the toppings and the sauce is delicious.
Their pasta, however, was a bit underwhelming. Compare to their pizza, the pasta didn't have enough flavour.
The service was great.
I'd come back for the pizza but wouldn't order their pasta again.
Their tiramisu was pretty good as well!"
Boston Pizza (Bingemans),2,"If you like undercooked, cold, doughy pizza this boston pizza is the location to go.

First youll be greeted oh wait correction NOT be greeted,  but a not so nice hostess who will seat you to your table.

This is the second time i ate here due to the convenience of the arcade attached for the kids & bowling alley love that!

‚Ä¶..but unfortunately this restaurant is not it the food is awful! This is the second time something was wrong with food temperatures & cook. Like its pizza?

The stars would be for the server/waitress was kind and very lovley.

Hopefully, this restaurant can step up cause being in a place with entertainment for kids + adults & having your restaurant attached is prime

‚Ä¶..but this boston pizza just Flops! Improvement is definitely needed."
Boston Pizza (Bingemans),1,Got our drinks pretty quickly but waited an hour for our order to be taken and then another hour for the food to come out. They brought out the adult meals first and the children‚Äôs meals out 10 minutes later. So we all had to wait. The waitress was really sweet but everything else was very annoying and very unprofessional. Also I hope the very young boy behind the bar has a SmartServe because he didn‚Äôt even look old enough to work legally in Canada
Boston Pizza (Bingemans),2,My husband ordered steak dinner. It was ridiculously over salted. I got the salmon bowl it was meh. I would consider going elsewhere after spending the day at big splash if you‚Äôre looking for a convenient location. The food is underwhelming. This is the second time we have been disappointed. Server Dani was great though.
Boston Pizza (Bingemans),1,"This place is always confusing and time-consuming to get approached by the employees at the hostess stand. There‚Äôs always people cutting the line saying that they have reservations for the bowling alley while we are waiting in line to get a table for two people. There should be a designated host stand just for the restaurant. We waited 10 minutes just to get a table.

It was a Friday night and so service was busy which is understandable however the food is overly greasy, over priced and to be honest I can make food at home much better. The only reason why we went out for dinner was because we received a gift card from the holidays. I know for a fact that the majority of the food comes in frozen boxes or bags which then are simply reheated either using a microwave or quickly reheat it in a frying pan. Absolutely nothing at this restaurant is fresh except for a salad and vegetables.

After receiving the food I politely asked the server for chilli flakes and you can see in the pictures how I received it covered in someone else‚Äôs disgusting greasy fingerprints and this is exactly showing the start. This restaurant is in disrepair and needs a fresh coat of paint, steamed carpets and overall decor needs to be cleaned and dusted.

Within the bathroom one of the stalls toilet paper dispenser was broken and the one thing I don‚Äôt want to do is to touch a roll of single ply very thin toilet paper that previous occupants have touched with their bacteria covered hands. In addition in the washroom two out of the four sinks were not working as you can see the state of the disrepair of the bathroom. The counters, floors, mirrors were covered in water primarily because both paper towel dispensers for empty. Within my hour and a half, I visited the washroom twice which no staff members came by to refill the paper towel dispenser or took time to clean. Would you can especially see in the last photo of the handle of the door of the washroom. It is covered with greasy fingerprints, liquid dripping down the door and an array of weird brown colours splattered all over the tiled wall.

My closing thoughts are that the owner and management do not care. Boston Pizza has no passion in the food that they make it is not fresh and is reheated microwaved food. You all need to step up and do better.

Don‚Äôt waste your money here, go somewhere nice, like a family run business. Anywhere else but here would have more passion then with this location is doing."
Boston Pizza (Bingemans),5,"Highly recommended taking some time to stop by for some bowling and drinks with your friends or family. The manager was on top of everything and makes the best drinks. Always a great experience.
Thanks scott!"
Popular Pizza (Waterloo),5,"I recently visited the Popular pizza store in Waterloo area, and I must say that it exceeded my expectations! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a smile and friendly customer service. The staff was welcoming and went out of their way to make sure I was happy and had everything I needed.

The pizza options are really impressive, with a variety of Indian styles, toppings, and side snacks like panzeroti, chicken wings and french fries. I was particularly impressed with the selection of vegetarian options, which is something that is hard to find in a pizza store. The pizza tasted fresh and delicious, and I could tell that they used high-quality ingredients.

The atmosphere of the store was great and inviting, and I could tell that the staff genuinely cared about providing a great customer experience. I was honestly surprised at how well the store was run and the level of customer service that was provided.

I would highly recommend this pizza store to anyone looking for a delicious and top-notch pizza experience. Their quality and service are second to none, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed!"
Popular Pizza (Waterloo),4,"During one of our leisurely strolls, we stumbled upon a charming eatery called Popular Pizza in Waterloo. This pizza parlor is conveniently located across the street and boasts a simple yet enticing menu. While exploring the establishment, we noticed an ice cream counter, although it appeared to be unattended at the time. We decided to try their cheese breadsticks, only to discover that they were pre-packaged, which was a bit unexpected as we were hoping for freshly made garlic bread. Although we haven't had the chance to sample their pizzas yet, we've heard rave reviews about their deliciousness and look forward to trying them during our next visit. Situated in a vibrant area with numerous dining options, this pizza parlor is definitely in a prime location. The entire street is adorned with various eateries, creating a lively atmosphere where you can savor delectable cuisine at any time."
Popular Pizza (Waterloo),1,"There was a time this Pizza place was my go-to spot but unfortunately, it's now become one of the places that I'd wish to give negative stars! We ordered Butter Chicken Pizza & Cheese Sticks recently and the experience was awful!

The Cheese sticks were cold and tasteless. The Pizza was cold too but the worse part was the bland tastless Chicken. There was basically no salt I think. The Chicken also seemed smelly and stale.

The quality has gone down so bad at this place. The flavors are no longer the same either. Not sure what has changed but I am definitely not going back here again!"
Popular Pizza (Waterloo),1,"ATTENTION EVERYONE
Don‚Äôt order from here, i ordered a butter chicken pizza, the chicken is raw on pizza when i called to complain about it, they said its not raw this is how the make it. 0 customer service they didn‚Äôt even bother to say you can bring it back we can check. The lady over the phone saying she is from head office was extremely rude and told, do whatever you want this is what it is.
Wish i could have gave a zero star and definitely i am gonna complaint to city.

*please teach your staff whoever takes call how to treat the customer and what the customer service is*
They don‚Äôt even bother to listen the customer."
Popular Pizza (Waterloo),1,"I got ice cream, the price was 6$ and it was a very small scoop that the taste was same big ice cream in walmart that you can buy just 5$ for 4 Litres. It was awful,  and it's not fare to sell same things. Please don't go there at all."
Cheesecake & Desserts (Waterloo),3,"The desserts are fine, they are good, I would rate 4 stars, but I am giving 3 stars just for the price aspect. I just got one cupcake and one cookie, and it was like $9 with taxes. And for that reason, I probably wouldn't go back unless there are other things as reasonable prices"
Cheesecake & Desserts (Waterloo),5,Me and my company loved the taste and the appearance of the cake! Very delicious and perfect design! ü•∞  I also loved the quotes  attached to it. Perfect for birthday gifts ! Kudos!
Cheesecake & Desserts (Waterloo),1,"Ordered cheesecake from uber eats, it was repulsive. Definitely not fresh and smelled and tasted like cardboard."
Cheesecake & Desserts (Waterloo),5,"I have ordered food from Dessert Shack twice and they have never let me down!! Both times we have ordered through Uber Eats after midnight and it was a great late night snack. The first time we ordered the 4 Slice Cheesecake Combo, a strawberry shake and 2 Cookie Dough Ben and Jerry's ice cream and a candle. We only ordered the candle to get our order over $50 to get $20 off our purchase. Sadly, they forgot to give us our candle! But it didn't ruin the night. The cheesecake was amazing and my friends told me the strawberry shake was soooo good.

Last night we ordered another cookie dough ben and jerry's ice cream, 2 chocolate shakes and we even got 2 free slices of cheesecake for ordering over $12 on UberEats! We were able to pick from 2 slices of cheesecake, 2 cupcakes, ben and jerry's or 2 different types of merch socks for Dessert Shack.

We got a great amount of dessert for the amount of money that we paid. On top of that, they gave us a very cute note on our food bag thanking us for ordering from them and hoping I am staying safe and having a great night.

Pros:
- great dessert
- kind employees
- go above and beyond for their customers
- great availability/hours

Ways to improve
- make sure to give the full order
- wait time is sometimes longer than wanted"
Cheesecake & Desserts (Waterloo),5,I got two cupcakes and they were amazing . Along with a very inspiring quote that happened to come at the right time for me .
Campus Pizza,4,"Great pizza, especially if you have just been demolished by a systems modelling midterm. The people here are great, they gave us a free upsize from medium to large. Also they have a deal going on right now for $10 for a large pepperoni pizza, get two of those and share with 3 other brothers for max value"
Campus Pizza,5,"Smashing! Worth the money. Their per slice pizza is one of the best crusts I have had. Spicy meat lovers, vegetarian, and Hawaiian are the three I have tried and fervently recommend.

This is the first time I am giving two five star reviews so close to each other.

PS: They are the only place that have blue bins for recycling to use for customers"
Campus Pizza,4,"I recently visited Campus Pizza in Waterloo, situated in the heart of the market. While the pizza tasted great, I found the menu presentation in the shop to be confusing. It would be helpful if the menu clearly displayed the available options and pizza varieties to avoid any confusion. I would advise other customers to have a clear idea of what they want before approaching the counter, as the staff can be pushy in trying to take your order quickly. They have outdoor seating available where you can enjoy your pizza, and it's worth mentioning that it is primarily a take-away shop. Personally, I particularly enjoyed the garlic bread that I ordered alongside the pizza."
Campus Pizza,3,"We got Campus Pizza on a weekend afternoon delivered to us. We paid by Watcard and all we had to do was give them the student number.

The phone operator was a man with an accent, and he was very rude when taking our order. We understand that it was loud inside and it was probably super busy, but he kept telling us to hurry up. They also couldn‚Äôt hear us, so we had to repeat ourselves a few times which is fine, but just their attitude made the ordering experience negative. On the other hand, the driver was super kind when they dropped off the order, so that really saved our experience with the staff here.

We got three large pizzas ($40.15). The delivery deal is 2 large three toping pizzas for $25.99 and 1 large three toping pizza for $14.16. The pizzas were overall well portioned and very affordable. The taste was okay, the crust was hard after awhile so you definitely need to put it in the oven or microwave to reheat it. You get what you pay for, most of the time we get it as a late night snack since they‚Äôre open until 5am."
Campus Pizza,1,"Follow the instructions.
I was told that this was a good deal but I was disappointed.
PHOTOS ATTACHED FOR PROOF

Okay so this is my first order. I ordered for pepperoni with 4 extra toppings but got 2 toppings. There was no Pepperoni, No Sausage. Why?
I ordered for pepperoni, then chicken, beef and sausage.

This is so Sad. Was disappointed upon getting home and I drove from a distance.

You need to follow the orders and toppings accurately.

Aside the mix up it tasted good"
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (Ottawa St),4,"Fast and freindly service.  Food came out quick, well prepared.  The seating area is in need of updating. One bathroom was out of order at the time.
Update: Bathroom definitely needs work. Cleanliness of seating area needs focus."
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (Ottawa St),1,"We have been regularly ordering from this store for years.. I have noticed inconsistencies which started recently from old meat to this! Ordered regular fries and sandwich.. Fries are hardly 1/3 of the portion and the sandwich looks like someone put a nugget in it and that too torn up!
I have had this order before and this is not it!
I wish they would be consistent with what they produce.."
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (Ottawa St),5,"We ordered via the App however when we got to the location, their system had not received the order. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and ensured that our order was ready for us within a reasonable time period. I've been to this location many times for family orders but by far, this was the best experience we have had with the staff. They are to be commended for getting things done right despite being extremely busy in the store with walk-in orders and online orders. The place is also extremely clean and well maintained. A pleasure to deal with them."
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (Ottawa St),1,"Tried the chicken sandwich. Just bad! No real flavour other than grease, texture was odd. Best thing was the bun. It's no Big Mary."
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (Ottawa St),1,Hello guys I want to let you know this place is waste of time I order nine-piece Chicken Thursday deal two fries they said 15 minutes waiting time and they took more than 1 hour and they promised me to give two extra chicken piece and large fries but they didn't give me one piece extra chicken and the large fries they just give me the order what I ordered so really bad experience and I don't like the service they giving us just count the chickens and look at the fries do it look like large box of fries what they offer me no that's totally cheat and lie I ordered two fries they said because of you wait for so long they're going to give me two extra piece a large fries which is they didn't give it to me that's why I post the picture to to let you guys know the cheat they doing it with their customer
Harvey's (Westmount Rd W),5,"I attended this location with a friend tonight, and we both ordered an ""Original Burger with Cheese"" combo.  The smell of the char-broiled beef was mouth-watering, and the fries were nice and hot.  Staff were very pleasant to talk with, and the restaurant was clean overall.  The burger you see in my photos is complete with the toppings of my choice, so yours may look entirely different.  We were quite pleased with the value for money we received."
Harvey's (Westmount Rd W),5,"This is one of the best Harvey's I've ever visited in Canada. The burgers are always fresh and juicy. Moreover, the pleasant behaviour from the staff always make this a special place to dine in."
Harvey's (Westmount Rd W),5,"I love the unique taste of a Harvey‚Äôs hamburger compared with other fast food hamburgers. But now, more than ever, Harvey‚Äôs has something for everyone! From poutine to chicken burgers, I have never had bad meal here. This location was very clean and the staff was pleasant. At Harvey‚Äôs you can choose exactly which topping you want so at Harvey‚Äôs, every burger‚Äôs special! Today we tried their strawberry cream pies (they were a hit!) but my husband LOVES their milkshakes! What is your favorite Harvey‚Äôs treat?"
Harvey's (Westmount Rd W),3,"The one thing I like about Harveys is that they let you add all available toppings & sauces for no charge. I personally love my burger a bit saucy so I get them to add lots of different sauces and they have some really good tasting sauces. The Original beef patty was very thin and the Grilled Chicken breast was very dry so the overall taste was very average. Their fries & onion rings are alright. I did like their chicken nuggets although they are very tiny. The small donuts are really soft and probably the best part of the entire meal.

Overall, the place has decent/regular tasting burgers that are budget-friendly. Only thing that stands out is the customization that is available with sauces & toppings."
Harvey's (Westmount Rd W),3,"I was actually impressed by the original Harvey burger (first time) fries were fine.
Service slow, even though there were very few customers at dine-in. They weren't. Exactly unfriendly, but not exactly friendly either. A smile does wonders, just my recommendation!
The dinning room seemed like it had not been updated since the 60ties. It is huge, I'll give them that, and I was half of the people who dined in. But it seemed worn and dirty and generally very unappealing. I know burger chains dinning rooms are not exactly cosy places that makes you want to linger but this is possible the worst I have tried.. I may do drive through again, but not sure I would like to dine-in again."
Foodie Fruitie,5,"Good Korean fried chicken mount not your traditional style.  Unagi dish had very little unagi, but my ramen was very filling. Not your traditional ramen though. The skewers didn‚Äôt seem grilled. I would come back."
Foodie Fruitie,5,"My absolute favorite comfort food place for Asian cuisine! I absolutely love their sushi combo as you get so much food for such a great deal. I also love their fried rice and their curry chicken!

It can get very very busy as it's usually visited by a lot of uni students so be mindful when coming during the busy hours as it can take a while to get your food.

The atmosphere is very nice and I highly recommend people to eat here if on a budget and are looking for some great comfort food!"
Foodie Fruitie,5,"I love this place! The portions are big, it's cheap, and close to campus.
I really like their sushi rolls (especially the Las Vegas roll and any of the Dragon rolls), they are very filling and tasty. I would also recommend the curry chicken or donburi."
Foodie Fruitie,5,"I recently dined in here and had a great experience. My friends and I, very much enjoy the food from this place. Great place to dine in, respectful staff and good crowd. Food is well worth the price which isn‚Äôt very high either."
Foodie Fruitie,5,I LOVE coming to this place when I am in town! Super cheap prices and good food. The wait staff is really nice and the menu has a lot of items to choose from. I've come here +10 times and always enjoy the cheese wontons and the sushi combo! Highly highly recommend. The food comes out pretty fast too!
South St. Burger (Ottawa & Fischer-Hallman),5,"I recently had an exceptional experience at South Street Burger, where I enjoyed incredible food, delightful drinks, and outstanding customer service. The menu offered a wide array of mouthwatering options, including juicy burgers and delectable sides, all made with high-quality ingredients. The staff was attentive, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction. The drink selection was impressive, with refreshing options that perfectly complemented the flavors of the meal. South Street Burger truly exceeded my expectations in terms of both cuisine and customer service."

South St. Burger (Ottawa & Fischer-Hallman),5,"Amazing experience here today.
Tali (?) was amazing.
Celiac disease/gluten allergy and they were able to accommodate beautifully!
Gluten free dedicated fryer for fries
Individually packaged gluten free buns
Separate gluten free toaster for buns
Changed gloves
Used parchment paper while preparing
Used separate ingredient bins & utensils
Absolutely amazing & delicious!
Thank you for providing a safe place for people with celiac disease / gluten allergy to eat!!"
South St. Burger (Ottawa & Fischer-Hallman),5,"Felt so bad I came 10 minutes before they closed and they We‚Äôre all but smiles and willing To do my full order! Quick and efficiently Too, thanks again!"
South St. Burger (Ottawa & Fischer-Hallman),1,"I spotted this place in the Sunrise Centre today and decided to pick up burgers, fries and onion rings like I did many times in the past when there was another restaurant of this chain on Fairway Road years ago.
The food was not good at all today.
Burgers used to be delicious but very disappointing and tasteless.
Fries which are fresh cut were obviously sitting around for way too long. The onion rings had sat in the warming tray so long they were stuck together and greasy.
To spend $60.00 for two double burgers large fries and onion rings was a bad experience.
Save your money as the regular burger chains have better quality control and at a much lower cost."
Pizza Roma +,5,"Grabbed a couple panzerottis one early evening this week.  First time here,  and it definitely won't be the last.   Sauce,  dough and other ingredients are great quality.   Prices are very reasonable for this quality also.   Owner is friendly and pleasant to deal with.  Since it was the last order,  he even delivered it himself.
Definitely give it a try!"
Pizza Roma +,5,This pizza place offers big slices with a generous amount of toppings. The fridge is plenty cold with a good selection of drinks. Highly recommend.
Pizza Roma +,5,"A little too far from my place to get the food delivered. However, the pizzas are great! I have to drive there for 15 minutes to pickup the food, but it's worth it."
Pizza Roma +,5,"One of my friend suggested me for this pizza last week an it was so yummy,  my kids love it.
Definitely we repeat again. One of the best pizza in kitchener waterloo."
Pizza Roma +,5,"Best pizza and best service ever.
You will get your pizza on time everytime. Fast service as well."
KFC (1020 Ottawa Street North),1,You can't tell how stale this bun is by the photo I paid almost 15 dollars for a combo. the fountain pop was piss warm and there ice machine wasn't working I upsized my drink to a large. After tasting it I asked for the bottle which was also warm. The chicken leg I got I don't think I'd feed that to someone's dog tbh. üòï  why has prices went up for everything but quality is atrocious. Everything left in these photos is what I didn't eat. So basically paid KFC 15$ to sit at there table üôÑü§î
KFC (1020 Ottawa Street North),5,I love that they have KFC and Taco Bell combined so you can get a little of both. A KFC Tuesday special with fry supreme instead of boring fries ü§§. I'll be very dissapointed if they close up this last combo store in my area. I used to go to the one on Homer Watson boulevard but they changed it to KFC only. Unfortunately I'll never be back to that location and I feel many others followed suit.
KFC (1020 Ottawa Street North),1,"Kids are too busy talking to each other on the head set about graphics cards to finish an order. Messed up the sandwich, served pop with no syrup and forgot the side dips, the only thing right were the fries.

The rude old human refused to apologize, then proceeds to ask for the half eaten wrong burger back (with a creepy smirk on their face) before they would give us the correct food that we paid for. Super uncomfortable experience."
KFC (1020 Ottawa Street North),1,"Terrible Service, ordered ahead so we wouldn't have to wait on a Sunday afternoon. When we arrived the person at the counter said the order wasn't ready "" Oh, I didn't think you were actually coming"". I was quite annoyed and obviously showed it because my 8 pieces of chicken consisted of 7 backs and a leg after waiting for nearly 20 min. Wouldn't advise this location."
KFC (1020 Ottawa Street North),4,I love the Veggie Sandwich at this KFC just add jalape√±o peppers and onion if you want it extra spicy.
Swiss Chalet (Victoria & Frederick),5,"Comfort food at its finest! Super cozy place, type of place to sit down and have some carbs :)
I had the chicken sandwich and it was moist, juicy, and crispy! Super delish!
Fish and chips were crisp and fresh, and quarter chicken dinner can‚Äôt go wrong with ever.
Our server was amazing. She made sure we had a good experience.
Atmosphere was nice, not to loud or awkward silence.
Overall would go back again!"
Swiss Chalet (Victoria & Frederick),2,"Came here for Father's day dinner . Was excited about getting the chicken and ribs combo that is being advertised.  But in return got dried out ribs and small pigeon like chicken serving.

Service was great but meal was awful. Didn't even finish meal because  tasted awful.

Please see attached picture.

Very disappointing for a father's day dinner.

Chq number 260

Sat down at 513pm today."
Swiss Chalet (Victoria & Frederick),5,"Cheryl was extraordinary. She made you feel like you had come home to Mom's house. Management believes that everything is a chance to get better and every day they get better and better. Fries were hot, chicken were large crispy and juicy. This is now my go to Swiss Chalet location. Highly recommend. If you're lucky to get Cheryl you will know how lucky you are"
Swiss Chalet (Victoria & Frederick),1,Ordered a chalet sandwich and a vegetarian stir fry for my friend and I to eat.  Showed up when order was ready at 9:04 restaurant was closed had to use drivethru to pickup order.  The vegetarian stir fry had chicken in it and we were not given cutlery or extra sauce which were both asked for on the order.  Had to run next door to Harvey‚Äôs and ask for cutlery in order to eat our food.
Swiss Chalet (Victoria & Frederick),1,"Swiss chalet is a family favourite in our home we eat here about once a week and this location specifically has gone to absolute trash, the quality has decreased and the employees and service I have literally no words for even the management. The worst part is I have spoke to the owner and he was very kind sincerely apologized for the behaviour and told us we should go to his other location which shouldn‚Äôt be the answer as there‚Äôs no reason for staff or managers to treat paying customers this way. They have made it so we don‚Äôt feel comfortable dining in so we bring home which is never as good, but the quality of food they send home was disgusting today the fries were not cooked and they were soggy I live 2 minutes from the store so it‚Äôs not from the drive and when I brought our meals back they only wanted to replace the fries I had to fight with her to get the meals replaced WHICH I drove back to the restaurant untouched and we wanted our meal to be fresh not cold chicken with fresh fries. We are just to our wits end. When I am paying for food I will absolutely speak up when paying for food that is inedible and I do not expect the staff to give attitude and be rude for asking for what we paid for. This was most definitely the end of the line for this restaurant"
FLAME HOUSE GRILL & BAR,5,"We have been their regular customer for last one year since we moved to kitchener. They provide excellent customer service. Good ambience for dine in and their food is consistently tasty ( also the reason for late review ,  i‚Äôm so excited for the food that i forget to take pictures for the review) .We have tried other restaurants in the area as well but flame house has provided consistent good experience with no complaints at all.Highly recommend this place. Doesn‚Äôt matter what you order( hakka, curries, appetizers) everything is full of flavours and taste."
FLAME HOUSE GRILL & BAR,4,We were there on a busy day so it took a bit of time to get the table and waited a while to order the food. Surprisingly the food arrived much sooner then the expected. We have tried tandoori momos and Chinese cuisine. Definitely recommend the momos but Chinese foods are decent in taste. Portion size of the dishes are generous.
FLAME HOUSE GRILL & BAR,5,"FLAME HOUSE GRILL & BAR; A must visit place for the Fine Indian & Hakka cuisine. Me & family love to visit their Kitchener location while we visit around there. Few dishes to mention here; Mo:Mo varieties, salt & pepper prawn, Butter Chicken, Lamb Vindaloo, Veg Manchurian & chilli chicken dry, don‚Äôt forget their Goat Briyani-naan too.
You will be surprised to taste each items made with extra care by years of experienced chefs. Smiley customer service & beautiful ambiance are other not to be missed things.
Cheers"
FLAME HOUSE GRILL & BAR,5,"I really loved food here. Noodles, soup, Manchurian were all great. Although, we arrived late, they still accepted our order, but they insisted we pay while we were eating which was a little weird, but I guess that was okay. Overall, had I arrived to the restaurant earlier, our experience would have been enhanced."
FLAME HOUSE GRILL & BAR,5,Wow this place is amazing!!! I ordered the Sweet Corn Broccoli Soup & Methi Lamb. The veggies were fresh and the lamb melted in my mouth! Lots of vegetarian options if your not feeling like meat too. Highly recommend and will definitely be back!!
AD Double Deal Pizza Wings,5,"I've been a regular customer of Double Deal Pizza and Wings for months now and I've never been disappointed! The pizza is fantastic - always fresh and delicious, with a great variety of toppings. The wings are also amazing - so flavorful and cooked to perfection. The staff is always friendly and accommodating, and the prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend giving Double Deal Pizza and Wings a try!"
AD Double Deal Pizza Wings,5,"Double Deal Pizza and Wings is simply amazing!  The quality of their food is unbeatable, and their take-out service is fantastic. The staff is friendly, professional, and efficient, and the food is always ready on time.

Their pizza is top-notch, with a delicious crust that's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The toppings are always fresh and perfectly cooked, and the cheese is melted to perfection. And their wings are simply divine! They're juicy, flavorful, and would suit anyone's taste.

What's more, the prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you get. Whether you're ordering for yourself or for a group, Double Deal Pizza and Wings is an excellent choice for take-out. You won't be disappointed!"
AD Double Deal Pizza Wings,4,"I've only ever ordered delivery, but it is always on time and the pizza has always been fresh as if it just got out of the oven. For the best deals for your buck, this is the go-to pizza restaurant! For the double deal 2 Large Pizza's, Wings, garlic bread and drinks, you cannot get the same deal elsewhere for the price. The pizza taste is amazing and never had any issues ordering from them. We have been ordering g here for 10+ years without any concerns or complaints."
AD Double Deal Pizza Wings,5,"I recently tried Double Deal Pizza and Wings for the first time and I was blown away by the quality of their food and the level of service I received. The pizza was delicious, with a crispy crust and fresh toppings, and the wings were perfectly cooked and seasoned.

What impressed me most about Double Deal Pizza and Wings was the value for money. Not only were the portions generous, but the prices were very reasonable compared to other pizza places I've tried in the past. I appreciate that they offer great deals and specials too, which makes it an even better value for my money.

I highly recommend Double Deal Pizza and Wings to anyone who loves delicious, affordable pizza and wings. I'll definitely be a regular customer from now on!"
AD Double Deal Pizza Wings,5,Best pizza in the neighbourhood. Got pizza and wings thru skip once and was hooked. The wings and pizza are great. Probably my favourite wings around now. Went today for some slices and it‚Äôs some of the best pepperoni pizza I‚Äôve had in a long time‚Ä¶ and such a good deal! $3.99 for two huge slices and a pop. Amazing. Found our new pizza place!  Will for sure be back to place phone orders and pickup orders. Don‚Äôt need skip the dishes when it‚Äôs this close to home.
Wendy's (350 Westmount Road West),1,"Evening/night staff is extremely slow and rude. only one car ahead of me in the drive thru, dine in was closed so no one to serve in the restaurant, took me 15 mins just to tell them my order than another 10 mins for them to get it made, there were 3 workers and not at all a big line to get through. Food quality does not nearly compare to other locations. said twice for extra ketchup and the older bald gentleman gave me attitude about asking and apparently 2 packs of ketchup is extra, and the burger tasted like it came straight out of the freezer. do not waste your time or money"
Wendy's (350 Westmount Road West),4,Very clean and inviting area. Food was hot and fresh the only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because the chili was a bit too watery but other than that it was all great. My son loved the nuggets and even asked for more. My family will be coming back again!!
Wendy's (350 Westmount Road West),1,"If your debit/credit isn't working, the wise thing to do would be to post a sign informing people at the entrance of the drive through so they don't end up getting trapped in the drive-through; especially if the service staff is slow as molasses and casually chatting with customers. It's odd that nobody in management thought to do this: it should be fairly obvious. Do better."
Wendy's (350 Westmount Road West),1,"They were only serving the drive through and wouldn't help people in line. The older gentleman ahead of us waited over 15 minutes at the counter, ignored, and was struggling to stand and started shaking. The frostys were on sale for 99¬¢ and when we ordered them we were charged normal price so when we pointed out the gigantic posters everywhere saying the price they said ""oh, you want it for that price?"" Why is that a question? You should automatically change the sale price and people shouldn't have to ask for it.
Worst service ever at a Wendy's."
Wendy's (350 Westmount Road West),1,"This location should be renamed. I suggest Vendys or Wendis, because its similarity to Wendys ends at the food. I eat Wendys multiple times a week at the waterloo locations, have for over two decades, so I know what to expect. Here however the burger bun was stone cold, the patty was cold, and the cheese was (therefore) unmelted. If you told me this burger was made two hours ago I would 100% believe it. The fries were cold and tasted like they were salted twice to the point of bitterness. And the fountain drink dispenser was so uncleaned/clogged that instead of pouring smoothly the drink would shoot out of it like a cannon, splashing all over your hand, and the supposed Coca Cola tasted like brown water. Whether its lack of training or poor management, this location is absolute trash and I wouldnt recommend it for prison food."
China Taste,5,"Handmade Crab meat cheese wonton are amazing, will definitely try them AGAIN! other dishes are also superb. Good food at terrific prices. The owner is always friendly. I used to call them to place order, now they have their own website offering pickup and delivery which is fantastic. Highly recommend!"
China Taste,4,"Very good. Someone had mentioned that you shouldn't get the cheese wontons - well they are really good! But yes, they don't have much cheese in them. If they put a bit more filling in, they would be perfect. The veg egg noodles and mushroom rice - good. General tso tofu - AWESOME. The tofu is crisp, small cubes, and very flavourful. Unfortunately we DID NOT like the egg rolls at all. We would definitely try more things on the menu another time."
China Taste,1,"Terrible!  Singapore noodles had NO curry on them. They were white!  4 little shrimp in the $13.35 order.  When I called them they said that that's how they make them and basically if I didn't like it,  too bad...have a nice weekend.  So rude!
Initially they were going to replace my order, them changed their mind.  I have been ordering from them for years.  This is the 1st major negative encounter.  They were not interested in retaining me as a customer.   There are other places in the area for me to take my business."
China Taste,5,"We recently moved to Breslau and have been trying different Chinese food restaurants, by far China Taste is the best! You must try their homemade crab wontons, OMG are they ever delicious!!! Their chicken balls are actually homemade as well and very tasty, normally I don‚Äôt love chicken balls! Overall, the food is extremely full of flavour!! The restaurant is incredibly clean, and the staff extremely nice!! I think we‚Äôve definitely found our go to spot!!! If you try it, it will be yours too!!!"
China Taste,4,"Ordered a la carte vs family dinner and really enjoyed the meal, costs a bit more but you get better flavours.  The Chinese Vegetable dish was too spicy for a few family members, but I enjoyed the heat. The ""new"" menu items seem to be fusion inspired, similar to Hakka Hut in Cambridge.  Our first date was at a Chinese Food restaurant, 28 years ago, so that insired this anniversary meal."
Fat Bastard Burrito (Kitchener),5,This was the best burrito place I ever go. The food was fresh and delicious. The staff was friendly. please add sauce into your food if you want to improve your taste buds.
Fat Bastard Burrito (Kitchener),5,Craving for a Mexican food! This is the perfect place for you then... #burritos #fries #chips #salsa
Fat Bastard Burrito (Kitchener),3,"I've been here a few times and the food tastes good, but there are a lot of other issues. This location really skimps out on portion sizes compared to others in the same restaurant chain. This one is conveniently located in downtown kitchener but I recommend going to the one in Waterloo instead for larger portions and better customer service. Another minor thing that probably bothers me more than others is that their take out containers for naked burrito bowls are made of paper, and they put the bean paste on THE BOTTOM which makes the takeout container soggy. Like who thinks that's a good idea?"
Fat Bastard Burrito (Kitchener),2,"Ordered two Burritos around 6pm and definitely noticed they are not what they used to be. Ordered one chicken and husband got the barbacoa both had a very sour taste, very salty and the chicken burrito specifically left a very weird taste in my mouth. It was so salty that I had to remove the chicken from the Burrito and rewrap it with just the veggies and beans in it..it's so sad that this place has gone down hill in quality because their Burritos were always so good."
Fat Bastard Burrito (Kitchener),1,"Very very disappointed
Uber pick up order Date 25 april
Ordered 2 big veggie burrittos
And gave tip with good intention
But in the end i realised i ordered from wrong place
Better you knew what i asked and what you gave.
Its not a mistake , its a intention to save a food cost.
Uber is covering your bogo offer cost
And it was just veggie not like other meat burrittos.
Worst burritto (It was a hot sauce with Rice Wrap)
Owner should knw how ur team people are working
You can check the cameras if i am lying.
I will only suggest dont do to this with any our indian people or local customers.
Treat your customer better
please."
Indo Hakka Corner,4,"Hakka restaurant that is worth a try.

This was our first time and dine-in dinner. The overall rating would be 4 as we liked their food and it was good but it was not great.

We tried Hakka cuisines -
Tandoori Momo's - 4/5
Veg Manchow soup - 4.5/5
Hakka Noodles - 4/5
Veg Manchurian - 4/5

The food was served in time. We didn't have to wait for long. The lady serving us was amazing, great service.

We have had better Tandoori Momo's around tri-city area.

As this restaurant is located in a plaza, there are ample parking spots. However, not able to locate handicapped accessible parking closer to the restaurant.

The prices were not really high and we would recommend their meal options for 1 or 2 or more ppl. That is more value for money.

They have 2 washrooms and both were very clean. One of the washroom is handicapped accessible.

They have lots of space for dine-in. We really liked their ambiance, it gives very cozy vibes coz of the lighting.

All in all, it's definitely worth trying once."
Indo Hakka Corner,3,"We went to this place for dinner on a Friday night. The servers were friendly.
The food portions are fairly decent. The prices aren't too much either.
The Amritsari fish Tikka was fresh and delicious.
The Chinese dishes were tweaked taking I to account Individual spice levels.
All in all a ""value -for- money"" meal."
Indo Hakka Corner,5,"We tried this place called Indo Hakka Corner in Kitchener. Indo Hakka Corner provides a combination of Indo Chinese and mughlai cuisine. Mughlai cuisine is type of cuisine that came about as a result of the Mughal rule in India from 1426 to 1857. During that time in India's history, the food was rich and cooked with aromatic spices, nuts, and dried fruits.

The food was delicious and amazing. We had a chance to try Vegetables Pakora, Chili Chicken Dumplings, Chili Garlic Prawn, Chicken and Shrimp Chow Mien, and Alo Pratha. Omg, their food was delicious. Some of the food has to be eaten while it's hot otherwise it won't taste as good."
Indo Hakka Corner,4,"The food here is good but I find their hot and sour soup to be very salty. We also asked them to make the food mild but it was spicy enough that our noses were watery. Lots of options on the menu, maybe too many because it seems neverending lol but overall a good Hakka joint"
Indo Hakka Corner,5,"I recently visited Indo Hakka Corner restaurant and was extremely impressed by their outstanding service. The staff were friendly, attentive and went above and beyond to ensure my dining experience was exceptional.

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted warmly and shown to my table promptly. The server was knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent recommendations. The food came out in a timely manner and was delicious, with generous portion sizes.

What impressed me the most was the attention to detail the staff provided.The server checked on me frequently to ensure I had everything I needed.

Overall, I highly recommend Indo Hakka Corner for their excellent service, delicious food, and pleasant dining environment. I will definitely be returning to try more of their dishes."
KW Grabb-a-Pizza,5,"Perfect pizza for those looking for Indian taste, they make spicy and delicious base with chilli, Ginger and coriander. I ordered Indian style base with 3 toppings and it was awesome. Price is so reasonable for such a delicious pizza. Additionally, free dipping sauce of your choice. Definitely recommend this place if you are foodie and pizza lover. Staff is quite appreciative and pizza ready on time."
KW Grabb-a-Pizza,4,I‚Äôm not a big pizza fan fun this place changed my mind. The pizza is remarkably good. They have great offers and combos and the service is great. I wouldn‚Äôt consider it as a dine-in though.
KW Grabb-a-Pizza,5,So I let my kids review this one and they were happy with the pizza here today they said it may even be our new spot.... flavor was good and the pizza was quickly made give it a shot ....better than Mario's that was here before this....we will try the Indian style next...and give an update
KW Grabb-a-Pizza,5,"This is one of the best pizza places I have seen in a while. They made sure my order was correct before cutting the pizza for pick up to ensure it was lightly toasted and lightly sauced enough  for my parents likes, labeled everything clearly for pick up and their customer service has been exceptional every time we have order. They have even brought out pizza outside in the pouring rain to the car window while waiting to pick up! Absolutely amazing service!!"
KW Grabb-a-Pizza,4,"Everyone knows the rules, one bite only. No flop, nice cheese spread, but sauce was ordinary. Overall, it's a decent pizza for Monday night football. 7.1/10."
Twice the Deal Pizza (8 Bloomingdale Rd N),1,"Ordered a large Hawaiian pizza, and it was made and delivered quickly! However, the dough is almost entirely raw. Out of fear of getting sick I had to cook it in the oven to help cook it through better. Very disappointed."
Twice the Deal Pizza (8 Bloomingdale Rd N),5,"Best pizza in town, I like the crunchiness of the dough and the generosity with toppings. They have best Chocolate Chip Cookies as well."
Twice the Deal Pizza (8 Bloomingdale Rd N),3,"Lol asked for well done pepperoni slice, the guy left it in the oven a bit too long while he was talking with his coworker. It became extra extra well done with a touch of burnt.

But oh well, cheap quick convenient pizza slices never hurt!"
Twice the Deal Pizza (8 Bloomingdale Rd N),1,Absolutely careless. I was eating in my car and their delivery guy was care less and swung his door into my car and scratched my paint. His excuse was i didn‚Äôt have enough room with the bag. He had tons of room he also had no cars beside him on the other side. Absolutely terrible very lazy
Twice the Deal Pizza (8 Bloomingdale Rd N),1,"I ordered 2 cheese pizza $11.99 each total it was $28.25 and Should be $27.09 i Ask why
If you don't Wanted just leave it. very poor customer service"
Double Double Pizza & Chicken (347 Erb St),5,"Absolutely stellar inexpensive local pizza place. We love walking down and ordering a pizza then cruising over to the corner store for 10-15 while they make the pizza. Great establishment, lovely service, would recommend"
Double Double Pizza & Chicken (347 Erb St),4,Pizza was great for $8 single topping large pizza. We had chicken popcorn as well. Although they were not crispy but they are best enjoyed with some dips. I found the service to be a little slow even though it wasn't rushy. But I would definitely would want to go again.
Double Double Pizza & Chicken (347 Erb St),5,"The quality of the pizza was very good, and the staff was very polite and quick to serve. Their walk in pizzas are value for money for sure. Definitely recommend if you are looking for some affordable options to dine in."
Double Double Pizza & Chicken (347 Erb St),1,This place used to be my favourite pizza but has gone completely downhill! The last three times we've ordered have been horrendous and uneatable. We reached out to the restaurant to rectify this and they sent me another terrible pizza that was ice cold almost three hours after our original order. We live close and used to be regulars but will have to find a new pizza place going forward
Double Double Pizza & Chicken (347 Erb St),2,"I bought classic deals 2 I believe.

50$ for some very dry wings. we waited 20 mins so we were expecting hot freshly made food.
The food is okay but are all lukewarm and not looking to fresh:("
Fresh Burrito (170 University Ave W),4,"I ordered and I got myself a chicken quesadilla. I loaded mine up with: chicken, cheese, tomatoes, cilantro, corn, green peppers and a burrito sauce. This quesadilla doesn't look like much but it was delicious! I found they skimped on the chicken and veggies but it was so tasty. I think it could've been toasted longer but otherwise good! The burrito sauce was medium spice and delicious! I would absolutely go again to get another quesadilla and try out their other menu items."
Fresh Burrito (170 University Ave W),1,"I completely understand mistakes happen, but if you accidentally burn a burrito, tell me and we'll work something out. Don't just give it to me burnt."
Fresh Burrito (170 University Ave W),1,"Not worth, total waste of money. The choices you out on all toppings and service is rude. I ordered a burrito bowl and it was Complete joke.
Update: I ate it in like two seconds and I'm still hungry. Complete RIP

If anyone wants to eat real Fresh burrito please visit the stores in Brampton or Mississauga.
I would never recommend this particular place to anyone as it is waste of money as well as time.
The staff over there is very rude. Tbh"
Fresh Burrito (170 University Ave W),5,I ordered a regular chicken burrito bowl and it was amazing. The ingredients were fresh and the chicken was juicy and perfectly seasoned. The service was pretty quick too. This is now my go to spot to eat in the UWP plaza.
Fresh Burrito (170 University Ave W),5,Really solid burritos. The steak and shrimp I got was cooked fresh on the spot. Their chicken is also not dry at all
Crystal Palace,4,Delicious place for some comfort Asian food! I got the combo 12 and it was super filling for a good price! The atmosphere is nice and the staff are very friendly! Great place to eat with family and friends as they have family meals too!
Crystal Palace,4,"I recently visited Crystal Palace Restaurant with a friend to try their Chinese cuisine. As an Indian, I was a bit apprehensive about the taste, but to my surprise, the food was delicious. We ordered egg rolls and vegetable rolls, but were a bit embarrassed as we were not expecting only one portion size. Nevertheless, the taste was amazing, and we enjoyed the food thoroughly.

The ambience of the restaurant is really nice, and it is a great place to have a relaxing conversation. The noise level was just perfect, not too loud, which helped us to enjoy our meal in a calm and composed atmosphere. We noticed a lot of orders coming in through Uber and DoorDash, which is a testament to the quality of the food and popularity of the restaurant.

The restaurant is located in the heart of the town, making it easily accessible. The prices are reasonable, and you can also enjoy a beer while you dine. Overall, if you want to enjoy authentic Chinese cuisine, I would definitely recommend visiting Crystal Palace Restaurant."
Crystal Palace,4,"I have to admit after living in KW for decades I'd never gone here and I'm glad we did. The food was good, service was great and quick and prices good too. It is mostly Canadian-Chinese and they did have some Dim Sum too ( real Chinese food). We'll be going back. Has what I like, good food, good service so good value."
Crystal Palace,5,"Our group of five had dinner on a recent Sunday night. The service was prompt and courteous. Our food selections were hot and flavourful. Some dishes were willingly modified to suit our vegan tastes. Based on our experience, we would recommend this restaurant."
Crystal Palace,5,"Food is so fresh and tasty. Just the perfect Chinese food place. Won Ton soup satisfying, chicken Chop Suey and chicken balls with sauce spot on. Food is very fresh. Love it.
My go to for sure..."
Kam Yin Chinese Restaurant ÈáëÁáïÂ≠ê,4,"Sesame chicken was good and would probably be even better when it hasn't been in a takeout container for the drive home. Other dishes were well prepared. The ""Beef with Ginger"" dish is not the same as ""Ginger Beef"" you might get at other restaurants, so dont order it expecting it to be breaded. The fried rice tasted more burnt than I would like. Food was ready quickly and seems fresh."
Kam Yin Chinese Restaurant ÈáëÁáïÂ≠ê,1,We got dilivery that was good but the food was not ot had no flavor i would have done better buying a jar of sause and cooking my self will not re order what a waste of money
Kam Yin Chinese Restaurant ÈáëÁáïÂ≠ê,2,"I normally LOVE this restaurant! But today was a sad day. I always get the black pepper steak. Look at this photo... Absolutely no sauce... The sauce makes this dish, normally there is enough sauce to add your rice to. Today, no sauce, steak is dry because there is no sauce. And a restaurant that I normally love and order from a few times a week. Let me down...

Come on guys. You're better than this."
Kam Yin Chinese Restaurant ÈáëÁáïÂ≠ê,5,"I come here 3 times a week for their lunch special. They always have delicious food, great service, and a lovely atmosphere! My favorite Chinese place in town."
Kam Yin Chinese Restaurant ÈáëÁáïÂ≠ê,1,"If I could give zero stars, I most definitely would!  The Chow Mein was tasteless and the stir fry vegetables were scarce... on the endangered vegetables list?  The Sweet & Sour Shrimp was nothing short of pathetic, almost no taste to it.  And finally, the Honey Garlic Ribs were barely sweet, no signs of garlic and like all fast food, looked nothing like the picture.  With so many other choices in Waterloo, we will not be ordering from Kam Yin EVER AGAIN!"
Kim‚Äôs Kitchen,5,"I had the pleasure of dining at this fantastic chicken joint, and I simply couldn't wait to leave a 5-star review! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with friendly smiles and a warm, inviting atmosphere.

The menu was diverse and offered a variety of chicken dishes that catered to all tastes. I opted for the green onion chicken, and it was undoubtedly some of the best I've ever had. The chicken was cooked to perfection - juicy on the inside, and crispy on the outside. The seasoning was just right, striking a perfect balance between flavorful and not too overpowering.

The side dishes were equally delightful, with the pickled radishes adding a fresh, tangy kick to the meal. The staff was attentive and ensured that my dining experience was nothing short of exceptional.

Not only was the food delicious, but the portion sizes were generous as well. I left feeling satisfied and eager to return for more. This is the kind of restaurant that makes you want to come back time and time again. It's the perfect spot for a casual meal with friends or a special occasion with loved ones.

I highly recommend this chicken spot to anyone looking for a mouthwatering and memorable dining experience. Don't hesitate to give it a try - you won't be disappointed!"
Kim‚Äôs Kitchen,5,Very good seasoned and soy chicken. The green onion was good too but if I came back I would get the seasoned chicken and soy. The chicken was juicy and fresh for most of the pieces. Daikon radishes were refreshing. Service was prompt and very polite. I came back for takeout pickup via Fantuan and the food was ready before the estimated time so when I got home the chicken was a bit less crispy. I should have of gotten there earlier.
Kim‚Äôs Kitchen,4,"Chicken is delicious & comes with pickled radish. Fried rice cake was a bit too sweet for me, I probably won‚Äôt get that again. Service was nice, the person at the cashier was very polite & friendly. :)"
Kim‚Äôs Kitchen,5,"Some of the best chicken i've ever had. Serving size was plentiful and the cheese corn was also fantastic. Got our food really fast and the waiter was really nice. Pretty much no complaints at all, highly recommend!"
Kim‚Äôs Kitchen,2,"We ordered half and half platter. One was fried yogurt chicken and some other type of chicken. Honestly I totally totally don‚Äôt like it.
It might be good for your taste buds, but not mine.
the beef dumpling were okay."
Little Caesars (210 Lorraine Avenue),1,Still waiting to hear back from Little Caesars.  Went last weekend.  Found black plastic pieces embedded on the bottom of the crazy bread.  Didn't finish the bread or pizzas after that.  Little caesars do not seem concerned enough to get back to me.
Little Caesars (210 Lorraine Avenue),1,"Worst experience I had with Little Caesars. Ordered pizza online,  was given a time the pizza would have been ready and it wasn't. Bought the stuffed crust pizza that in the past was awesome but tonight, when a piece was picked up, the whole top slid off leaving just a wet soggy crust."
Little Caesars (210 Lorraine Avenue),5,"I never understood what it fully meant to be alive... Before this pizza I just lived . The 3 meat GOAT of all pizzas was unreal. At first glance it was just beautiful, like any other meat lovers dream.... Until everything changed. I got slapped in the face with pure flavour the minute I took the first bite. By the end of my last slice, I didn't feel normal. Before I could even lick my lips I found myself floating off the ground. I couldn't believe my eyes as the pages of my life flashed before my eyes, the final chapter of life has begun... I ....AM ...HIM."
Little Caesars (210 Lorraine Avenue),5,"This evening i had the pleasure of enjoying the tastiest pretzel crust pizza, the crust was dripping with butter and granular salt, the combination danced upon my tongue doing a playful tango. I experienced pure euphoria as my tastebuds were baptized in butter....the flavor transcended me to a whole new level of being....i have died and went to heaven......also my heart feels funny...."
Little Caesars (210 Lorraine Avenue),1,"We love little ceasars, but wasn't impressed with today's service. They forgot to put the cheese puffs in the oven. We waited an extra 30mins for the cheese puffs. The large pizza wasn't hot anymore. There was also pineapple on the pizza and we didn't order any pineapple. I am allergic to pineapple. Staff standing around talking a lot."
Burger Factory (550 Hespeler Rd),4,We tried The Machine burger on Friday which was their daily suggestion and on $4 off. So do check out the options. We also tried The Crispy Chicken burger along with Golden Cut Fries and Ginger Ale. Overall the food is good and for us the best part was that it was Hand Slaughtered Halal. All their options are Halal. I would recommend it to folks looking for Halal option in Cambridge. The footfall was decent and the store is clean and conveniently located on Hespeler Road opposite Burger King. They also have funnel ice creams and steak/chicken subs but we did not try that option.
Burger Factory (550 Hespeler Rd),5,"We've gone to Burger Factory several times and have always enjoyed their burgers! They  are always fresh and great topping selection! Here are a few pictures from our last visit when we were invited to try some of their burgers! The larger of the two burgers was the Juicy Lucy on Fire (with added bacon, onion rings, and an egg). The second burger was an original on a gluten-free bun (also dairy-free) with an added egg and grilled onions. Delicious!"
Burger Factory (550 Hespeler Rd),5,Burger was expensive but worth it. Enjoyed the freshly grilled chicken burger.Fries are good and overall atmosphere was good.
Burger Factory (550 Hespeler Rd),4,"I love that all burgers are made fresh, and I don't have to ask for the fresh petty. Onion rings were so good, but it was little oily. I have tried jucy lucy and Nashville crispy chicken. Chicken sandwich was so good."
Burger Factory (550 Hespeler Rd),4,"Overall I'd say this burger joint is better than *most* fast food joints that serve burgers, but it's not the best there is. I'd still put for example five guys a step above this. Overall the burger was good, I think cooking it over charcoal would give it that extra punch. The milkshake was also good, albeit small for the size it's served in. So cost ratio makes it over priced for what it is. And the poutine I would not order again, there was something off putting about it, and I'd hazard a guess it's because of cheap quality gravy used."
iShawarma,4,"I eat a lot of shawarma and the chicken shawarma offered here is certainly in my top 3 for the region. Their sauce is unique and very nice. The consistency regarding how meat you get could use improvement. I also wish it was standard to get a full piece of bread when you order the full sized platter - heartbreaking to pay all that, see your fresh homemade bread get chopped in half, and see the other half of your bread go back in the storage box. Pictured here is the junior platter with their spicy house made sauces. Very good value compared to other shawarma places. Check them out for sure."
iShawarma,2,"Used to love this place, lately it's been getting greasier, smaller portions and more and more clueless staff. Got it today, was told they were out of hummus so settled for a junior chicken platter. Oily and greasy, and the chicken it solid and dry af. When they do have hummus they barely cover the bottom of the container and refuse to add more. Not sure what happened but I'll heading to better places.  Hope the owner sees this and brings it back."
iShawarma,1,"This place is so nasty I have no idea how they are still in business. They literally have me food poisoning
I ordered a gyro and the meat was obviously sitting out for a long time it got steamed and mushy not crisp like it should be. I should've known with how greasy the floors were. They have not cleaned the bathroom in days, in addition they stored equipment in the bathroom. Should be shut down."
iShawarma,5,I have had Shawarma Poutine before. But this one... This one is simply better. Its above the rest. You have to try it to believe it. First I just loved the Shawarma Poutine. Now. I specifically love iShawarma's poutine.
iShawarma,5,Good big and tasty wrap shawarma there!
Ye's Sushi,5,"Great AYCE sushi place. Very extensive selection of sushi and other items to choose from, and they were all excellent. The service was adequate and never delayed. Especially considering the slightly cheaper-than-usual price, this is one of the best AYCE sushi restaurants in the area."
Ye's Sushi,1,"I was expecting a japanese restaurant and I was disappointed. There is no sashimi and very few options of japanese food. The tempura was very greasy and the flour was common flour, not the specific one dor tempura. once we reqlize that japanese food was not their strongest cuisine, we tried other dishes: the mongoliam beef is very good, and the tay rices are ok too. . The dessert is all you can eat too and the fried pudding is very good . The lower part is the service. first of all they let us make an order and realized that the meni was woth wrong info, se we had to redo the order. The server are very impolite and they put the food in the table throwing each dish, and are incapable to give any  information. they also dont look any happy to be there . It was very uncomfortable. Over all, I beleieve thera are best options  with much better food and servide . It costs 27 dolar per person without taxes - very expensive for the experience. I don‚Äôt recomend."
Ye's Sushi,5,"We took the kids here for their first time trying non-grocery-store sushi, and everyone loved it! Lots of delicious food for decent prices - we were all stuffed and took leftovers home (we ordered a la carte). Staff was a little impersonal but nothing rude or inattentive, just not overly friendly. Atmosphere is nothing to stand out but still very nice."
Ye's Sushi,1,"Was there for dinner with a friend.  When you walked in the place had an off smell and was not the cleanest place, they sat us at a dirty table with the last guest garbage on the seat.  The server was short and did not smile.  The food was ok I have had better sushi.  The charges we received for a total of 24rolls a rye and ginger and a beer was almost $100.  They charged us all you can eat which we did not want, 5 bucks for a rye and 4 bucks for a pop and 6 bucks for a bottle of beer.  Being ripped off would not have been so bad if the rest of the place was acceptable.  I would find another place to go.  I'll never go back!! not worth the money."
Ye's Sushi,1,"I love sushi. I try to go to many places. I avoided this place for a few years due to my last experience but had an hour to waste before picking up a family member in the vicinity and was hungry. This was the last time I will go to this place.

About 10 years ago it was good. Even 6-7 years ago it was good and my wife and I would go there with friends. It was not my favourite but it was good.

The last two times I have been to this place the soy sauce was incredibly salty (appears that I am not the first reviewer to mention this). I have never experienced soy sauce this salty in my life. Today I tried to ask if they had a low sodium option but the first person walked away from me while I was asking. It was a, ""Do you have any other soy-- OK, you're walking away from me."" The second person was quite helpful and told me there was a no sodium option. He brought it over. It tasted like bad wine or beer that has been in a can for a few years. Not something you want to dip your sushi into.

I love octopus but there was no octopus on the lunch menu.

The spicy sushi was quite boring and not spicy at all. I do not like the places that put tempura in it but this one was mostly rice and one small piece of salmon wrapped in a piece of seaweed that was too large for what it contained.

At the end, I could not finish the sushi I was given due to taste rather than being full. It was the worst food experience I have had at a restaurant in years.

As for atmosphere, maybe it was a slow day, but in the past we would be sat throughout the restaurant. When I came today around 2 PM, all customers were sequestered to the left side (when you walk in) of the restaurant. Makes sense to have things easier for servers. But it really stuck with me that there were not even enough people to fill the rest.

168 Sushi in Waterloo is a much better option for AYCE. They even have an outdoor patio. But I would rather buy a sushi tray from Zehrs or Wal Mart than go back to this place."
Lazeez Shawarma (370 Highland Rd W),5,"To end a not soo great day, with the tastiest comfort food, is the best way to go. We love the quantity, quanlity and all the flavors of this place. Chicken on rocks our favorite, and poutine is amazing as well, definitely worth it."
Lazeez Shawarma (370 Highland Rd W),5,"First time visit here. Welcoming staff , patiently took the order. Thank you Mohammad and hummaid for your generous service. I loved the chicken platter with garden salad. Chili fries üçü were delicious . Good seating arrangement, washrooms were also cleaned ."
Lazeez Shawarma (370 Highland Rd W),2,"I went to order a regular platter, but they gave me a large platter, and they gave salad without me wanting it, literally 37 dollars for all that, what a rip-off when you want just a regular and thats it. The sauce they put on the shawarma isn't like the other places, it is too sweet and nasty to eat, i couldn't finish more than 1/8 of it."
Lazeez Shawarma (370 Highland Rd W),2,"Not what it used to be!
Half n half is just full of rice with tiniest amount of fries, in both boxed we ordered.
Their spicy sauce is not the same. None of it is the same."
Lazeez Shawarma (370 Highland Rd W),5,"I went in yesterday and got the combo for 4
And I can honestly say best bang for your buck shawarma I've had in a long time!! it's very good quality food and it's a very good price
If you haven't been here try it I would say it rates in the top 10 in the Waterloo region and thats saying a lot cuz I go to 1 place new almost every week. There's only one negative that I could see and it pains me to say that they're hummus isn't that good but I could live with that they're hot sauce is awesome the toppings were awesome and the shawarma was very flavorful I say if you haven't tried it try it today...."
Burger King (1950 Third Avenue South),5,Had a great experience here. The dining area is really nice and the service was really fast and the food was all fresh and delicious. Jalape√±o bites and poutine were both fresh and delicious
Burger King (1950 Third Avenue South),3,"Went through the drive through.  The lady was very pleasant.  I ordered a medium Coke Zero, no ice. The receipt shows I paid the $0.80.  I however got a small drink.  I am finding more often that attention to detail is getting worse."
Burger King (1950 Third Avenue South),1,Would give a zero if possible. Ordered two Mushroom Swiss Whopper. See photo what we were served. Absolutely the worst fast food ever. BK corporate where are you ??? $20 worth of pure cold garbage.
Burger King (1950 Third Avenue South),1,Cold onion rings. Ask for extra salt got nothing. Order took 15mins and kitchen staff are nasty. Splashing dirty water on a fryers while fryers beside are on and serving  to public..
Burger King (1950 Third Avenue South),1,"Food again was less than acceptable.  All items were cold when delivered by SKIP. Spending $25 and getting $5.90 credit is a ridiculous slap in the face. The mozzarella sticks were very overdone, chicken fries overcooked as well. Order time was 1:00 p.m. very clearly I was sent the lunch crowd leftovers.  I was going to do the online survey,  but the first piece of information was missing, that was necessary to proceed. I called the location to get the store info, and nobody answered....went to voicemail and mailbox was full, call was disconnected. How convenient,  when a customer wants to complete the survey!! Hiding behind SKIP is your way of providing poor food quality is THE WORST BUSINESS PRACTICE EVER!!! I want ALL MY MONEY BACK FOR THIS DISGUSTING DISPLAY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.....I'LL GO TO THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN HERE AS THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU TOOK MY MONEY AND SENT ME GARBAGE..."
Rivaaz Indian Pizza & Cuisine,5,"I moved to Calgary and come back to Lethbridge every chance I have just to come eat at rivaaz, they have the best better chicken I have ever tasted. Everyone must try this restaurant! The butter chicken poutine is a must try from the secret menu it‚Äôs delicious!"
Rivaaz Indian Pizza & Cuisine,5,"Food is really good. If you going for dining, it might take sometime as it seems they don‚Äôt have lots of staff. Flavor was really good."
Rivaaz Indian Pizza & Cuisine,5,Such a delicious lunch! Samosa's were on point! The curries were delicious!! The naan bread was devoured right away too. Thanks for a great lunch!
Rivaaz Indian Pizza & Cuisine,1,"Ordered a create your own pizza with butter chicken and a Rivaaz grill. Ordered off Uber.
The pizza tasted exactly like a 711 cheese pizza, the butter chicken had no flavour. Or at least I couldn't taste it over the stale crust flavour. Waste of the $2.75 extra I paid for the chicken.
Everything in the grill was burnt except the rice and fish.
Spent $41 and barely ate anything.
Super disappointed as the reviews seemed good and the food in the pictures looked amazing"
Rivaaz Indian Pizza & Cuisine,5,"I hope this place stays in Lethbridge forever. Seriously, look at that pizza! (First time trying the butter chicken pizza today and both I and husband loved it).
It's great value for the food as well.

The Bengan bhartha is great also. (Vegetarian) The chicken Biryani is the best I've had. (I'd list more of what I've tried but I've loved everything so far...)

So far I've only had take out since I usually like to just sit at home and be cozy to eat.

Anyway. I'm happy I decided to try this place a few months ago when I realized there was an Indian restaurant there."
Pizza King and Donair,4,"I had Pizza King for the first time tonight and it was outstandingly delicious! These guys are on point with pizza pie perfection using fresh and original ingredients and very reasonable pricing. As a former chef of 14 years I can honestly say it‚Äôs some of the best ‚Äúmom and pop‚Äùtakeout pizza I‚Äôve ever had! Well done.üôèüòã ..and I was happy to see it was made by members of our Sikh community, they are known to be extraordinarily kind and benevolent  people who spread love, peace and apparently deliciousness everywhere they end up. Who knew!? Lol
Waheguru ji gentlemen , thank you! üôè"
Pizza King and Donair,4,Pretty good donairs. Although I did ask for no tomatoes and they put tomatoes on but hey that's okay.  I got here I'm frying up the meats in the back so you know they just didn't throw it in the microwave or something.  I got mine to go it's pretty simplistic atmosphere to sit in there but it's more of a takeout place anyways so that's fine not looking for the Taj Mahal or anyting here just decent quality food everything was clean the people were friendly and I'll definitely be going back
Pizza King and Donair,5,We just ordered from here and the food and service was top notch. I think we found a new favorite pizza place. Thank you
Pizza King and Donair,5,100% best pizza place in Lethbridge. The Cheeseburger Pizza is a must try. Shawarma and Donairs are good too. I like the donair sauce here more compared to Pizza73. Order it through their website as it is cheaper than skip.
Pizza King and Donair,4,The pizza is pretty good. Kinda similar to CPU if you have ever had it. Really big slices which is awesome. It is in a bit of a weird location but if you can look past that then you won't be disappointed
Red Swan Pizza (Lethbridge),5,"The pizza is awesome! They dont go cheap on toppings, the flavours are amazing, already craving more. Will 100% eat here again."
Red Swan Pizza (Lethbridge),5,Good pizza! Good price! Update: was here for a pick up order. The place had other ppl waiting for orders. All walking out with 2-5 pizza all of different sizes. One with 5 large pizzas. If that doesn't tell you how in demand this place is. I'm not sure what will. Possibly one of the best pizza places in town!
Red Swan Pizza (Lethbridge),5,Very good pizza. You can tell that this place actually takes time in preparing the pizza. Not cheap on toppings. Fair price and very pleasant staff.
Red Swan Pizza (Lethbridge),5,A very good pizza experience with red swan. I'm totally flattered by the quality of the pizza and their customer service.  I have tried honey garlic chicken pizza and yet another delicious experience!! Must try! üëçüëç
Red Swan Pizza (Lethbridge),5,"Easy to order, good price and amazing pizza!! Plus the delivery was efficient and an very nice delivery guy üòä"
Pizza 73 (417 - 21A St N),4,"4.5 star rating I prefer this one over the south side one, really kind Costomer service he just forgot to give me my hot sauce and I paid for it that‚Äôs fine tho my fiancee went up and got it and he gave it too us and apologized. But 4.5 stars :)"
Pizza 73 (417 - 21A St N),1,"Absolutely worst service I‚Äôve ever had. Gave the driver one direction, do not knock. He sat there ringing my door bell."
Pizza 73 (417 - 21A St N),5,"Best place to get pizza in town, nice staff and customer service as well. Food quality is top class. The guy name ‚ÄúRJ‚Äù is superb in making pizza. Everytime he makes it, it‚Äôs delicious. Really appreciate your work ‚ÄúRJ‚Äù‚Ä¶."
Pizza 73 (417 - 21A St N),5,"Pizza was so good , was according to our demand without any contamination  ."
Pizza 73 (417 - 21A St N),1,I love this place even food is good but the guy with nose ring  is confused i think he doesn't understand English everytime i go he doesn't understand
Birdy Famous Fried Chicken Waffles & More (Mayor Magrath Dr. S),5,"I ordered the chicken and waffle! The chicken had the perfect crunch, seasoning, juiciness without too overpowering. Combined with the crisp and chewiness of the waffle with maple syrup, it‚Äôs a playful rhythm in your mouth.

I had the chance to take to the owner and all ingredients are sourced locally and prepared as you order.

This is definitely a place to visit whenever in Lethbridge! My only regret is I didnt order the 4pc one!"
Birdy Famous Fried Chicken Waffles & More (Mayor Magrath Dr. S),5,"What a find! This place should be the definition of a 'hole in the wall' restaurant. I do inspection work which takes me all over the province. I was needing some lunch before heading out of town. Managed to catch the sign for Birdys and thought to give it a try. The chicken was tender and 'oh so flavourful '. The coating had a solid crunch to it as well. Surprisingly, the combination of the syrup and Sriracha mayo added a whole lot of depth to each bite.
Next time I'm in Lethbridge ill be trying something else off the menu."
Birdy Famous Fried Chicken Waffles & More (Mayor Magrath Dr. S),5,"I am traveling on my motorcycle from SK to BC. Got to hotel after long day of travel and absolutely starving.  Google had too many options so I looked outside and lo and behold  across the street is a fried chicken place,  sounds good I thought.. I couldn't have made a better choice, well worth the wait for freshly made, locally sourced fried chicken. Had a great chat with the owner? While I waited.  I swear this is the best fried chicken I have ever had, and with hand cut locally sourced fries... OMG, made my day!"
Birdy Famous Fried Chicken Waffles & More (Mayor Magrath Dr. S),5,"Hard to get fried chicken in southern Alberta that isn't an American run chain, pumping out mass produced garbage. The food here is honest to goodness top dollar, I'd recommend the sandwich menu, but every other thing I've tried has been a home run too. Give yourself some spare time to get your food, since it's made to order. Cheers."
Birdy Famous Fried Chicken Waffles & More (Mayor Magrath Dr. S),5,This food is fantastic and this place needs more attention. Real breaded chicken and real waffles. It's so tasty and if you ask they even give you a quick education on how to enjoy the sauces they give you.
Papa John's Pizza (Lethbridge),1,"Bit disappointed tonight, was on the phone for 15 minutes and explained my order as clear as day. Showed up and they were still missing a papida‚Ä¶ Not even a apology or anything. Someone needs to answer the phone who can understand very clear instructions. Definitely  will not be returning to this location.  Have my food was cold by the time I got home. I also asked for 8 garlic parm wings and 8 bbq wings and I got all BBQ. What a joke"
Papa John's Pizza (Lethbridge),2,I got the breadsticks. They were swimming in oil and butter. Yes little excess oil is normal but having 8 table spoons flowing to the side is not . I hope I can add pictures here...
Papa John's Pizza (Lethbridge),5,"I tried almost all of their products and I really enjoy their service, In take out and delivery"
Papa John's Pizza (Lethbridge),5,Great tasting pizza. Especially a fan of the GF crust!
Papa John's Pizza (Lethbridge),5,"Love it!
All the ingredients are fresh and have absolutely amazing taste. Kudos to the staff!"
Pizza Hut (1358 Mayor Magrath Drive South),1,Super disappointing when you spend over 40 for a pizza and 8 wings and come home realize the pizza is made very poorly. All the cheese was in the middle and chicken was all almost one side. Very sad to say they hire guys and give them no good training or show them a good standard. No I did not wanted to call and complain because it will not go anywhere. Done it in the past and they will block you. Just sad!
Pizza Hut (1358 Mayor Magrath Drive South),1,Server was rude. Server gave us the menu and said they don't offer lunch buffet because they have no staff. Yet they gave a menu that says they offer. Might want to not give the menu or offer it if you can't staff the place.  They use to be so good but now it's gone south.
Pizza Hut (1358 Mayor Magrath Drive South),1,"We waited 2 1/2 hours for our order and there was only 1 other family in the restaurant. WORSE SERVICE EVER! Went to restaurant to celebrate a birthday, totally ruined our night. Use to be a nice place to go especially for birthdays. NEVER NEVER AGAIN. I would advise anyone to go elsewhere."
Pizza Hut (1358 Mayor Magrath Drive South),1,This was the worst service I‚Äôve ever had. Took the waiter 45 minutes just to bring us our drinks
Pizza Hut (1358 Mayor Magrath Drive South),4,The food is good the service is slow . We waited 30 minutes for a Pepsi and a water ...
McDonald's (Scenic - Lethbridge #2),1,"Ordered 2 Mcwraps at july 10, 2023 8:15pm
The chicken & Bacon Mcwrap had no bacon at all."
McDonald's (Scenic - Lethbridge #2),1,The women manager there is absolutely horrible. She yelled at me at the drive through cause the person taking the order got it wrong. She was having trouble at the till. The difference was$0.20 for a med coffee and the worker ordered a small. I would of paid for it no problem. I have been going to that location for 30 years and will never go again. The service has slowed down also you always have to park and wait. The manager would not tell me the general manages name as she knew she was wrong for doing that. Pradhar you need to correct this manager and watch her with the staff she was quit rude to them also she needs to go! I was there June 21 at 1045 am so you know what manager that was.
McDonald's (Scenic - Lethbridge #2),2,"I have stopped here at least 6-8 times in the last year, and every single time, my order has come out with some mistake. If it was drive-thru, then I could maybe understand, but when I use the app to order, and everything is already marked down for them (no onions on a burger, for example), there's no excuse."
McDonald's (Scenic - Lethbridge #2),2,"I am sure drive thru is great, however, both times going inside the restaurant was not great. 10 minutes just for a large fries. And they remove your wait number before serving to make the stats look better."
McDonald's (Scenic - Lethbridge #2),1,"They constantly ask me to wait out front of the restaurant with my car while they finish making my latte. The wait is often an additional 6 to 10 minutes and more often than not the latte tastes so bitter that I can't even finish it. If you can't provide a half decent product, in a timely fashion, then you need to stop trying to provide that product. I have lost way too much money at this location."
Wendy's (230 Scenic Drive South),1,"Their app and Google says they close at 11:00p.m. on Saturdays. I placed an online order and arrived at 10:28p.m. on Saturday, July 15th and they were already closed? Nothing annoys me more than wasting my gas for businesses that can‚Äôt update their hours of operation."
Wendy's (230 Scenic Drive South),2,I normally go to the other Wendy's but today was on Scenic drive. I went through the drive through and spoke with an individual named Nash. He clearly hates his job and the customers. They gave me my food without my drinks so I had to ask for them. The difference in quality between the 2 stores is incredible. The burgers were smashed and clearly thrown together. Neither of us could eat it. I will NEVER return to this particular Wendy's again. We were very disappointed.
Wendy's (230 Scenic Drive South),1,"I've personally had enough of this location. Not only is my food, half the time never cooked properly or never right. Put 90% of the time when I try to come here at 9:30 or 9:45 they're closed. What's the point in even having a store if you're going to close it early?. Why even have it open?  Maybe you should change your hours of operations to 9:00 or 9:30. Because this getting here at 9:50 to find your drive-thru with cones in the way and your door locked , is 100% bad business. I hope Wendy's rectifies this. If not, gives a stern talking to this location. I've lived in this area for over 2 years and I've had more than a dozen times where I've had to go to the A&w across the street because they decide to close 15 minutes early"
Wendy's (230 Scenic Drive South),5,Love the food - best fast food money can buy. I particularly enjoy the atmosphere here. I hope they never renovate!
Wendy's (230 Scenic Drive South),4,It's Wendy's.... Food is Wendys and Wonderful fast.   The burger is fast....so is the fries üçü.  They got the mix your own flavor (movies theatre style) fountain drink station.   I love that.   And ask you should receive napkins (why oh why).... All the fast food restaurants are like this.
Taco Bell (West Lethbridge),1,I ordered bean tacos and nachos without ground beef almost 45 mins ago through the app and they sent me beef tacos and nachos. I almost didn‚Äôt realize until I took a bite of the taco and normally I wouldn‚Äôt ever write a review for an order mix up but for me consuming beef is a sin and against my faith. Definitely never ordering from taco bell again and compromising my faith for a meal.
Taco Bell (West Lethbridge),1,"What an absolute waste of time and money. The crunch wrap Supreme was pretty much just a tortilla with cheese. Next to no meat, and definitely no crunch. Thank goodness we ordered some KFC. The only thing that tasted good from Taco Bell was the Baja Blast"
Taco Bell (West Lethbridge),1,"Where to start, we haven‚Äôt had Taco Bell in over 2 years and had a craving so we decided to order online for pick up for family of 6.  Our order was missing all the fries, the portion sizes were so small, the hard tacos were about 1cm thick, soft tacos had barely any meat or cheese, just lettuce.. could barely tell the Gordita crunch apart from the hard tacos it was so small, I can‚Äôt believe we paid $80 for less than $25 worth of food. There was more meat of the nacho supreme than there was on the 3 soft tacos. Such a rip off!!"
Taco Bell (West Lethbridge),1,"I used to love going to this location. Last night my family waited in the drive thru for over 40 minutes. I left my car and went inside to an absolute gongshow! Lineup to the door, people waiting an hour for their food, but the staff was still pushing out skip orders. Went back to my car and spoke to the driver ahead of me, hadn't even taken their money, he was completely ignored when he tapped on the window. Apparently some staff was walking out. Close your doors and warn people at the drivethru if you can't keep up! Once you are in the drive-thru, you are stuck...once we were able to leave, many vehicles followed. Won't be going back :("
Taco Bell (West Lethbridge),1,"My daughter always gets a quesadilla with ground beef when we go through the drive through. We went inside this Saturday to eat in and they refused to do a ground beef quesadilla. The food was really not worth it, $70 for 4 small meals, never again. The server/cashier was rude and very short with us.  Most of the tables were dirty and the floor was extremely dirty.  Overall experience was subpar ü´§"
Teriyaki Madness (19 Southgate Blvd South),5,"Wow! Man the food is amazing here! I got the spicy chicken power bowl and it was delicious. Wasn't too spicy but did make my nose run a bit. The veggies tasted fresh, the chicken was cooked well and had a great sauce, and the noodles were so good they almost had a ""bouncy"" texture (weird word to use but that how they tasted). The regular size filled me and I normally eat a lot. Kids were happy, wife was happy, and I was happy with this experience. This is going to be my go-to spot from now on. A little pricey but I would say I don't get any better from a restaurant. Thank you owners for providing this in Lethbridge."
Teriyaki Madness (19 Southgate Blvd South),5,The food was really amazing. This place is worth spending your money. The flavours were perfect and blended with the ingredients very nicely. I have tried few of the dishes and it was amazing. The variety of foods is really awesome. I personally liked their tofu a lot and would not hesitate to have it daily. Every ingredient seems to compliment the type of dish. The meals are available at a very reasonable price. Food presentation is really mesmerizing. I highly recommend people to go check out their options. It‚Äôs worth it!!
Teriyaki Madness (19 Southgate Blvd South),5,Always amazing service and the food is delicious. Chicken Katsu from scratch with fried rice is my favorite!!
Teriyaki Madness (19 Southgate Blvd South),5,Had a great meal checking out this new place in Lethbridge. I had the spicy chicken bowl with fried rices and veggies and the orange chicken with noodles which was very good too. We did also get them made into a combo so we got a drink and an egg roll which was very good. The speed of the food was great only about 5 mins or so and the staff was very friendly and outgoing to make sure you had everything you need. Very clean and bright which was perfect for sitting down and having our meal their. Thanks team.
Teriyaki Madness (19 Southgate Blvd South),4,Edit October 2022: still not impressed with the food quality and price. The menu is small and I expected more for what I paid. - The food was good but nothing special. They do not have kids meals and the menu does not have a lot on it. The chicken and veggies were nice and hot but the rice was only warm. I didn't love the teriyaki sauce! It wasn't very flavorful. The noodles taste good but they are an extra charge. The price was ok but I can't say this place is any better than Edo. The staff was fantastic and so friendly and helpful.
Nori Bento & Udon Park Place,2,"I ordered Pork Tonkatsu for lunch. I liked how they prepped the pork but the accompanying rice was saggy. The veggies also looked liked they were stored in the freezer for ages - it also tasted very bland.
If I come to Park Place mall again, I will skip this place."
Nori Bento & Udon Park Place,5,"I'm so happy we still have a place to get a good bento at the mall! The food was prepared very quickly and it all tasted great. I had the beef bento and I honestly think their California rolls taste better than edo. It had rice, green salad, the rolls and yam tempura. I wish the salad had a carrot ginger dressing instead of the sesame but it was still tasty. The service was very polite and quick."
Nori Bento & Udon Park Place,5,"Decent food, staff were friendly. I had the chicken Bento and a side of shrimp tempura. I'd love to try their other menu options."
Nori Bento & Udon Park Place,5,"I recently ordered from Skip The Dishes and I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food. The pork katsu that I ordered was cooked to perfection, with a crispy exterior and a tender, flavorful interior. The rice was also fresh and cooked perfectly, and the sushi rolls were some of the best I've had. Overall, I was extremely satisfied with my experience!!"
Nori Bento & Udon Park Place,5,"I usually don‚Äôt stop at the food court but this place changes that!! Very good price and the food is so good! My friend recommended the pork katsu, it was exactly what I was craving!!"
Modern Chinese,4,The staff were great.  I have never been to a Chinese buffet quite like that before.  What they had was good but they didn't have what we expected.  There were no noodle dishes and there was no ginger beef or chicken.  There were no labels indicating what the dishes were  and they had some dishes I really couldn't correctly identify.  I love a little mystery but that is taking it too far for me.
Modern Chinese,5,BBQ Duck and beef with beans were awesome. Highly recommended! Thanks for hosting to the owner Donny.
Modern Chinese,5,I just rated this place check out my new dynasty rating this place is a must visit for Chinese in Lethbridge we don't have alot of good places for Chinese in Lethbridge but this one satisfies on every level from staff to their amazingly clean restaurant to the good food it's Chinese like how I remember mom bringing home as a child hands down the best egg rolls never to hard and the batter flavor is perfect the wor wonton soup has alot of stuff more then the typical 3 shrimp and 6 wonton you get lots and it's good the baby corns for some reason can be hard but everything else is perfect or don't even matter nd if you had an empty water glass here or seen a worker not in his/her best mood I'd be shocked
Modern Chinese,4,We got takeout for about five of us and the staff was friendly and the food was the best I've tasted in Lethbridge in a long time. The only real disappointment was the ginger beef being not spicy at all even when we asked it to be extra spicy.
Modern Chinese,5,Ordered bbq duck and beef with beans. The food is delicious. My family was entirely satisfied. Mr Don - owner of the restaurant is the best. 5 stars out of 5. Highly recommending.
Fusion BBQ & Hotpot,2,"Way better sushi than the other location. Food tastes fresh and good. The avocados were fresh and so were the mangos , cucumbers and other veggies. Would recommend.  Service was good , but food came out all at separate times, and it's better all at once so everyone can eat together instead of taking turns when the food comes out.
The last photo shows the veggie sushi platter.

Got a cup of pop and the cup was dirty inside. Got another one and it was also dirty."
Fusion BBQ & Hotpot,5,"Omg, it was delicious. It was my first experience with BBQ on the table and sushi at the same time. I highly recommend it. The atmosphere was great. I'm looking forward to visiting this place again."
Fusion BBQ & Hotpot,3,"Been coming here for awhile now, the food is usually pretty good but this last time I went my friends and I had a terrible experience. The service was slow, the food was inconsistent, and we had these gross floaties in our water."
Fusion BBQ & Hotpot,4,"Interesting concept, not sure why they don't do hotpot anymore... we did the BBQ all you can eat and it was fun, we ate quite a bit, although they only bring little at a time and sometimes some of the food you order never shows up either, maybe they forget or the food goes to a different table, not sure. We had to order the same thing more than once to at least get one order. It was very good though."
Fusion BBQ & Hotpot,5,"One of the best all you can eat Asian fusion!!!! The food is fantastic, including the best deep fried bananas for desert!!!! The staff is very friendly. The service was amazing and our server Charmaine did an amazing job!!!!
Cooking the meat on your own table is another level of experience in an all you can eat restaurant.
Well recommended!!!!"
Via Cibo (Lethbridge),5,"We were pleasantly surprised at the ambience of the place.
The excellent food, filling portions, friendly staff and cleanliness all added to the experience.
Ordered Primavera and garlic bread sticks, finishing off with Gelato and Tiramisu.
It was absolutely delicious!
We definitely plan on returning!"
Via Cibo (Lethbridge),5,"First time to dine here, and we weren‚Äôt disappointed. Their risotto and chicken parmigiana with alfredo pasta were very sumptuous! Excellent food and service! Thank you, we will surely come back! Thank you to the Chefs for the delicious foods..üòä"
Via Cibo (Lethbridge),5,"The broccoli and sausage pasta fettuccine was delicious, a wonderful portion size packed with flavor! The side ceaser salad was crunchy and had a great amount of dressing, croutons and bacon. The bread was soft yet crunchy and warm. The overall customer service here is phernomona,l I give this place  5 stars. Will be coming back."
Via Cibo (Lethbridge),3,"Apparently for the Tuesday Pasta offer you need to ask for it. Noticed was changed full price on till tape. Would  not refund difference after order was placed. Manager said nothing she could do. When food came, they came with a cash refund on the difference.  Food was good, tasty."
Via Cibo (Lethbridge),5,One of the best places to go. Service & food never disappoints. The Alfredo is my favorite. Will always be my go-to for pasta Tuesday!
Subway (Lethbridge Towne Sq.),5,"Sukh was so incredibly friendly snd kind. I scrambled in at 10:59pm and the restaurant was set to close at 11:00pm. She didn't shoo me away but instead tried to make me feel welcomed and valued. She was fast, efficient, and compassionate. She smiled, talked, and built genuine rapport. I felt respected and she didn't make me feel guilty or ashamed for coming right at closing. I really appreciated that.

Sukh was not only kind to me but she was also extremely kind and compassionate to two street people who came to buy something to eat and sit down to warm up. This meant a lot to me that she treated these customers with dignity and respect too.

I highly recommend this Subway based on my exceptional experience and customer service from Sukh."
Subway (Lethbridge Towne Sq.),1,"I ordered through the app for pick up. I get there 15 minutes later and they haven‚Äôt even started making the order. The store is not busy but there are 5 employees behind the counter.
They make the sandwiches but when I go to eat it‚Äôs such a mess all I  see is mayo and lettuce most things are not even inside the bread. So disappointed in this location"
Subway (Lethbridge Towne Sq.),1,Normally I woundnt do this but sang dnt go there when it's rush food prep is just ugly half my sandwiche just sticks to the bag
Subway (Lethbridge Towne Sq.),4,"Good food. Nice location, right across from hotel. Staff was friendly and quick."
Subway (Lethbridge Towne Sq.),5,Great lunch get away. Nice people always fast
Denny's (421 Mayor Magrath Dr),5,Fantastic service by john and gerry! They were very friendly the whole time and very accommodating! Restaurant Cleanliness was tip top! Food are delicious! Hopefully they could get some sort of recognition. Will definitely come back to Denny‚Äôs Lethbridge soon! üëç
Denny's (421 Mayor Magrath Dr),5,"Our server Fe was excellent! She was very observant if our drinks are almost empty, and checks up on us time to time if everything is good!"
Denny's (421 Mayor Magrath Dr),5,I just wanted to recognize Kate who was our server. The service she gave was impeccable and great. She was so attentive and gave us good recommendations what to get. Very good restaurant for having breakfast specially if you‚Äôre staying on the neighbour hotel. Because of her we keep coming back every morning.
Denny's (421 Mayor Magrath Dr),5,"I have not been to Denys for years but I'm supper glad I cam back. Jayant was awesome and so fast with everything. He didn't forget one thing and was supper attentive.
Denise has really good prices.
The Chocolate chip banana pancakes were amazing!!! üòç"
Denny's (421 Mayor Magrath Dr),1,"Would leave a 0 star review if I could. After we ordered our food and drinks, the server did not come to our table to refill our coffee and sodas. At one point while I was looking around for a server to refill my coffee, I noticed that there was not a single server on the floor. 5-10 minutes later I seen three servers entering the restaurant with beverages not from the restaurant. When the food was brought to our table, they did not bring the sauces we had requested when we ordered the food. The worst complaint was that the fried fish had a mushy, gooey liquid seeping from it. We sent the food back, at that point the manager returned holding a piece of the fish. He very rudely told us that the fish was fine to eat and he ate it in front of us. He had a take it or leave it attitude. Never have I experienced such rudeness and disrespect from a restaurant manager. He walked away from our table, and we were left in disbelief at what had just happened. After I had time to process, I asked to speak with the manager. I expressed my disgust in witnessing his behavior. He did not take my complaint seriously and was very dismissive. I then realized that the manager did not care about my experience or opinion. I then asked for a corporate contact email to direct my complaint. He was reluctant to give me a corporate email address to direct my complaint to, he never actually did. It was only after threat of taking my complaint further did his demeanor change. He became apologetic and told us that we would not have to pay for our entire meal. At that point, the damage was done. Our table did not receive any service following my complaint, nobody came to refill our drinks, check on our table, or even clear the table after we finished our meals."
7-Eleven (680 Columbia Blvd W),5,"Besides them being a really solid/cheap option for pizza, I had ordered on the app and picked the wrong crust. Called in and asked to change it and they said they would despite it already being in the oven! I didn't take them up on that because I know kitchen work is a pain as is but really appreciated the effort to go above and beyond despite my screw up. Good crew y'all have."
7-Eleven (680 Columbia Blvd W),5,"We have ordered from this Domino's many times and it's always fast, hot, and consistent quality. One order really stands out to us though. Last night there was a mixup on the app with our address (old address vs new one). Shelby - our delivery person - took the time to call and text me to confirm everything as no one answered the door. She promptly brought our food to the correct address which was completely out of the way for her. She was super cheerful about the whole incident and we truly appreciated her extra efforts to make sure we had a positive experience. Thank you =)"
7-Eleven (680 Columbia Blvd W),2,"The first time we ordered, my wife's pizza slid to one side and became a big mess. Also the dip we paid for exploded on top of the box.  The second time they left toppings off, and refused to replace the dip. Since the driver made the pizza and argued with me, we didn't bother calling to complain. NOT IMPRESSED at all."
7-Eleven (680 Columbia Blvd W),4,Like any chain the quality can vary a lot depending on who is making the food. But even at its worst it‚Äôs always good and the price is right. Best pizza per dollar value in town unless you‚Äôre making the dough from scratch.
7-Eleven (680 Columbia Blvd W),4,"We got our free pizza after the botch-up of our previous order.  The Works pizza had had nothing on it except sauce and the two items we added extra.  The mistake was so blatant it was laughable.
These people have the best crust in town though. Great service and willingness to keep the customer happy."
"Dairy Queen (516 13th Street North, Lethbridge)",5,Stopped for a quick lunch. Ordered double mushroom burger with cheese and fries plus mini blizzard. Along with $8:00 meal. Witch came with single cheese fries and drink plus sundae. The burger was hot and fries were hot. Mushroom sauce was delicious. The service was fast.
"Dairy Queen (516 13th Street North, Lethbridge)",4,I got the super snack deal. 2 cheeseburgers for 6$. The food was Mid but the gloomy atmosphere added to the vibe. The drink prices are daytime robbery though. Not this locations fault but 2.69 for a small drink. Unlimited refills made it worth it for me though. Can't imagine not having that refill option though. This would apply for anyone going through the drive-through. Overall 4/5. Good work DQ
"Dairy Queen (516 13th Street North, Lethbridge)",5,"My go-to DQ. Never disappoints. The food & drinks here are always made well. Employees have always been welcoming. Plus,there‚Äôs almost always a good selection of pre made cakes in the freezer."
"Dairy Queen (516 13th Street North, Lethbridge)",1,"Our order was 2 sundaes, 2m8lkshakes ans a small cone.  They put tge shakes and cones in drink tray but pushed them downstairs when reached for it spilled all over me and the interior of my vehicle.  No napk8ns were offered I had to ask and no apology was offered.  Never going back.  Poor service"
"Dairy Queen (516 13th Street North, Lethbridge)",5,"I usually use skip to order.  The onion rings are perfect with whole pieces of onion not that minced stuff at other restaurants üôÑ.   We usually always order ice cream of some sort
Let's face it Dairy Queen has the best soft serve ever.  Blizzards..delicious Peanut parfait ..mmmyummy. You will never regret ice cream üç¶"
Fatburger (1505 Mayor Magrath Drive S),5,"Easily the best burgers in town, the atmosphere and personality is unmatched. And the employees are always in an excellent mood. When I think hamburger restaurant, Fatburger is the first thing to come to mind. Burgers actually look like the pictures"
Fatburger (1505 Mayor Magrath Drive S),5,"Ordered a CB Deluxe Burger, also kids meals for the kids. Honestly, the CB, listen, burning hot patty topped with crispy bacon, lettuce, pickles, cheese, mustard, tomatoes and oinions.... making it easily to my all time top 3 burgers, without hesitation.
In addition, their kids meal, what a great value, unbeatable! My go-to restaurant in town. Never disappointed. Thanks Fatburger!"
Fatburger (1505 Mayor Magrath Drive S),5,"Yam fries and the vegetarian California burger and those mini doughnuts with the caramel sauce, I was stuffed. Clean fast friendly.. see you again Fatburgesa"
Fatburger (1505 Mayor Magrath Drive S),5,"WOW WOW N DOUBLE WOW!!!
HAVE had there yummy burgers a few times over the past couple weeks.
I've never been disappointed by the taste or the potion sizes. Staff is very friendly. It's always nice when you hear your name as you walk in.
Very good food and good place all around.
Keep up the awesome work Fatburger staff..."
Fatburger (1505 Mayor Magrath Drive S),4,"Been a while but my Burger was really good, yam fries were not. I'll just stick with poutines. We ordered out so didn't get to see staff. But definitely going back."
Firestone Restaurant & Bar,4,"The service was quick and the atmosphere was chill. Our server was very friendly and answered any questions we had. The food was mediocre though. The sandwich I had was so garlicky I could barely eat it. Some other food was rather plain, or small. Great fries and desserts though!"
Firestone Restaurant & Bar,4,"I think it's a popular restaurant with a lot of people.
The atmosphere was good and the server was very kind and nice.
But the food didn't suit our taste.
Especially the clam soup was too salty, so I couldn't taste anything from the main dish that came after.
I think it will take time for us to revisit"
Firestone Restaurant & Bar,5,Food was very good but service was very slow. My beef tenderloins were a little overcooked but the potatoes were very good. Wife‚Äôs prime rib dinner was excellent. Lots of good desserts to choose from.  Will be back for sure next time I‚Äôm in town.
Firestone Restaurant & Bar,3,"I went to Firestone today with my bf, his sister in law and her daughter for lunch. My bfs sister in law was there before us and had ordered some drinks. When my bf and I arrived, we sat and waited for the waiter to come by and ask for our drink orders. He came by about 20-30 minutes after we were seated and handed us menus. When he came back to take our orders, my bf and I ordered our meals and drinks. The waiter apologized for not taking our drink orders when he came by the first time. We waited a long time for our food. Maybe 45 minutes to an hour. The food smelled good and looked good. My bf got a burger meal, the sister in law got a sandwich meal, and her daughter got a chicken strip kids meal. I ordered a BBQ COBB SALAD. In all honesty, all of our meals could have been made at home. However, my COBB SALAD was actually really tasty and fulfilling. I had to package up the rest to take home. All in all, it was okay. The final costs for our meals weren't too bad but a little pricey for the portions. We may return, but it's undecided at this point."
Firestone Restaurant & Bar,2,"Although we had a reservation, they were going to push tables together and seat us in the bar. We asked for the dining room and were told that table was reserved- - 2 hours in the future, but they relented when we acknowledged we‚Äôd be done by then. 3 of 6 meals were satisfactory. Stating a preference of soft poached was met with excuses and an uncomfortable visit from the manager who asked three times if she could redo the eggs, but by the time our table was checked on, the food had already been eaten. No other option to make it right was presented. On top of it all they forgot the fruit! Pictured was the most amazing taco salad. Conclusion- dinner at home would have been more enjoyable."
IHOP (1818 Mayor Mcgrath Drive South),5,"Great service. Very quick and friendly. Everything tasted great! *Note, I did come on a Monday, so it wasn't as busy as the weekend*"
IHOP (1818 Mayor Mcgrath Drive South),5,The Spicy Shredded Beef Burrito Bowl and pancakes are delicious üëå and the service is great! They even have a special syrup that they offer to those who have dietary concerns. ü•∞So it's less sugar than the regular syrup.
IHOP (1818 Mayor Mcgrath Drive South),5,Ishita is the most friendly waitress. Best omelets always but the new thick and fluffy vanilla cinnamon French toast is A Must Try. You will not be disappointed.
IHOP (1818 Mayor Mcgrath Drive South),3,"The food used to be pretty good, but we've noticed quality has taken a bit of a turn for the worst. We also ordered 2 items and it took them 55 minutes to get us our order. It's just okay, nothing special. The crepes in particular just looked.... sad. Also we ran to the bathroom shortly after we ate.... usually this isn't an issue."
IHOP (1818 Mayor Mcgrath Drive South),5,"We went there as a group of 16. And i know how challenging it is to serve a large group of people but the server was patient and was very pleasant. She also met everyones needs. The Restaurant Manager also visited our table and made sure that we have everything we need, took a picture of us and was very accomodating. The wait time for the food was also fast, given that we are a large group. The experience was excellent like always!"
Popeyes (1814 Mayor Magrath Dr S),5,"POPEYES SPICY CHICKEN is SOOO GOOD!!!
The STAFF and MANAGER were EXTREMELY FRIENDLY and ACCOMMODATING because MY
ORDER of ‚ÄúSPICY ALL WHITE MEAT with 2 RIBS
and 2 BREASTS‚Äù is NOT SO COMMON.
The SPICY FRIES and ONION RINGS were also
VERY TASTY!!!"
Popeyes (1814 Mayor Magrath Dr S),4,"Louisiana fried chicken has a best location in town to attract all the customers they can well-lit up place with adequate service. Online orders, stay in to eat sit on a patio, can do a drive thou it‚Äôs all good"
Popeyes (1814 Mayor Magrath Dr S),5,Always hot and fresh with great speed and good prices. It‚Äôs fast food quality but the chicken is always top notch no matter what form of chicken you get.
Popeyes (1814 Mayor Magrath Dr S),1,"This is the fourth time they have messed up an order. I don‚Äôt make a big deal the first or second time but if there is mistakes happening every time we go in I think it‚Äôs time they get new management and employees. Don‚Äôt get me wrong they‚Äôre nice people just a horrible business. Wrong food and drinks, cold food every time we go in, drive thru takes so long I turn off my car to not waste gas. I hate the Popeyes in south Lethbridge they need to do better."
Popeyes (1814 Mayor Magrath Dr S),3,"we come here relatively often and sometimes the food/service is great! but sometimes it is really not‚Ä¶ frequently missing order items (especially if you order on skip). ordered 2 biscuits tonight and received zero. sometimes service is less than friendly. they told us it was gonna be a 10 minute way for chicken (absolutely fine!) so we parked in the lot to wait. but then when the food was ready, they just opened the drive thru window and hung the bag out so we had to walk up to the window to grab our food. not the biggest deal but i‚Äôve also never had that happen anywhere before so it was definitely odd. chicken is yum but overall, can be quite disappointing sometimes :/"
Osmow's Lethbridge,5,"The food is so gooodddd.
Orders Falafet signature creation and Just got to know that they fry their fries when they get order. Not like Mcd they give us pre-fried fried.
So freshness guaranteed."
Osmow's Lethbridge,4,"The wait was a little long (25-30 minutes for two shawarma wraps) but it was really good!
I wish I would have asked about the spice level before ordering it medium, delicious but my mouth was on fire the entire time üòÖ"
Osmow's Lethbridge,4,"According to the staff, the whole menu was HALAL, but I didn't see any signs or boards that were in front of the customers.
The quality of the food was good but not great."
Osmow's Lethbridge,1,"[UPDATED] I don‚Äôt typically add a review to a rating when I rate it a one star unless it is so bad that people need to be warned. However this time, after leaving a rating Osmow‚Äôs replied to my rating asking for a review to know why I rated it only one star, so here it is.

The ‚Äúhalf and half chicken shawarma‚Äù was flavourless compared to other Osmow‚Äôs I‚Äôve tried. There was lots of cartilage in the chicken (or something else with the same mouth feel and taste). The proportions were also nearly half of other Osmow‚Äôs, nearly every other Osmow‚Äôs I‚Äôve been to loads every size up so much that the garlic sauce is all smooshed on the top of the container, and they don‚Äôt just load up the rice/fries they load up the protein.

I was excited to hear an Osmow‚Äôs was built in Lethbridge after having it all the time when I lived in Ontario. Unfortunately the location here was a real let down. Maybe someone else that has never had the good stuff would say this place is amazing, unfortunately I cannot because I know what the Osmow‚Äôs Shawarma branded Shawarma is supposed to taste like."
Osmow's Lethbridge,4,"The vegan sauce is really good. It would be nice if there was more veggies in it, so youre eating more than bread and falafel and sauce. Veggies really enhance the flavour. The falafel is crispy and has good flavour. This is the 12 inch falafel wrap with most of the veggies and the vegan sauce. The service was really quick. Overall would be more likely to return if there was more veggies inside the wraps."
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (University Dr),4,"Had quesada for dinner and it was delicious! Lots of variety of toppings and their sauces are great. Built my own bowl and had the chipotle tofu as my protein. Wish they gave more fillings as it felt like it was so little especially the rice, lettuce and veggies!"
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (University Dr),5,"By far the best Burrito in town! The staff is also sooo friendly every single time I've been in there, they make me feel so comfortable and have really turned my day around a few times just by being so positive and friendly towards me!
The food has a really good fresh homemade taste to it too!"
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (University Dr),1,"Im from out of town but am staying in Lethbridge for a few days for work. I ordered a bowl on Uber eats after work today and it was laughably bad.. first off I don‚Äôt think it came with any sauce. Just a dry bowl of lettuce and rice. I paid extra for grilled chicken, when it arrived I thought something was a little strange as they were trying to hide the one or two minuscule pieces of chicken that they had put on the bowl. Being hungry from work I devoured this thing. I realized at about the end of the bowl something in there had to be bad as I started throwing up about 10 minutes after eating it, and haven‚Äôt stopped yet. It‚Äôs hard anytime to pin point where food poisoning comes from. That being said I don‚Äôt eat lunch at work and I hadn‚Äôt been sick all day from breakfast. Food safety aside. This was the worst e tasting bowl I‚Äôve ever had. As if it wasn‚Äôt bad enough I had to taste it twice.. It was hard to believe they have the ratings that they do here. I would NOT recommend this place to a friend lol. STAY THE F AWAY."
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (University Dr),2,"I ordered from here last night through skip the dishes.

The tacos were spot on with flavor, although when I tried to lift them out of the box, the entire bottom of my hard shell taco was SOGGY and I was left with a very sloppy and messy taco.

Not to mention my order was over $25, so if I'm going to pay that much for 3 hard shell tacos, I expect them to be quality. I could have went to taco time or taco bell and gotten better quality. This was VERY disappointing.

I certainly will not be spending my money  especially that much, on tacos that are just going to fall apart that badly. Oh, I will attach photos too."
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (University Dr),5,Third day in a row. Great service and good ambience. Fresh food with well maintained cleanliness and great customer experience.
KFC West Lethbridge,5,"Placed a large order on skip ten minutes before they closed for skip, and not only did the accept the order, they made everything fresh, and even included an extra piece of extra crispy. Excellent work on the part of the closing staff. Will definitely order again."
KFC West Lethbridge,1,Didn‚Äôt pay attention to the reviews which were pretty negative. My husband drove into town to the westside outlet. After a confusing interaction with the order taking staff over crispy coating and the other coating he finally purchased a $30 bucket. Our order was not only very dry chicken but was the spicy recipe which was not what we ordered. Very disorderly.
KFC West Lethbridge,1,"Poorest fried chicken bucket I‚Äôve ever purchased in that it was not the Kentucky recipe for the chicken I remember. This had hot spice probably cayenne or hot paprika. Ate one piece each & had to throw away cause was too, too hot for this senior. Had to drive in from a small town west of lethbridge. Pity we won‚Äôt buy again. Should have told us the super dry fried coarse coating was hot. Pity. They‚Äôve lost my business."
KFC West Lethbridge,1,Lol. This food is trash. Memories of what KFC used to taste like got me here. Don't fall for it people. If you've never made fried chicken at home before don't hesitate to try because it'll still be better than this rubbish. Stale dry biscuits. Watery gravy. Save your money. Just trash.
KFC West Lethbridge,2,"Gave this place two chances incase it was a one off.

The first time, we got to the drive thru at 10:30pm. An hour before closing. Got to the drive thru speaker, waited 5 minutes before anyone even said hello.

Waited 37 mins for food, fussy baby in the car. Definitely would not have gone through if we knew it would be around 45 mins wait time.

Second time, we ordered online and got it delivered. The website said it would arrive by 9:10. (40 mins wait time) which is fine. But the food didn't actually come until 9:40pm. Something didn't actually taste right with the gravy, so we ended up just dumping it. Tasted a little sour.

Leaving 2 stars because the chicken was still good. Definitely better at other places."
Green Wok,1,"Wouldn't order again, some of the saddest most dry Chinese food that I have ever had. The meat on the right side was supposed to be honey garlic chicken... where is the honey garlic? Food tasted like days old left overs."
Green Wok,5,First time ordering to go from here and had a great all around experience from start to finish. The food was great and can't wait to try other menu items
Green Wok,4,"Went for lunch, ate in. I had salt and pepper chicken, vegetables  and noodles, was very good. Large portions. Service was great."
Green Wok,5,I go here often for the wonton soup. I love their soup. Best in Lethbridge in my opinion. Great location for me as well.
Green Wok,4,"Great soup and environment, portion sizes are more than enough to feed two people. I had the soup and chow mein special during my visit and have some pros and cons.
Pros:
- The portion size is huge, almost too much but you can ask for a to-go container
- The soup was really good and contained lots of vegetables
Cons:
- The chow mein was served on a paper plate where the cutlery and soup bowl were actual kitchenware
- The chow mein was a bit on the runny side with excess sauce applied to it

Overall not bad, some improvement on the stir-fry dishes could help but everything else seems good"
Tim Horton's (442 Scenic Dr),1,This store needs to get competent workers. I order sausage on an everything croissant with Chipotle sauce and cheese.  I get bacon no sauce. This store has really gone down hill. Rather quite sad it is owned by very nice people . The staff Should take pride in their work and do it right.
Tim Horton's (442 Scenic Dr),1,"I wish I could give this Tim Hortons a zero star for their night staff. it‚Äôs march 11, 2023, and the time is 11:03. I work everyday for night sift, I always have to have coffee before my work from this Tim. These girls at night never smile, show attitude, don‚Äôt even wish thank you, good night or anything. They should learn work presentation and should wish their customer with smile. They rude face sometimes spoil my day as well. It would be known that a one smile can change ones day. I understand sometimes we don‚Äôt feel good and can‚Äôt smile or wish people but it is happening everyday night to me. I posting this to get a positive attitude in future.
Please and thank you"
Tim Horton's (442 Scenic Dr),5,A great Tim Hortons to visit in Lethbridge. The food and service was amazing! The only thing I would change is that there was no seating available for me as all the tables were taken so I had to eat my Flatbread pizza in the car.
Tim Horton's (442 Scenic Dr),1,They messed up my order. They put beef in my order I am pure vegetarian and religious and their staff tries to hurt my religious beliefs.
Tim Horton's (442 Scenic Dr),1,"This one has the rudest customer service I've ever experienced. My coffee is always wrong and if I go back to have it fixed heaven forbid.

Edit: no Tim Hortons I'm not going to the link you sent me. You want me to go to a link and fill out a whole form due to this , yet you literally have managers acting terrible in there with the rudest employees with multiple complaints and have done nothing. Do better. Go off the reviews and fix it."
New York Fries (Park Place),5,Awesome service & staff!! And of course the chili cheese dog!
New York Fries (Park Place),5,"I find myself scarfing down poutines from this place more often than not. Friendly staff, absolutely DEADLY poutines, and they constantly sauce me coupons to keep me coming back. On days where I think I have a poutine problem, I am enabled by NYF... thank you for your amazing job NYF Park Place "
New York Fries (Park Place),5,"My fav place to goü•∞..best fries nd always taste so good. Staff is so friendly and kind. Richard and Yulanda is awesome‚Ä¶ nd the other staff members are nice too!!! I always have a good experience going there!! Love this place
‚ô•Ô∏èüå∏"
New York Fries (Park Place),5,"The gentleman at checkout was super nice (he had a wrist brace on, if you‚Äôre reading this Mr. Gentleman!) and the food was pretty good and quick to arrive. Thanks!"
New York Fries (Park Place),5,Very good. The Hawaii lookin guy was real kind. Why do you only have one drink size tho? That‚Äôs kinda whack
Onion Bar & Grill / Flamingo,5,Holly served us and kept us entertained the whole night. After what looked like a really busy night she still made sure to be attentive with our service. Everyone else u hire in the future should learn from her how to do it and she needs a gigantic raise cuz she offers the same level of service every time we come here.
Onion Bar & Grill / Flamingo,1,"Don't work here, especially in the kitchen, Corey the manager does not have any respect for his workers, even when they try to do the right protocol, and is very judgmental of his employees personal lives, and likes to bash his employees boyfriend who he does not even know. Having no self respect for their employees."
Onion Bar & Grill / Flamingo,2,Went in on a Friday evening and this was my third time going in but first time with such a let down. Service was neglectful. Ordered a virgin Caesar without tobasco but ended up getting one with and burnt the inside of my mouth. Asked the waitress for another and that took about 15 minutes to get it. Ordered our food and that took about 1 hour before it was served. Waitress was rarely seen to the point where we would ask other servers for what we needed. Nobody ever bothered coming back to refill our water which we had to ask for at the tail end of the meal. We were there 90 minutes and ate and ran. Food was ok but was so chocked  about the whole experience that by the time we started eating I just wanted out of there and lost my appetite. Totally dysfunctional and unprofessional and no apologies from any staff member.
Onion Bar & Grill / Flamingo,5,Oooohhh. The food is good here. Service is good.  The steak is so good. To would never expect that steak would be something you should order there.  Happy hour is happy.  Highly recommend.
Onion Bar & Grill / Flamingo,4,"Went for the boneless ribs, they were a little dry. Quantity was good though and the crunch was nice.

The best is the atmosphere. Everything is wood and brass and a real (oak?) Made for an old school experience."
Whitbie's Fish & Chips,5,"Wow, fantastic food and service. Great prices and selection of menu items. Nice clean and quiet restaurant. Great daily specials. Super fresh and tasty."
Whitbie's Fish & Chips,5,"We were blown away by the food here. The batter on the fish was amazing, very light and crispy. And we got the chips of war, which was very delicious. Also the portions were more than filling, and the staff was super nice. Awesome!"
Whitbie's Fish & Chips,5,"My husband and I go here once a month for a lunch date. The food is always so delicious and made fresh. The staff are always so friendly and attentive through out our visit there.
We love going here and would reccomend this place for anyone wanting an authentic east coast fish and chips."
Whitbie's Fish & Chips,5,"We had read good things about this place back in 2016, but we don‚Äôt live in Lethbridge so we did not have the opportunity to try it until now. The fish & chips were absolutely first rate. I really liked that you could get curry sauce with the chips; last time I had that was in Ireland, long ago. Very friendly folks; good value for the money."
Whitbie's Fish & Chips,5,"Phenomenal food. The fish and chips is made right in front of you and it comes to your table hot. Crisp batter over tender fish with tasty fries, might be the best I've had in town by a longshot."
Edo Japan -  Park Place Mall,4,"We had Edo Japan this weekend. I ordered Sukiyaki Beef and my boyfriend had beef and shrimp. It was like a fast food restaurant. After we ordered them, the cook began to cook our dishes. The food came very fast and fresh. Tasty and Yummy."
Edo Japan -  Park Place Mall,5,I got a really good serving of the food I wanted and the service was great also really enjoyed the Bubble tea
Edo Japan -  Park Place Mall,5,The original and still the best one in the city. Ask for extra veggies and they are generous
Edo Japan -  Park Place Mall,5,I love their food so much and I love that it's freshly cooked in front of you and very healthy! The staff are always so friendly.
Edo Japan -  Park Place Mall,5,"Awesome, good quality meals, hot food according to your palatable taste.
Very friendly staff."
Taco Del Mar,2,"I've been coming here for years and have had great service, good food. Tonight will likely be the last. It took us 15 minutes to talk a guy through making our food and he put tiny amounts of everything on. Enchiladas shouldn't have one teaspoon of sauce on it and hardly any meat. The new plates are much smaller as well. Not impressed. Both plates weigh less together than one used to."
Taco Del Mar,4,Recently moved from BC to Calgary and was disappointed to see there are no Taco Del Mar locations in town but luck would have it I had a few days work in Lethbridge and found they have a hidden gem. Love their burritos
Taco Del Mar,4,"The food was good.   The place was clean.    This is very important.    If your restaurant is even just a little bit messy and unclean.   It's a red flag.
This place was super clean and tidy.
Happy people working."
Taco Del Mar,3,"Good fast food. Wannabe mexican, but with good taste. A little bit on the spicy and pricey side"
Taco Del Mar,5,"I had the lobster tacos. Wow. Fresy, d√©licious,, with the perfect combination of the tangy verde salsa and the cilantro. I really felt thar I was somewhere in a beach restaurante."
Tea Bliss,2,"The waitress was nice but the owner was not welcoming at all. There is a distinct rotting/wet wood smell throughout the restaurant, it's even worse in the washrooms. I ordered a half beef dip sandwich, it was made on a squished hotdog bun, it tasted mediocre at best. The food gave me a really upset stomach along with a super fun case of diarrhea.
This particular Smitty's used to be a good place to eat, years ago, but I feel as if the owner has given up."
Tea Bliss,4,We rolled into Lethbridge at 8 pm after driving 11 hours and were starving. They were closing but still managed to whip up some chicken and mashed potatoes for us. Great customer service. We will visit often.
Tea Bliss,5,"Amazing food as always! It was my friends first time and they said it was way better than expected and they'll be coming back! They got an Eggs Benedict, my other friend got Nachos and they smelled so good! I have been coming to Smittys since I was born, the managers got moved from my location to this one when Center village malls location got closed and the great service transfered over!"
Tea Bliss,5,Always enjoyable with great staff and food. Love buying their cute dish towels and clothes.
Tea Bliss,5,Very friendly and the food was awesome. Will definitely be back!!!
Makisu Sushi Lethbridge,2,Great food . . . BUT.  This restaurant steals their wait staffs tips!  If you try to give a waitress a tip they are supposed to direct you to the front of the house tip jar.  The waitresses and workers get nothing and the owners keep it for themselves.  If the wait staff are caught keeping tips they get in trouble.  This is outrageous and as a customer i would never go back knowing this.  I know this as I know 2 people that used to work here.  We had taken a large party here and the wait staff were amazing and worked hard for us.  I tried to leave them a good sizable tip but then was told this.
Makisu Sushi Lethbridge,3,"It's a good place for all you can eat. I didn't get even half of my order. When I re-ordered, some of the items were missed. The quality of the food is just ok, nothing outstanding."
Makisu Sushi Lethbridge,5,"The food was really good. Order your food ahead of time though, if you are looking yo do take out, they tend to get too busy during dinner time."
Makisu Sushi Lethbridge,3,"Order well before the supper rush, or you will wait quite a while.  Overall, the The food is better than average.  The restaurant is tiny, and usually crowded, so I don't recommend dining in."
Makisu Sushi Lethbridge,5,I‚Äôve been to Makisu quite a few times now for all you can eat sushi and it‚Äôs consistently excellent. The menu has lots of variety and everything I‚Äôve tried has been great. The service is quick and the food is always fresh. I can‚Äôt wait to go back!
Apna tandoori hut,5,"Awesome food and super excellent customer service by lady named Simran. She served me and my mom with nice smiley & service was prompt. Food quality was awesome !!! We ordered kadai panner, chapati, tandoori roti, lassi. Taste was nice authentic however I feel quantity was little less for vegetable but again prices are also less compared to others. Ambiance is nice ! View of street makes it feel good."
Apna tandoori hut,5,"Excellent service-
Great food-
Chai was just like I would make at home.
Very clean! You can see the cooks from the dinning room.
Try the Aloo Tikki
Gobi paratha
Onion bhajee
Chicken tikka was melt in your mouth says my hubby since I am a vegetarian.

Great job guys.keep it up.
The best Indian food in Lethbridge."
Apna tandoori hut,5,"The food is amazing, with a wide variety of dishes to choose from, all expertly prepared and full of flavor. The service was also top-notch, with friendly and attentive staff. Overall, I highly recommend apna tandoori hut"
Apna tandoori hut,5,"The food tasted amazing at this location, the spice level and flavour of the food was on point. Dine in experience was really great aswell nice and clean with colorful decoration. Would highly recommend this place."
Apna tandoori hut,5,Amazing. Best Indian food I've had in a long time. The decorations were adorable!!! The food was rich and so healthy and tasty and I have a food allergy that they accommodate. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
Lighthouse Japanese Restaurant,5,"I don't know how to say this properly, This is the best sushi that I have ever tasted, and the selection of fish is incredible! Among the best in Canada! I had the Tuna and Salmon 8-piece Ngiri Sushi, 1 piece of mackerel & 1 red snapper Ngiri Sushi and 1 calamari house salad. Couldn't be happier! Thank you Lighthouse!!"
Lighthouse Japanese Restaurant,3,"We visited for the first time last week. Our server didn't smile at us. When I looked around the store while eating, none of the three servers in the store laughed. There was no laughter the whole time we were in the restaurant. It wasn't rude, but it didn't feel kind. We ordered a love boat and an octopus sonomono, and the sonomono was so delicious. The Love Boat was small compared to other sushi restaurants, but it was not special. It was a restaurant I really wanted to visit, but it wasn't a pleasant experience for us."
Lighthouse Japanese Restaurant,4,Friendly customer service from Izzy. We asked about her recommendations on the menu and she gave a few options. Green tea was hot. California Roll & Rainbow Roll were fresh & delicious. Prices comparable to all other sushi places in Lethbridge. Nice atmosphere. Place was full for lunch hour.
Lighthouse Japanese Restaurant,5,"Good food, made fresh. I saw some other comments about portion size being small but I disagree.  This was a standard portion size and I left full.

It was quiet in the place tonight but the service was friendly and quick. Thank you."
Lighthouse Japanese Restaurant,4,"This place was very lovely and welcoming. The quality of the sushi was great, however the portion size was not that large. Cost was average. This wasn‚Äôt an all you can eat place. The seafood tasted clean and more fresh than other places I have tried in Lethbridge. The chicken bowl was flavourful with a good sauce to rice ratio. Chicken tasted fresh and moist. We finished it off which some ice cream and the green tea ice cream was delicious and perfectly sweetened. The server was very kind and knowledgeable. This is the place to go if you want to sit down with a friend for a quick bite. I also had a chance to try their appletini which was pleasantly delightful."
The Dirty Burger Company,2,"The ""dirty burger"" was a solid 7/10. Burger had a lightly toasted bun (9/10) and the pickles were a KNOCKOUT 10/10 but the meat was very bland (3/10). The garlic fries were TERRIBLE; dry but somehow floppy, hardly any cheese and had no taste of garlic parm. Poutine was an absolute abomination. The fries in the poutine were bland, unsalted and also wet/floppy. I'm not sure if they forgot the gravy in the poutine, or the fries soaked it all up. Overall VERY displeased. For a single burger, double burger(both of which were $17.50 somehow?) a poutine and two orders of ""garlic fries"" coming in at $50, I can see why it was so cheap. I will stick with Apollo and will not be returning."
The Dirty Burger Company,5,"So glad we decided to try Dirty Burger finally! I had the Simp with dirty fries & my husband had the Dirty Classic with samosas - both meals were awesome! Absolutely delicious burgers, and the fries were the best I've had in a long time. The samosas had great flavour and the pastry was really nice and flaky. The price is right for the quality of food that you receive. We don't have a single complaint and we will definitely be back to try more! üòä"
The Dirty Burger Company,5,"Great customer service and very clean restaurant. The burgers were great. The samosas were exceptional along with the yummy chutney to compliment it. Will go again to try more items, especially the pies. I was told they have halal options but wasn't available at that moment. Best to ask before going there."
The Dirty Burger Company,5,"Actually 4.5 stars. Overall all dishes are so good, we tried the simp fries, garlicky fries, classic burger, chicken burger, a maple milkshake and a raspberry fresher. The only comment we had was that the sauces were unremarkable. The staff are friendly and service is adequate.

We were also gifted the veggie samosas and they were really good too."
The Dirty Burger Company,5,"One of my favorite spots to eat in Peterborough. Their food is immaculate, some highlights are the Dirty Classic, one of the best burgers I've ever tasted, their Dirty Fries and Onion Rings are spectacular, and the Dirty Shakes, especially the Apple Pie Milkshake, are to die for.
If you get a chance to try their brunch menu, you will not be disappointed. Absolutely spectacular, the chicken and waffles especially.
The servers are always friendly, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. My favorite part about dining in is how every table has a deck of playing cards that you can play with, which is a lot of fun!
My only complaint is that the prices can feel a little high, but everything else is great so I can look past it!"
Pizza Hut (705 George Street North),1,ordered two pizzas and both didnt have sauce for some reason??? wont be coming back. worst pizza place ive been to in a while
Pizza Hut (705 George Street North),1,"I placed an order for pickup and decided to eat inside with my friends, everything was fine until I bit into a piece of my pizza and a hair got stuck in my braces, now I wouldn‚Äôt have been upset if it had came from my own head, but this was a small black hair and I am ginger and none of the people I was with had black hair especially not that length. When I went to tell this to the George street employees not wanting free food but maybe just some accountability, I was told it was ‚Äúphysically impossible‚Äù and the staff members started laughing and giving me dirty looks. I know I didn‚Äôt place that hair there and I didn‚Äôt want a hair off of someone else‚Äôs body in my mouth. Not to mention I did not see one hairnet on any of their heads and the man calling this hair impossible had short black hair. I work in fast food and my boss would never let me not wear a hairnet, not to mention knowing how unhygienic this restaurant is, employees using week old water to clean which they only do once a week. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend eating here unless you want extra hair on your pizza."
Pizza Hut (705 George Street North),5,"Food & staff were amazing üëè
Best pizza I've had in a LONG time! Was the perfect pre-soccer picnic meal."
Pizza Hut (705 George Street North),1,Worst location ever staff doesn‚Äôt not give  a single fork about you or your pizza they are always slow and slacking . As you can see in the picture they can‚Äôt make a pizza with or without cheese. And they are both burnt as well
Pizza Hut (705 George Street North),4,"For a quick meal on way home on a Friday? Can't beat a Triple Treat Box.  I say if you do the math, best deal for amount of food!  I love pan pizza!"
Burger King #2065 (750 Lansdowne Street West),1,"DO NOT waste your money on the whopper melts. This is how we got all 3 combos. Not toasted and it is just white bread. Do yourself a favour and stick to the original whopper in a bun.
Photo is posted of advertisement behind actual."
Burger King #2065 (750 Lansdowne Street West),4,"The food and the staff are great here. But the building is very old. Tables missing, some seats are wobbly. But I still eat there as I said the food is always good. And the staff always do their best."
Burger King #2065 (750 Lansdowne Street West),5,"Great staff and great service

We always dine in on Whopper Wednesdays and always enjoy our meals

We get take away other times each month to enjoy on a road trip out of town"
Burger King #2065 (750 Lansdowne Street West),5,BK has the best prices and food for a fast food restaurant.  Their staff is always friendly and they are hard workers.  It's nice to see management working along side of their staff.
Burger King #2065 (750 Lansdowne Street West),5,The food was fast and good. The decor not so good. Needs updating to have a cleaner experience.
Chicken Chicken (91 George Street North),2,"Good food BUT, they charge a nickel for a little paper bag that fit two subs. It's the principle of it and for some reason I think it's  a scam. Figure 100 customers per day at a nickel is $5. Then x that by 365 days a year. I just find that sneaky, especially after spending $25 on two subs."
Chicken Chicken (91 George Street North),5,"I dropped my wallet and the sandwich artist ‚ÄúJAGDEEP‚Äùwas kind enough who safely secured my wallet.

When I realized I dropped my wallet somewhere and I backtracked where JAGDEEP returned my wallet.

I really appreciate JAGDEEP for his help which I can never forget."
Chicken Chicken (91 George Street North),1,"Bad experience at this Subway, I ordered a foot long veggie delight guacamole and all veggies. The server was in a rush and forgetting to put it until reminded. Then he forgot to put the egg-less sauce - house and sweet onion. Felt like I was training the server."
Chicken Chicken (91 George Street North),5,"It is a Canadian Franchise & will always support such .
üëç's Up"
Chicken Chicken (91 George Street North),4,Typical Subway. Good sandwich.
"Pizza Pizza (91 George St, Peterborough)",1,"We've coming here foe quite some time and never an issue. But tonight, we ordered pickup as usual. Got all the way home, only to open both the pizza and half moon cheesey bread, both overcooked and burnt. Leaving half the pizza and all of the cheesy bread inedible.

The person working would've seen this, but they boxed it and served it up anyway without saying a word. We wouldn't have minded waiting more to have it made right. Such a dissapointment, this will be our last time going here."
"Pizza Pizza (91 George St, Peterborough)",3,"So both my wife and I used the bathroom there and they had no toilet paper. We went 30min apart of each other and we both had to let them know that there was no toilet paper. The customer service was poor and they were difficult communicating with us. They were not that busy so no excuses there. Then when we got home to eat, my panzo was not cooked all the way and was still doughy so I had to cook it myself. Although this is the first time we've had issue with the food, we nearly always have difficulty with communication there."
"Pizza Pizza (91 George St, Peterborough)",2,"Dirty tables, people tried to jump in front of me to order, they knew but tried to serve them first. I spoke up as I was with my child. Gave me a feeling that I was annoying them, no smiles, and I watched as they had friends come in, eat and get food then walk out and it looked like they didn't pay for the food..."
"Pizza Pizza (91 George St, Peterborough)",1,"Can I give zero stars? I suppose one star for the food. The service is poor - staff who smoke rarely wash their hands before preparing food (including the owner). On busy nights there are not enough staff to provide prompt service for walk-in customers (because owner will not bring in extra staff). Owner is also very cheap in other areas: constantly refuses to let customers use bathroom (one of which has had repeated seasonal water leaks from ceiling when air conditioning is running) often refuses to buy toilet paper for staff (the staff have to buy it at the Dollarama across the plaza). Constant issues with heat/air conditioning not working which makes working in the spring/summer near pizza ovens inhumane. Many other issues needing repair, including the eye-wash station which has been broken for over a year. Drivers are expected to run errands for the owner, whether it is banking or getting groceries the owner forgot to order from the main depot - this often includes getting cheese from other pizza competitors(!) just to have enough to get through the evening shift's orders. Panzorattis made for sale in front display are scantly filled with toppings. Slices for sale are often left for 4-5 hrs before being thrown out. Portion sizes shrink as prices go up. Staff are paid below minimum wage, including the cooks who rarely get any tips from walk-in sales. All employees paid in cash to make it easier for owner to lie on his income tax. New management taking over May 2023 could actually be worse, as they pay employees as little as 8 dollars an hour. Will have to see if repairs are done to bring store up to basic safety and atmosphere. Eat here at your own risk..."
"Pizza Pizza (91 George St, Peterborough)",3,"It was very overpriced with a lack of quality. Delivered by SKIP.  Arrived Cold. Ordered a small, and when they say small, it is no bigger than a personal size pizza.  For the first time ever, I could actually taste the cardboard box in the pizza.

As advised by the owner, I did contact Pizza Pizza via email provided.  A month give or take later, guess what?  No response.  The only thing I received was a computer generated acknowledgment that my email had been received.   Extremely poor customer service.  I have also noticed many complaints posted.  The owner responds with almost the exact same email I received from him.  I guess nobody can or will take responsibility.  I vote for Domino's fyi, much better tasting, and does provide good customer service."
Pizza Nova (908 Landsdowne St W),1,"The gluten free multi grain crust is not it. If you‚Äôre looking for a cracker with mediocre topping taste, this might be the place for you. Food was prepared without gloves, knowledge of the menu items and what ingredients they contain was lacking (to be fair, staff did call a manager to confirm ingredients on one of the pizzas). NOT A CELIAC SAFE ESTABLISHMENT"
Pizza Nova (908 Landsdowne St W),5,"I‚Äôve always loved Pizza Nova best, not just for the sauce (which is drool worthy) or that so many of them aren‚Äôt outfitted to look like you‚Äôre buying conveyor-belt pizza, but because the service is always STELLAR. I‚Äôve never had a bad pizza from Pizza Nova, but it‚Äôs not just about the pizza. Yesterday at the Lansdowne location in Peterborough, I‚Äôd just come from the vet with my cat, and their employee walked my pizza to the car. The staff are just so pleasant, not ‚ÄúI hate my job, how long till I can escape‚Äù like I see at so many other places."
Pizza Nova (908 Landsdowne St W),5,"Goodbye Hot and Not Fresh, Goodbye Over Priced Papa, Goodbye Triangle Domino..Hello to Pizza Nova! I have been a customer here and there over the years, but now I am here to stay. Better ingredients, better crust, better employees!

Yep, the pizza can take longer, yep a little more money than the other cardboard disc, but in my opinion, worth the wait!

And, any establishment that have staff that are having fun in front of customers, they will ensure you are happy with your order as they like their job and the people they work with! That translates into a good pie!
Be back next week!"
Pizza Nova (908 Landsdowne St W),5,They always make my pizza well done just the way I like it.  Awesome garlic bread as well.  Top notch pizza!
Pizza Nova (908 Landsdowne St W),1,"Ordered the other night. Took a long time past the time it said it would be ready. We had to call customer service 3 times. Each time being told it ""was 5 minutes away"" but wasn't  We had company over waiting to eat. The dairy free cheese was horrid and we ended up tossing the whole pizza out. It was like slime. We also didn't get the cookies we were supposed to get with our order so they credited it but i guess we lose out because we are never ordering here again"
241 Pizza  (140 Parkhill Rd W),1,"Ordered double sausage and it was so sparce, ordered bbq chicken pizza as well  with bbq sauce base and it came with pizza sauce base  and no bbq sauce at all.  Customer service representative was a joke, she said it was made with pizza sauce base since that's how they do it with a barbecue drizzle on top which was not there or how I ordered it specifically.. They said I could drive it back...  But we live 15 minutes away so that's great and not happening with three kids. We just ate pizza that was not what we wanted or what the kids enjoyed..   Will Order domino's next time....  It's cheaper and they are way more generous with toppings and customer service is better."
241 Pizza  (140 Parkhill Rd W),4,"Cheap pizza, decent quality and price. No seating inside but we took it out anyway. 2 topping XL was around $18"
241 Pizza  (140 Parkhill Rd W),1,"I ordered a pizza it was arriving late I waited almost another 20 minutes path The delivery time I picked up the phone to call them as I walk past the door the driver left the pizza in the snow no knock no phone call no nothing. Then when I call 2 for 1 pizza a lady spoke to me extremely rude,, overspoke me ,,wouldn't agree to help me the least little bit and I was utterly speechless that she was talking to me and didn't understand that leaving a hot pizza out in the cold snow made sense? As I realized this lady didn't understand what I was saying I stopped arguing the service here is terrible do not eat here And the delivery driver you should know to ring the freaking bell or knock on the door or phone... And say your food is arrived you better get it before it's a frozen  pizza....and its was arriving late I waited almost another 20 minutes past The delivery time I picked up the phone to call them as I walk past the door the driver left the pizza in the snow no knock no phone call no nothing."
241 Pizza  (140 Parkhill Rd W),1,"Came to the neighborhood to have the best poutine in Peterborough(sophies kitchen), but alas, it was closed. So came here n tried out a pizza and poutine, both of which turned out to be the worst i had in my entire lifetime thanks to 241 Pizza. Everything from the vegetables to the pizza base and the sauce was the worst (stale)üòÇüíî"
241 Pizza  (140 Parkhill Rd W),3,"I really don't usually leave a review, but since I know many check them I would like to help save someone from the same mistakes I made by going here.
1st, I should have checked the pizzas. 2nd, I should have reviewed it.
We were shopping from out of town, and decided to stop here on the way home. It seemed to have a steady customer flow, and the owner was super nice.
We were expecting good pizza, however; we were sorely surprised. I ordered the twin large with extra cheese on one. It was overcooked, and there was so little cheese you could see most of the dough, and sauce. The pizza dough through the cheese was even toasted.
The crust itself was really good, and probably would have been a fantastic pizza had some care gone into it.
Unfortunately we will not be returning to find out again.
Blessings, and good luck ‚úåÔ∏è"
Harvey's (Water St),5,"Went to this Harvey's for lunch, it was 10:30am and the service was excellent, they placed my order and had it ready in less then 5 minutes. The guy who made our burgers was like a burger ninja. Just kept firing at him what we wanted on our burger and he didn't miss a beat. Honestly compared to the other Harvey's in town this one is by far the best to go to."
Harvey's (Water St),1,"I bought a chocolate shake and they charged me 50 cents extra for chocolate sauce - the extra charge was not on the menu, and they didn‚Äôt tell me they were charging me extra, so I consider it stealing. It‚Äôs only fifty cents, but it‚Äôs the principle of it. And the shake was gluey and much too sweet. Disgusting all around. I won‚Äôt be going back."
Harvey's (Water St),1,"Previously i had 5 stars for this store. But last time i did collect my pick up order from drive through and they were so impatient. Lady on the mic just kept shouting from inside that what‚Äôs your number, look at your phone screen and tell your number. And at the time of collecting the order, the lady was like ‚Äúkeep your number ready or we won‚Äôt give order and you‚Äôll have to leave‚Äù. Have been in the town for many years, Never had such a rude, impolite and abusive behaviour anywhere in Peterborough."
Harvey's (Water St),2,"Ordered a crispy chicken sandwich. Tastes like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. Asked for pickles on the side, never got them. Very stingy with the sauce on the sandwich. Fries were warm."
Harvey's (Water St),2,"Always very slow service through the drive-thru. Went there tonight, with a smaller line-up. The worker had apologized for the wait once she finally addressed me. It was whatever until I got home to realize they had messed up my order. They had given us a different type of poutine, which had tasted really bad. Waste of time and a waste of a drive. Unsure if I will be going back."
Popeyes Louisana Kitchen (828 Chemong Road),5,Finally got to try this location. Seems good to me. Staff were very friendly and accommodating when I wanted to change my order after placing it. It was relatively clean and organized. Didn‚Äôt do the drive they but it wasn‚Äôt busy at all. Convenient hours; open late which is hard to find in Peterborough. My chicken sandwich had a massive piece of chicken in it which was fantastic and thoroughly cooked.
Popeyes Louisana Kitchen (828 Chemong Road),1,"This is unacceptable. When you're cooking raw chicken, make sure it's cooked I'm waiting in emerge right now no I didn't see maggots or anything. It wasn't until I checked my sandwich before I work.. there's no excuses. Hire people that are paid enough to take pride in making sure the chicken is cooked. And have someone inspect. Serving half cooked chicken is unacceptable they're already getting people sick. Their prices are astounding! 4 burgers and 4 sauces they charge for, with delivery and tip cost 53.81. and no there was no sides with itm the least would be to cook the cj thoroughly"
Popeyes Louisana Kitchen (828 Chemong Road),1,"If I could put 0 stars I would. After paying $54 for my family of 6 to eat Popeyes chicken we ate everything was great. Came home, put our left over food in the fridge right away. Husband took it to work today to eat the left overs for lunch. There was several maggots inside the chicken ü§¢ü§Æ I will never eat at any Popeyes ever again neither will my family this is disgusting"
Popeyes Louisana Kitchen (828 Chemong Road),1,"Went to this location Saturday May 20th at night, ordered chicken nuggets and got food poisoning that has lasted me a whole week!! Please handle your chicken more safely. I haven‚Äôt been so sick in years."
Popeyes Louisana Kitchen (828 Chemong Road),1,"Came on Monday May 22 @ 12:15am got a spicy chicken sandwich. Next day had food poisoning. Was throwing up, diarrhea, chills didn't get out of bed all day. Missed an over time work shift because of this. Thanks Popeyes handle and cook your chicken better"
Smitty's Family Restaurant (Peterborough),3,"$30 for 4 slices of bacon and eggs Benedict. A bit overpriced, the presentation looks nice, taste was bland/okay. Service was great, friendly staff."
Smitty's Family Restaurant (Peterborough),5,"My wife and I were visiting Peterborough and she was looking for a place to eat. She mentioned Smitty's, and I thought, 'I haven't seen a Smitty's around where we live in a long time. We decided to try it. I had the Cobb Salad. It was excellent. There was only one server on, but it was between lunch and supper so it was not very busy. He did an excellent job waiting on the customers who were there, and we never felt neglected. He is to be commended for his excellent service. I would recommend this restaurant. If we are ever back in the area we would likely go there again."
Smitty's Family Restaurant (Peterborough),5,Fabulous cinnamon swirl pancakes and omelettes. Kelly was an amazing waitress with over 40 years experience. Being from North Carolina I had not discovered ketchup chips and the owner gave me a bag to try. Yes! I‚Äôm hooked on Smittys and ketchup chips. Thank y‚Äôall for treating me like family.
Smitty's Family Restaurant (Peterborough),5,"My wife and I visited this morning. Had a great experience. Cinnamon roll pancakes are to die for (10 stars). Great service and Had a great talk with the owner.  Hi Todd,  We will see you again soon. Sharon & Cory"
Smitty's Family Restaurant (Peterborough),5,"Had a really good breakfast today.
Excellent service.  Great server. Ordered food which arrived quickly and they were busy!  Had eggs over easy, French toast with bacon!"
Allen Gourmet Coffee & Eatery,5,"Fantastic!! Went for brunch with family. It was great. Delicious food, friendly and helpful service, and so many pictures to look at!!! Will definitely be going back."
Allen Gourmet Coffee & Eatery,5,"Can be a little loud but that's to be expected when you visit a bar with great music and solid conversations happening. One of the best spots in town for a casual drink with friends - great atmosphere. The bartenders are just great- always looking out for you and super friendly! Havent tried much from the menu but both times I've gotten a sandwich at lunch its been surprisingly flavourful and inexpensive. Day or night, you've gotta check out the only cafe/bar!"
Allen Gourmet Coffee & Eatery,5,The food was delicious and the atmosphere was great. I was there with some friends and their kids. Everyone had a good time. I had Jeremy‚Äôs Grilled Jerk Turkey sandwich and it was just spicy enough to get my nose running but the heat was well moderated by the fresh tomato and lettuce. The pickles were wonderfully garlicky. My friends had vegan sandwiches that looked very tasty.
Allen Gourmet Coffee & Eatery,1,"The old guy with the buzz cut and glasses is extremely rude. He had an attitude for no reason. Went in there to try breakfast and the place was empty  and quiet and the guy ignored me when I said good morning. So I wasn't sure if they opened yet so I asked and he ignored me so I asked again and he said ""is the door open?"" and rolled his eyes. Felt so uncomfortable and awkward so we left without ordering and went to Cork and Bean instead where they actually have manners. I ate here before and had no issues, so maybe it was just that staff member."
Allen Gourmet Coffee & Eatery,1,Full of over served children screaming all night the AGCO needs to fine the servers and owners $50000 a peice people are regularly found passed out nearby and need to be taken by ambulance not to mention fire code violations like having more people drinking thare than they have space inside to keep them all
Maple moose pub,4,"The food was super tasty and served hot! Big portions as well. Service was a bit slow but some newer kitchen staff and a bridal shower to boot! Good atmosphere, not too loud and decent music in the background. Only real downside was the chairs....very, very uncomfortable. We would definitely recommend this pub."
Maple moose pub,5,"Great food and atmosphere. Waitress could have come over to check on us more as it wasn‚Äôt busy but the food was quick, delicious, and fresh. We were there for lunch. Pulled pork poutine, chicken Thai wrap.
Included the receipt with the daily specials."
Maple moose pub,5,"Great PUB to chill out with friends and family.üòé

Great offers and parties on weekend's.
The staff us really good and the bartender is really polite and humble. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèª

They serve all kinds of drinks and cocktails.üç∑üçπüçª

U  just need to ask for them and they have it.
Good ambience and good music. üé∂

The events are really nicely hosted by the management.üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë

Cleaned environment and nice furniture for sitting.

Cool variety of snacks and much more. üçïüåÆü´îü•ô

A must try for everyone ‚ù§Ô∏èüëåüèª"
Maple moose pub,5,The service here is awesome food is amazing. I have never had an issue with the food always amazing. The servers are amazing as well specially Sky and Jay they are always smiling even when they are having a bad day. I would highly recommend this place
Maple moose pub,3,"Just left disappointed, the service was slow, we ordered the All Canadian burgers my burger was missing toppings. The gravy on my fries was lumpy with the scum off the top of gravy. Asked for salt and pepper, never got it. There seemed to be some tension between the wait staff( one was standing there looking pretty with her ride home), when she left, it seemed to dissipate. We choose here for dinner because every place else was busy, overall not a good dining experience"
Brickhouse Grill and Bar (123 Simcoe St),4,"The food overall was tasty besides my child's nachos cheese not being melted and the garlic mashed potatoes lacked garlic.
There was a missing item. The missing item had special instructions as well. My husband and I had planned to share so it wasn't that big of a deal but still worth mentioning.
By looking at recent reviews, I can see the response from owner is a lot of excuses and no changes."
Brickhouse Grill and Bar (123 Simcoe St),2,"We decided to give this location 1 more chance. On our last visit items ordered were not very good.
So this time we ordered only burgers; our thinking was even if they are bad, how bad could they be?  Dry and over cooked!
We left most of our food on our plates.  We tried.  But will not be going back."
Brickhouse Grill and Bar (123 Simcoe St),1,"First visit a few months ago was without issue and everything was great. Second visit, was very dissapointing. We waited 1 hour, and no food. We saw multiple dilivery orders being served to delivery drivers waiting in the bar area. We made sure to tell the waitress, this is no fault of hers. This is all on the owner. The owner is the one who decides food delivery drivers and apps get priority over their in restaurant customers. We just asked for the bill for our drinks and left, as we would've missed our movie otherwise. The waitress was super good and comped our drinks though."
Brickhouse Grill and Bar (123 Simcoe St),1,Our appetizer of only mozza sticks was either not placed or forgotten. Like a blame game between the kitchen and server. After we asked it still took atleast 10 or more minutes to get them. Then the wrong food was brought to our table. Luckily it was just for the table beside us not our order wrong. But then when our order came. They forgot it was poutine instead of fries. The fish tasted weird. Should have read reviews first.
Brickhouse Grill and Bar (123 Simcoe St),2,"Meh. Not really a fan. Wings we ordered from here were soggy and unpleasant to eat. Had a burger another time and it was not bad, but not fantastic either. Then most recently I ordered the poutine and it was soooo small, at an entree price?! The gravy was thick and coagulated too. It was not a good poutine by any means lol"
Wendy's (1124 Chemong Road),1,"Orders are only correct once out of every ten visits. Management has no idea how to issue refunds and tells you to call corporate. With six active staff members and literally zero customers in the store or drive thru, this team took 17 minutes to fill an order for two hamburgers. When you do get the food, it's cold, and it's not what you ordered. Corporate would have fired my whole team if we ran our restaurant this way."
Wendy's (1124 Chemong Road),1,"MY ADVICE IS AVOID THIS WENDY'S LOCATION!!!
If I had the option of leaving a zero star review, I most definitely would be!!!
Decided to take my daughter out for dinner this evening around 4:30pm to the Wendy's that is located off Chemong Road in Peterborough.
My daughter had chicken nuggets & fries. I had a double original with cheese & a poutine. After having a few bites of my burger, I noticed that the patties were still pink! Even when the burger was cut in half it was incredibly pink inside!!
When the issue was brought up to the employees at the counter they proceed to mumble some excuse about adding extra patties, that made absolutely no sense whatsoever & proceed to make me another burger. The replacement burger was absolutely no better! It was overcooked & dry!!
By this point, I'm incredibly unsatisfied with our dining experience, I inform the employee at the cash that my replacement burger was disgusting & I no longer care for them to attempt to make me a new burger that I just want a refund & I will no longer be eating at this Wendy's location (not that the employees care).
I honestly couldn't be more disappointed with the way our dinner went. Hopefully I don't end up sick this evening with salmonella."
Wendy's (1124 Chemong Road),3,Well the order and pickup lines are apprently seperate but kind of pooly marked. I at first went to the wrong spot. I put my order in then stood in the pickup line every single person opened thier bag to see what was missing no mistakes that I noticed but it does make you wonder how often their is.
Wendy's (1124 Chemong Road),1,"Every table in the restaurant was dirty. My wife had to ask for a towel to clean a table. The employee came out and cleaned one table for us.
Garbages in the front and behind counter were extremely disgusting.
We were the only people in the restaurant at the time and witnessed all the employees having a great time but couldn‚Äôt understand a thing they were saying as there was not a single white employee.
Cleaning was not on their agenda!
I have lived in Peterborough my entire life and I frequently eat at this location.
Today though I felt like I was in a different country .
I am not being racist, so I am sorry if that‚Äôs what it sounds like but I do have pictures."
Wendy's (1124 Chemong Road),1,So Chemong Wendy's seems to have the same level of quality as Lansdowne Street location when it comes to messing up their orders and the food being horrible quality. My girlfriend tried calling the store but just got voicemail.  Now we are having to go back out and spend more money for food because what we recieved isn't even worth eating. Thats now 2 Wendy's locations we will avoid in the future. I seriously do not recommend Chemong or Lansdowne locations.
WING HOUSE,5,"This place is killer!! Awesome sauces with a ton of flavour! And the staff are awesome! Especially Tristan he's a chill dude and deserves a promotion!
Oh and the fries fluffy, golden, crispy and delicious!!
10/10 would recommend"
WING HOUSE,5,"Can‚Äôt say enough great things about this place. Our server Deanna was amazing with us and our young daughter! Very friendly and polite, fast service.. food was hot and the wings were saucy and crispy and flavour packed!!! The sauces were amazing to choose from! Price was fair, and portions were large. If you are looking for an amazing wing experience, make sure you stop in and grab some wings !!! Well done staff!!"
WING HOUSE,5,We came here for my daughter birthday and we were treated so well. Even with two minor under age of 5 the severs went over and beyond to make sure we had a great experience.  The food is phenomenal and the wings are one of the best in PTBO. If you are up for the heat challenge try the nelli fries üî• it's spicy. We ordered the original nachos the garlic parm wings and Mexican fries. All 10/10. Please visit for a great wings and drinks experience.
WING HOUSE,5,We went to this restaurant as a night out. The food was amazing particularly the wings. The service was top tier with respectfulness. Will definitely recommend and will go again.
WING HOUSE,5,We had dinner at the Wing House tonight for the first time and it was delicious! Our waitress Deanna was awesome.. So nice! We will be returning.
Wild Wing - Peterborough Downtown,4,Pretty solid food. The wings tasted great and had lots of sauce on it. The service was fast and friendly and welcoming all at once. They have a lot of space in the bar in the back for extra large groups as well
Wild Wing - Peterborough Downtown,1,"It was totally empty when we arrived and still took over an hour to get our food orders taken. The bar was out of a ton of drinks but couldn't tell us which.

Food was okay when we got it but service overall was poor the only reason we didn't leave was due crowds everywhere else but obviously they knew what we didnt"
Wild Wing - Peterborough Downtown,5,"I've eaten here before and it was good, but I'm leaving a review because I just called them and they were insanely friendly and nice. Never left a review just for that, but hey why not acknowledge the good vibes?"
Wild Wing - Peterborough Downtown,5,"Took the family there for New Years dinner. Great food, service. We were regular wild wing visitors 2 years ago at a different location and we got turned off. We will be back to this location. My adult son was even impressed."
Wild Wing - Peterborough Downtown,1,"I give it one because it was clean and our waitress was good. Otherwise, we each ordered single wings dinner ( I substituted rings for fries) and one coke.
$42 + not including tip!!...I got 8 of the smallest wings I've ever seen, and 6 rings, 3 of which were too small to mention. We'll never go back. So disappointing!"
One Eyed Jack Peterborough,4,"Food is always great, love the wings. Drinks are well made, $3 extra can get you a double in any cocktail. Waitstaff are on top of things and there‚Äôs rarely (if ever) a wait to get a table. This place is popular for very large groups so it gets super loud. My partner and I were having to yell across our small table just to hear each other by 6:15. Other than the noise, atmosphere is fine, and everything is clean, especially the bathrooms."
One Eyed Jack Peterborough,4,"Inside is quite dark and very loud,  but I expected it so prepared myself for the pub-style atmosphere. We didn't sit on the patio, but I walked out just to look. It was much quieter but just as busy. Quite a spacious patio set up. The service was very friendly, very fast and observant. We brought home a lot of leftovers as the portion sizes were rather large.
Very tasty!"
One Eyed Jack Peterborough,4,"Great pub style food. Service was great.

We were served by two different staff and both were great.

Our table was beside the end of the bar and a person at the bar kept falling asleep.  Staff had to keep waking him up. The staff knew the person by name, so the person seemed to be a regular. At first, it was kind of funny,  but we got concerned for the person's safety and concern that if they fell from their chair, they would hit our table.

I've been back a couple of times, had had a great experience."
One Eyed Jack Peterborough,5,"Kaitlin our server was fantastic. 3rd time here and still great food .
Ribs and wings special.
Back again for the fantastic food, chicken Fajitas,burgers and the stuffed potato skins.
Our server Hannah was fantastic üëè"
One Eyed Jack Peterborough,5,The food is amazing and is big portions! They are kind and courteous staff and the prices are great too! You get what you pay for!
Nakhraa (George St),5,"Absolutely amazing! Great service, and great food! Also, very pretty inside!"
Nakhraa (George St),1,"Lamb is cheap ground lamb, and was still uncooked in the masala. Garlic Naan was uncooked, sticky and had no flavour. Aloo Gobhi was mushy and tasted overly of tomatoes. Whole meal was absolute garbage. Missing mango lassis, although Im almost glad now. Don't even have contact to resolve issues (wonder why). Do not recommend. Same as Chaska."
Nakhraa (George St),5,"Absolutely delicious!! My roommates and I all love it, my one roommate is vegetarian and loves the Chana masala, and my other roommate and I love the Aloo gobi and butter chicken!

The staff are so kind and the restaurant is so nice!!"
Nakhraa (George St),1,They gave a different item without my knowledge
Nakhraa (George St),1,Totally useless food. . Garbage food.  Never eat here . Wastage of money
Alba Pizzeria,4,"Great tasting decently priced pizza. The sauce and cheese ratio was on point, the crust was amazing and toppings were fresh and high quality.

The only two things I would detract from Alba is location (being inside Peterborough Square) and lack of toppings."
Alba Pizzeria,5,"very nice pizza and I HATE pizza!!!!! unlike other pizza places, the crust on the bottom is thin and it makes the texture a lot nicer!! also the brownies are BANGING although a bit soft, ALSO the pizza guy is very polite and cool!!!"
Alba Pizzeria,4,"First time we ordered and had delivered.  Pizza was very good.  The wings were not crispy as expected,  but very flavourful!  I'd order again!"
Alba Pizzeria,2,"I ordered a slice of overpriced Hawaiian pizza. Sauce was bland, crust was brunt and ashy and dry. Toppings tasted fine. Honestly I‚Äôm not sure how they have 4 stars right now.
Also I saw a review claiming it was the best pizza in the mall - guess what it‚Äôs the only pizza!"
Alba Pizzeria,5,"One of my favourite pizza places in town. I prefer a thin crust pizza, so I love that their pizza is pretty thin."
McDonald's (Willowcreek),1,"Absolutely brutal. Everytime we go the order is wrong. Today we ordered a 10 piece McNugget meal through drive through - opened bag and saw 6 piece box. No big deal short a few nuggets we thought. Got home to eat and there was an egg and pieces of bacon in the 6 piece nugget box. Absolutely brutal, every time we go to this one our order is messed up."
McDonald's (Willowcreek),3,"It's not a bad place to stop at for a McDonald's. Usually fairly quick. Accuracy for orders is usually not that decent. Ask for no tomatoes on something or extra, and the packaging will be labeled as what you asked. 8 times out of 10, it will be incorrect."
McDonald's (Willowcreek),5,Very good food! Nice workers and lovely place to sit down for a bit. Drive through is a long wait but I‚Äôm fine with that!!
McDonald's (Willowcreek),3,Late June 2023 weekend noon. Very busy and the staff are working furiously. My mobile order was placed at the lowest priority even if it was in early in the list resulting more than 10 min late for a breakfast muffin. Seating space is limited and cramped. Better go with other McD down the Lansdowne next round.
McDonald's (Willowcreek),1,"From waiting 35 minutes for food after placing an order, to picking up from drive thru and finding half of our order missing. This location continues to disappoint. I understand mistakes happen, but repeatedly is unacceptable. Missing food, when it costs $30 for 2 people to eat fast food is ridiculous. I'm so disappointed."
Oasis Mediterranean Grill (OMG),4,"A good place for grab something quick. Chicken Shawarma platter is recommended. Taste and portion wise are both okay. Salad base has lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and some others. Both salad and chicken are at average level. The restaurant is designed for takeout, so utensils are all one-use type."
Oasis Mediterranean Grill (OMG),5,Freshly made to order. Very friendly and courteous staff. Clean atmosphere. Would come back.
Oasis Mediterranean Grill (OMG),5,"I went here for the first time yesterday and picked up a chicken shawarma. This was by far the BEST shawarma I have EVER had! The store was very clean, well kept and all of the ingredients looked nice and fresh! The staff were very friendly. I would highly recommend trying this place out! Five stars in my books! I can't wait to go back!!!!! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
Oasis Mediterranean Grill (OMG),5,This place always makes me happy. The food is so yummy and is the best when it comes to good service and super friendly staff. I have been more than once and it never fails to impress. My boyfriend raves about it as well and we are excited to be back when we come to Peterborough again.
Oasis Mediterranean Grill (OMG),5,"I always order here on Skip.
The food is so delicious, the flavours and ingredients are carefully chosen. The samosas are the best around. A little greasy but seriously delicious. I love the shawarma on the garden salad, I really enjoy the pickled veggies they put in there. So different. Never disappointed!
Thank you!"
East Side Mario's (Peterborough),5,"My boyfriend and I had a great experience here! Sam was our waiter and was extremely prompt and had a great personality. Drinks never got empty, salads and soups were delicious and as soon as we finished he was quick to ask what we wanted next. Bread was hot and always on the table. Got our orders correct. It was super busy at the restaurant so we really appreciate the amazing service! 10/10 recommend!"
East Side Mario's (Peterborough),3,"Stopped in for an early dinner with my baby and was very happy with how fast the service was. The servers were very quick and kind, and the food came out fast as well. My pasta is exactly what I expected, a bit plain tasting, but still yummy. The main reason this review is only three stars is because my meal cost $20 before tax, and this is the garden salad I got with it. There were 4 burger slice tomatoes, 2 whole rings of onion, one whole hot pepper, and two whole olives.  When I let the server know she offered to get me a new one, but I declined, then a cook came out of the kitchen, I assume, to look at me after the complaint. I suppose ""garden salad"" doesn't necessarily have a standard for ingredients, but as a  cook, I wouldn't give that away for free, never mind charging someone for it. My daughter did like the tomatoes, tho so at least the salad didn't go all to waste"
East Side Mario's (Peterborough),1,"My main issue here was the uncleanliness of the restaurant and dishes. Our cups and plates were covered in a gross film, and there was dried lettuce stuck to my plate. Even the walls had greasy fingerprints all over them. Additionally, our server was not very friendly. I told my partner that she could try some of my soup, and the waiter went on this whole rude tangent about how we can‚Äôt share meals. It was odd, as i never asked for an extra plate and we were all clearly ordering our own dishes. ?? The waiter seemed annoyed that i asked to use my scene card. (his name might have been dave?). he asked me to read out the numbers to him, before interrupting me and trying to grab my phone to put the numbers in himself.
For the mediocre food, poor service and filthy cups and plates, a $75 bill for three people was quite pricey. Definitely do NOT recommend this location."
East Side Mario's (Peterborough),5,"Fantastic food. Our server though was on the run steady. If they were to have more servers, the waiting  time would be faster. I felt sorry for her. She was attentive and bubbly with us. I was once in her shoes, and I didn't envy her today."
East Side Mario's (Peterborough),5,"I had an excellent time at East Side. Mario's, thanks to a really pleasant employee whose name I believe was Grace. She provided prompt and courteous service while working as a bartender. Drinks were nicely crafted, and effort was evident. When my wife and I sat at the bar, she always made sure we were taken care of and felt welcome. Grace, I'm grateful. ~ Henry"
Swiss Chalet (Goodfellow Rd & Lansdowne Ave W),5,"Was there today for a day trip, used to go there as a kid a lot and it was nice to have great service, great food.  I know sometimes the locations are hit and miss but our portions were large, the server was friendly and informative about the special.
Was quite happy"
Swiss Chalet (Goodfellow Rd & Lansdowne Ave W),5,Food was delivered promptly and was delicious. Service was fantastic from both my server and the male host.
Swiss Chalet (Goodfellow Rd & Lansdowne Ave W),1,I can't even leave a star for I never received it. After placing my order on the my husband went to go pick up the food and waited in the lobby for 25mimas. A guy came out of the kitchen to deliver a curbside pickup and didn't even speak to the lobby of customers. This is not how you run a business. I called and cancelled our order and took our business somewhere else. I will not buy from this location again.
Swiss Chalet (Goodfellow Rd & Lansdowne Ave W),5,"Stopped on way home from vacation. Very busy location but our server Beverly was super efficient and a very pleasant server.
Every Swiss Chalet should have a Beverly. Thank you for making our day."
Swiss Chalet (Goodfellow Rd & Lansdowne Ave W),4,"Came a few weeks ago with family who were visiting from BC. Our server was great, and the host who had seated us was awesome. Food is the same as you expect from most Swiss Chalet locations, so its pretty good overall. Location was clean and well lit when we came. Id say its worth a stop in"
KFC (595 Lansdowne Avenue),1,Worst food ever. The chicken was so soggy. French fries was not good. Did not maintain KFC standards. We asked employees to give crispy chicken and they said they don‚Äôt do any crispy chicken anymore. Worst food experience
KFC (595 Lansdowne Avenue),1,"This has to be the worst fast food joint in Peterborough. Food was bland and soggy, building looks worn and unkept. None of the staff seem to care about anything yet the credit machine suggests a tip while they are only offering take out lol.

Dining room is currently ""closed for construction"" but they clearly just don't want to maintain the space.

Haven't been in years and do not plan on going back anytime soon."
KFC (595 Lansdowne Avenue),1,"I have never been so disappointed by a chain fast food place. Washrooms did not feel clean. Place had the feeling needed a renovation. Tiles in line very worn. Drink machine not working.  I ordered a drink and no ice put in it.  It wasn't cool it was warm. I requested ice. And some ice added I think 3 ice cubes. They were gone before 1"" of my drink was gone. And it was still not cold. The fries were not hot.   Overall a very bad experience at this KFC."
KFC (595 Lansdowne Avenue),1,"Jhanvi is rudest of all the staff I have ever encountered here. She does not acknowledge the fact that the customer did not order what she heard I ordered. I returned the original item and asked her to give me what I ordered. Yet again she starts arguing. This isn't where you come from. FOOD---- stale, slimy but touch chicken pieces in my chicken sandwich. They need food handlers course properly not like their Toefl and Ilet results that they bought back home and came here. Learn the customer service here in Canada. People are paying for their food here."
KFC (595 Lansdowne Avenue),1,"Used to love this place before, not anymore. Food quality has gone down, customer service is poor, KFC standards are not maintained at all. Hate to say, but not going to come back to this location at all."
Peterborough Desi Cuisine,5,"This was our first visit to the Curry Village. We have a lot to say, so here's a summary, for tl;dr purposes :).

Portion quantity: large
Food quality: simply outstanding
Authenticity: the menu is North Indian (the owners are from Bangladesh) but with hints from Tamil Nadu in the South as well. That makes it pretty authentic.
Ambience: very nice place and well presented
Staff friendliness: really nice people!

The bottom line: if you like Indian food, you just have to visit this place. You will not be disappointed. Next time we're in Peterborough, we'll go back to Curry Village again.
===
Now, down to business. If you really want to know more, read on.

We loved it thay they have a real tandoor oven, so their naan would not simply be pita bread or a supermarket product like many other Indian restaurants, and they could do real tandoori food.

We were offered a special dish (not on the menu) called Chicken Malai, so we ordered that. We also ordered their Lamb Madras, Tarka Dhal, Dum Aloo, two chappatis, one plain naan and some excellent mango chutney. I make Indian food at home twice a week, because it's difficult to find quality Indian food here in Eastern Canada after moving from Scotland in 2004, and I've been making Indian food for about sixty years. I normally do chappatis rather than rice, and they seem to be difficult to find in Indian resaurants here, so the Curry Village chappatis were definitely worth a look.

They were sheer perfection, much better than my own (pretty good) efforts, and the naan, lightly spread with ghee, was to die for. I think that these accompaniments are just as important for authenticity as the main dishes, and the Curry Village did not disappoint. Even their complimentary poppadum was great!

The Chicken Malai was just amazing. Not too spicy, with tandoori chicken finished with a rich sauce of onion, ghee and malai, with an impressive depth of flavour. Malai is long-cooked whole milk (I'm sure they make it in-house) and the taste and aroma is a bit like condensed milk, but not at all sweet and much more delicate. Spectacular!

The Lamb Madras had the spicy hit we crave from that dish, very substantial, with the heat tempered nicely by fresh lemon juice, making it a bit like a laid-back vindaloo. Very good indeed.

The Tarka Dhal was just right, the slighty nutty flavour of the masoor dhal cooked with cumin and garam masala, with some green coriander stirred in. Lots of protein, lots of flavour and very satisfying, which is what dhal is all about.

Dum Aloo is slow-cooked potato with favourings, where the potato cooks ""in its own juices,"" a bit like a baked potato does, but the spices and a little tomato transform the dish. The Curry Village version is cooked in a pressure cooker and maybe it could have been cooked a little longer, but it still tasted good.

We will definitely be back."
Peterborough Desi Cuisine,5,The food is delicious. The service is excellent and the prices are so reasonable - I specifically like the chickpeas salad .
Peterborough Desi Cuisine,5,"FIVE STARS ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èThis food is absolutely amazing, I one hundred percent recommend this food, if you want to find a great Indian restaurant then COME HERE! üòãüòãüòã
They also have great recommendations for food and there food tastes better than all the other Indian restaurants I‚Äôve ever been to. üòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã"
Peterborough Desi Cuisine,5,Nice food. Nice service. Mr. Muslim is a very kind person.
Peterborough Desi Cuisine,1,"Extremely disappointed. I think most of the reviews are fake. I ordered few dishes but didn't liked any of them. I felt that food was frozen. Especially chicken. We ordered sizzling tandoori chicken, dal tadka, samosa and naan. Surprisingly all the dishes were on the table in less than 10 minutes. Usually tandoori dishes takes long time to cook in tandoori oven. We ordered garlic naan but they were nothing like that. There was no garlic in it. Overall, poor service and food. This might be a popular restaurant 15 years ago but it's not good anymore. I will attach pictures of dishes i ordered along with the reviewjust to prove that it happened for real.

IT WAS NOT AUTHENTIC INDIAN FOOD"
Curry Mantra (Peterborough),1,"Never ever had a butter chicken like this before!!!ü•µ
Have tried some other indian restaurants in Peterbrough before but was never disappointed. This time thought to try food at Curry Mantra and placed doorsash order, I would say total waste of money. I would never ever eat from here again. There was nothing except  food color on the tandoori chicken and butter chicken was runny and bland .

Being an Indian I would really like to appreciate and support indian food and business but please try to understand someone may order food from you when they can‚Äôt cook but having something like this won‚Äôt help."
Curry Mantra (Peterborough),4,The owner is very funny and the staff are very kind. They took time to explain to us what everything was and were so helpful and patient. It's in the George street mall in a special corner lol. Everything looks so good and the smells oh my just mouthwatering. The food was awesome. It's a treat to go into town and be able to eat authentic Indian food. You need to try this diamond in the rough.
Curry Mantra (Peterborough),5,"I ordered the Masala fries and a small lunch mantra with lemon rice and masala chicken. It was absolutely perfect, and exactly what I was looking for. The rice and masala chicken tasted great, and were not harsh on my stomach or pallette, the portions were great for the price, and I wish I'd gotten the larger size to have some left overs for later, because I ended up eating it all in one sitting. The masala fries were fresh, and really well done, and the spice on them was just right, I asked for medium spice and it was just right, and had a really good tang to it. I munched on the fries on the go, and they tasted good having a few to occupy me while I worked at my desk. I appreciated the friendly service, and the place was very nice, well lit, and spacious, something I can definitely see brining my parents, and family to for a day out and to sit down and eat as well. A well kept space. I also wish I'd gotten a drink, cause it was a hot day when I went. Thank you for the lovely food, the service, and the delicious masala fries. Also the care to sustainability as the container to take food in was reusable. I appreciate the care and kindness that has gone into the restaurant, the food and service."
Curry Mantra (Peterborough),1,"Worst meal ever. Ordered Veg (with spinach) Curry and coconut rice for $12 at the Saturday market downtown today. Very watery, curdled, taste was horrible and rice was all disgusting. Took one fork full and and threw the whole thing in the garbage..very disappointing. With the economy as it is I always support local business, definitely will not order from Curry Mantra and will not recommend to anyone."
Curry Mantra (Peterborough),1,"The butter chicken was bland and tasteless. Chicken pieces were old and almost stale. Rice was also undercooked.

Eat at your own RISK!"
Osmow's (Water St),1,"We were nearby so decided to give this place a try but were super disappointed.

1. There were bones inside the shawerma meat
2. Meat was old and dry
3. Garlic sauce was a salad dressing
4. Mild hot sauce tastes like the hottest thing on earth and we are used to eating spicy food

Overall none of us, in a party of 4 adults 4 kids, were able to finish the food. Please improve your quality of food. Skip the hot sauce its hot as hell."
Osmow's (Water St),3,"A descent place to get a quick Shawarma.
For some reason it is not as good as the ones in Toronto. Their hot sauce is very hot. I have a high tolerance for heat, but I was surprised.
I would recommend the chicken Saj. The lamb was chewy.
Overall, not a bad hybrid Shawarma. Not traditional."
Osmow's (Water St),5,"This is my go-to restaurant for shawarma wraps. I always order online and the food comes quick, tasty, and fresh.

I love the beef, chicken, and lamb shawarmas. My best meal is the chicken sharwarma on fries (STIX) or rice (ROCKS)üòç. There is a ‚Äúhalf-and-half‚Äù which means you can have a plate of half fries and half rice with shawarma on top.

The Tahini and Osmows special sauces are so good. You can choose how spicy you want your meal to be. And you can customize too (add or remove veggies, extra sauce, extra meat, etc).

Recommend."
Osmow's (Water St),1,"Imagine the mind set you'd have to be in to think this was acceptable to serve someone. Makes one pretty concerned what else you consider acceptable in your kitchen. Besides the obvious ingredients that should have been pitched yesterday, the chicken is full of a variety of bone splitters. I feel like I'm being punished for ordering from you... Well message received, never again."
Osmow's (Water St),3,I mean their food quality is much much better in this branch as compared to other.But one downside is that their portion sizes are very small as compared other branches of osmow‚Äôs.I mean this branch don‚Äôt do it generously the sauces on the top which feel dry to eat the rocks(rice).
Casper,5,"Just ordered this place on skip. I got a shawarma and veal schnitzel. The portions were excellent, but so was the quality.

The shawarma was very good, and big size. The Veal schnitzel was also incredible. Their fries are also good and were still crispy despite being delivered here which was nice.

Very happy I gave this place a try and will certainly order again. I highly recommend the veal schnitzel. I also got a salad that was very good and tasted like quality ingredients."
Casper,5,"Update: Normally I go here for the veal, it's the best in town, but today I tried Tandoori Chicken.   It was amazingly spicy, and beautifully done.   Please see pictures.

I don't understand why people complain about this place - but from my experience, it's spotless clean, friendly staff.  Amazing food.   We tried the Veal Sandwich today (not on menu yet but can be ordered) and it was phenomenal.  Sorry I don't have pics, by the time I got it home I just wanted to eat it cause I could smell it from their location to my home.

What I can say is I could smell their place from the Candy shop nearby and it instantly gets to your gut.   When I went inside the atmosphere somewhat modern but not tacky I knew whomever ran this place has passion; watching them cook and prep, they care.   I can't wait to go back, thank you again for your hospitality; I hope others in the area and tourists see what a hidden gem this is.

PS. Will update review with pics next time I eat there, promise.  However pictures won't do it justice.  It's rare for me to review so highly.

Happy Holidays,

Cory"
Casper,3,"I'm sorry to say the food was a bit disappointing.  I ordered 2 shawarma wraps and a shawarma plate.  The chicken was dry and the wraps were missing flavour and overwhelmed by hummus.

Atmosphere inside the restaurant is akin to a diner.  There were boxes of supplies stacked behind the counter, little organization, and white wine sitting on a shelf facing the sun.

It looks like the new owner was trying to preserve some of the old restaurant, but it's not working.  A rebrand might be necessary.

Also, with all the certificates on the wall, it's difficult to tell if it's a restaurant or a doctors office."
Casper,1,"Food was not good. Shawarma chicken was dry and burnt, butter chicken tasted nothing like butter chicken. Rice was soggy. Styrofoam plate was somehow flimsy, and they forgot the salad dressing. Food was edible, but it is not the best taste or value you can get it town, by a long shot. This place should probably focus on one type of food instead of doing everything poorly."
Casper,5,"Ordered chicken poutine. Very good quantity, very delicious. Staff was also friendly"
Red Lobster  (870 LANSDOWNE STREET W.),5,"Today for lunch, my family went over to Peterborough where we went to Red Lobster! I had a strawberry lemonade with a Caesar salad to start followed by a biscuit and then for my main I had their shrimp and lobster tacos. Those were really good along with the salad and biscuit was good also."
Red Lobster  (870 LANSDOWNE STREET W.),3,"What could have been a horrible experience for some?
We just laughed at it.
From the meals being warm  to the steak not being cooked the way it was ordered the wrong drink
The waitress took care of everything.  You have to give them credit for what they put up with from some customers.
If you trust the place you eat at they will take care of you but you also need to take care of them
Everything was fixed and replaced with fresh
Was the best afternoon in a long time"
Red Lobster  (870 LANSDOWNE STREET W.),5,"Food and drinks were delivered to our table at a above average pace. My start tai shrimp was very tasty and the sauce went well with the chopped vegetable bed. Main course of crispy scallops, garlic shrimp and shrimp linguine were very good and delivered hot! The Smashed Apple Cranberry cocktail was fantastic with the food

Huge shout out to our server Riley who was very humorous and personable"
Red Lobster  (870 LANSDOWNE STREET W.),4,"It's been 10 years since I've been here,  service is just as great as it's ever been. Food seems to have lost a bit of flavor, wondering if they are now using town water to cook food as it sucks the flavor right out of things. Noticed that you get far less for way more money, 5 scallops and 6 coconut shrimp with a side for 30 bucks seems a bit much. It's lost its flare for me and you can find better places for less money. As I sat there I knew, sorry red lobster we had some good times but I won't be back any time soon. Try milestones as it's my new favorite."
Red Lobster  (870 LANSDOWNE STREET W.),5,"The staff are very nice and helpful. I rush to airport, they can cook our pasta within 5 minutes and the quality were very good."
WingsUp! (Peterborough),5,"We visited this location all the way from Oshawa to explore the fresh wings. OMG,  we will definitely drive back here for more.
This location just opened 6 days ago& and they are doing an amazing service. The teamwork & the fresh food. We just tried their wings & appetizers along with cauliflower bits.  You will never regret your visit.  Stop by here & enjoy the freshly made wings.
The owner is very friendly."
WingsUp! (Peterborough),3,"We‚Äôre looking for the best wings in Peterborough and hadn‚Äôt tried WingsUp yet.
First off, on the positive‚Ä¶
Nice meaty wings. Pleasant delivery person.

On the negative‚Ä¶
Medium and hot sauces are bbq based, not your typical buffalo or Peppered hot sauce.
French fries are Wedges and even when we selected the ‚Äúcrispy ‚Äú option, they were not that crisp. Maybe you like, wedges? Not me.
Gravy is a gravy sauce, not a true thick gravy.
Tortilla chips are not corn based. I don‚Äôt believe they mention that. They are tasty but I was looking for corn.
Veggies were okay but they slice super giant carrots which are known to be a lot tougher than smaller carrots.
Food quality is good but as a wing and fries
Lover, this didn‚Äôt scratch the itch.

Don‚Äôt let me sway you, give them a try and you be the judge."
WingsUp! (Peterborough),1,"The only positive I can say is the wings are a nice size. The flavour of the sauce is off, the breading is soggy, the wedges were not crispy, like I asked for and there was absolutely no seasoning at all on them. The wings taste identical to the frozen wings you can buy at the grocery store. They put the veggies in the same box as the wings and they ended up being very warm too."
WingsUp! (Peterborough),1,"Just ordered fries, gravy, and a bites and pickles deal. The chicken is so over cooked I can't even get a metal fork into it. It's completely dry. I have never had such horribly over cooked chicken anywhere. It's charcoal. The gravy is horrible, thin and zero flavor just brown water. Fries are nothing to write home about. Deep fried pickles are ok.
I wouldn't recommend it even if it was half the price. Very very disappointed with tax it was over $30 per person"
WingsUp! (Peterborough),2,"8 wings and 4 jalapeno poppers is $24 + tax, which is rather expensive for take out, but if you want a side of hot sauce, they charge $4.95 for a tiny plastic container that every other restaurant would give out for free with a meal priced like this.

can't believe I'm about to defend wild wing here, but their wings are the same quality but cheaper, with a drastically better selection of hot sauces, and they won't stick you with a $5 bill for adding a side sauce.

two of us had a meal and shared 1 drink and 1 side sauce, and our bill was $63 before tip."
A&W (Lansdowne St),4,"Best place to have your snacks , dinner, lunch. They provide the different kind of tasty burgers and the intresting fact is that the burgers are named as family relationships like mama , papa , uncle and many other relatives.
One of the best thing to eat is beyond meat burger it's a vegetarian burger but try at once, it's a little costly but taste is good."
A&W (Lansdowne St),2,"I love A and W Food. Unfortunately, this franchise seems to be family run by group that does not get the 50s buzz of the food and atmosphere. People behind the counter were on cell phones, and paid little attention to customers. Staff were also filling toppings in plastic cups taking up the whole front counter. Condiments were not filled up and the tables were dirty."
A&W (Lansdowne St),1,"Went late around 11:30pm and our order was made incorrectly, and the burger was stale and nearly inedible. We were given completely different burgers than what was ordered and dipping sauce was missing for the fries. Seems the worker was too busy chatting with his 4 friends outside behind the building didn't want to do his job or deal with customers. Terrible. Didn't go back to complain because we were on our way home."
A&W (Lansdowne St),1,"The dining experience at this location has definitely gone downhill in past couple years. The restaurant looks incredibly run down & filthy!
My Mother & I visited this restaurant for dinner. The restaurant was uncomfortably hot (comparable to a sauna). There were multiple tables that needed to be wiped off. We dined in because we wanted the ice cold mugs that you typically get when you dine in, but received warm root beer in a take out cup (didn't even have ice in the cup!). The food (Mozza burger) was mediocre. The burger was basically a bun, could hardly tell there was meat on it. It definitely used to be a lot better.
The employees basically just stood around not bothering to wipe down the dirty tables, or tidy up anything.
It was a disappointing experience & I would recommend visiting another restaurant."
A&W (Lansdowne St),1,"Got the wrong order in the drive though. Went inside to get it corrected and none of the workers could understand that I didn‚Äôt get the correct order and told me I was wrong. I had the reciept for my order but had the wrong bag, fairly simple. I ended up leaving without one of the combos that I paid for. Don‚Äôt go here."
Baskin Robbins (908 Lansdowne St. W.),1,"The gluten free multi grain crust is not it. If you‚Äôre looking for a cracker with mediocre topping taste, this might be the place for you. Food was prepared without gloves, knowledge of the menu items and what ingredients they contain was lacking (to be fair, staff did call a manager to confirm ingredients on one of the pizzas). NOT A CELIAC SAFE ESTABLISHMENT"
Baskin Robbins (908 Lansdowne St. W.),5,"I‚Äôve always loved Pizza Nova best, not just for the sauce (which is drool worthy) or that so many of them aren‚Äôt outfitted to look like you‚Äôre buying conveyor-belt pizza, but because the service is always STELLAR. I‚Äôve never had a bad pizza from Pizza Nova, but it‚Äôs not just about the pizza. Yesterday at the Lansdowne location in Peterborough, I‚Äôd just come from the vet with my cat, and their employee walked my pizza to the car. The staff are just so pleasant, not ‚ÄúI hate my job, how long till I can escape‚Äù like I see at so many other places."
Baskin Robbins (908 Lansdowne St. W.),5,"Goodbye Hot and Not Fresh, Goodbye Over Priced Papa, Goodbye Triangle Domino..Hello to Pizza Nova! I have been a customer here and there over the years, but now I am here to stay. Better ingredients, better crust, better employees!

Yep, the pizza can take longer, yep a little more money than the other cardboard disc, but in my opinion, worth the wait!

And, any establishment that have staff that are having fun in front of customers, they will ensure you are happy with your order as they like their job and the people they work with! That translates into a good pie!
Be back next week!"
Baskin Robbins (908 Lansdowne St. W.),5,They always make my pizza well done just the way I like it.  Awesome garlic bread as well.  Top notch pizza!
Baskin Robbins (908 Lansdowne St. W.),1,"Ordered the other night. Took a long time past the time it said it would be ready. We had to call customer service 3 times. Each time being told it ""was 5 minutes away"" but wasn't  We had company over waiting to eat. The dairy free cheese was horrid and we ended up tossing the whole pizza out. It was like slime. We also didn't get the cookies we were supposed to get with our order so they credited it but i guess we lose out because we are never ordering here again"
Chef Basel Cuisine,5,"Delicious food made with fresh ingredients, good portion sizes, priced well, friendly staff & atmosphere. I would Highly recommend eating here!"
Chef Basel Cuisine,5,"This little diamond in the rough suprised me on our long road trip. We needed to stop for lunch and the massive menu was daunting but we were pleasantly surprised by the massive platefuls and low prices. The steak wrap was so delicious I almost cried. I will definitely be recommending this little slice of heaven, and I will be back."
Chef Basel Cuisine,5,"Little diamond in the rough. Found them just a few months ago and was blown away. Have had several meals since then and all are unbelievable.
Notable favorites are the fish tacos (way bigger portion than an app, can be a whole meal) Philly steak sandwich, fish and chips and the pulled pork. Fries are great and the salad is wonderful with their homemade dressing.
Breakfast is good too"
Chef Basel Cuisine,5,"This place is truly unassuming. It was the best food ever! Our party got chicken parmesan, butter chicken, pad ti, a kids pizza (massive!) And kids chicken fingers. We were all extremely impressed with the service, prompt food and below average prices. The portions were also very large. We had a chef eating with us and they were through the roof happy with their butter chicken. I would recommend Chef Basel to anyone. Will be returning here on the regular."
Chef Basel Cuisine,4,"Attached to a gas station, very unassuming but the food & value can‚Äôt be beat!
Fish tacos (listed as appetizers) is huge & delicious; the club sandwich was made with real chicken breast, not processed chicken slices. Fries were hot & crispy, gravy was a bit too salty. Overall good, would recommend going!"
Hanoi House,5,"Good news - world class Vietnamese food is availible in Peterborough! I'm astounded by every aspect of this place; the decor was cool (lots of plants everywhere), the service was fast and friendly and the food. Sweet mother of flavour the food here was delectable, I'm drooling as I write this!

First, you're going to have a tough time picking one of the many tantalizing dishes from the menu. Since this was our first time the table tried the salad rolls (spring and veggie) and the spring rolls (two orders of pork). Both were exceptional, I really have to commend the peanut dip. My mom liked it so much she jacked half my serving (Happy Mothers Day?!) then spent the whole ride home talking about how good it was.

Main course was even better. I've tried a lot of vermicelli and this was one of my favourite bowls ever. Great ratio of noodles, veggies and protein. The beef was cooked perfectly, with a nice savoury middle and some crispier parts around the outside. I tried a bite of the pork belly and chicken, both similarly tasty. Tonnes of actual vermicelli too so it was very filling.

My wife had the veggie Pho (she added rare beef and a fried egg) and loved both the toppings and the broth. Her portion was so large she barely ate half of it!

Waitress was friendly, attentive and quick on the refills and food. If it isn't obvious by now, you gotta cancel your dinner plans and get you and everyone you know in here. Unbelievable how good this place is, I might even head back in for lunch tomorrow!"
Hanoi House,5,"First time here, can‚Äôt wait to come back and try more menu items. Had the Vietnamese fried rice and wonton soup, broth was delicious. I think it would be beneficial to add the dietary options(gluten free etc) to the hard copy menu, making it easier to order. Service was very good!"
Hanoi House,5,Food was delish. Service was great. A little cold in there but otherwise fabulous.
Hanoi House,5,"We loved this place. Their avocado smoothie is proper. Their fried spring rolls are crispy and delicious. We had serious difficulty choosing what to have, everything looked amazing. Bahn mi was delicious. Service was super friendly and the inside was well renovated and clean. Love it, definitely coming back for some pho."
Hanoi House,5,"Drove an hour and a half out to PTBO just for these great dishes. Worth the drive out! Food was fresh, delicious, and of quality. The soup broth was probably my favourite üòç. Definitely will go back for more!"
Tacheena Middle Eastern Cuisine,5,"One of the top 3 places for a bite in Peterborough, without a doubt. How did I just get a wrap and tacheena bowl for the same price as a Big Mac meal. Then I take a bite and the flavour, texture, and presentation are 100%. Unreal. Exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey; 3 Michelin."
Tacheena Middle Eastern Cuisine,5,"Ordered 2 chicken shawarma, both were delicious, made fresh, and were served hot. The owner is very friendly, and the drinks are reasonably priced. Water is $1, anywhere else water would cost $2 if not more. Enjoyed the food, the interaction, and the environment. Will definitely be back!! This is the place you want to be if you want a fresh, warm, and delicious meal."
Tacheena Middle Eastern Cuisine,5,"Had an amazing quick lunch at Tacheena! First time here, and will definitely return. Split the Falafel salad between two - was truly appetizing, made with care, and it was very fresh! Also had the baklava for dessert, had a very nice touch of spice (not sure which one, maybe coriander?)"
Tacheena Middle Eastern Cuisine,5,"The food is delicious! And So fresh! Friendly service.
The restaurant is very clean.
One of my favorite places to eat!
Definitely would recommend 10/10."
Tacheena Middle Eastern Cuisine,5,"Excellent kebabs, the chicken tikka is the best I've had. The meat was very tender from being marinated and had rich flavors. Growing up in Toronto I had a lot of middle eastern food and this is the only place in Peterborough that really scratches that itch for me."
BOBO TEA,5,"Very cool vibe. Excellent friendly & attentive service. Delicious food. Definitely planning on returning again when we're in town. We got cold salad rolls, spring rolls, Tum Yam soup and Pho Bo soup (the soup portions were huge)."
BOBO TEA,5,"We had made a reservation and got a great table by the window. We ordered Karma's appetizer platter. It had a little bit of everything. Very tasty. I ordered the Tibetan Beef as a main. It was very good with beef, potatoes, glass noodles, tomato, onions and a nice broth that went well with the rice. Just a hint of spice. A very enjoyable experience. The only complaint I have is the music. A track of what seemed like Bob Dylan on repeat. It was kind of annoying. But the food was excellent üëç."
BOBO TEA,2,Got the gluten free pad Thai and I‚Äôm not sure if they forgot the sauce or something but the entire meal was really bland and felt like something was missing. Probably wouldn‚Äôt come back here TBH
BOBO TEA,5,Delightful tasty food in a friendly place. Fresh whole ginger!
BOBO TEA,3,"Found ourselves in Peterborough on a breezy sunny Saturday. Walked the streets to Karma Cafe, which was recommended by one of the local shop owners Ordered pad thai and red curry. The pad thai was NOT traditional it was more like a korean noodle dish and would pass on this one. The red thai curry was excellent. Service was OK. Took a long time to get our food and there were only 3 tables. Others seated near by were eating the noodle soup. Maybe this is their sweet spot. We will try somewhere else next time."
Shoeless Joe's Sports Grill (Peterborough),1,"This place does NOT know how to make a Chicken Alfredo. Cherry Tomatoes, nor pesto go in Chicken Alfredo. The chicken is the smallest thinnest piece of chicken. Why is it not even cut up to go in my pasta and a huge gross pesto covered chunk on top? Looks like it's a frozen chicken patty. Barely any alfredo sauce, basically dry to eat.
Plus +$20 for a badly done alfredo. Yikes."
Shoeless Joe's Sports Grill (Peterborough),5,"Visiting Peterborough, sports tournament; recommended to us. Big new place, I counted 12+ modern screens, will put volume on for playoff games and such, friendly and conscientious staff, great manager. At times can get super busy with group reservations! Large patio for those nice weather days."
Shoeless Joe's Sports Grill (Peterborough),3,"The atmosphere was awesome! They had a trivia game going (Thursdays). I got there in the middle so he said I could play the next round but he forgot to give me the paper üò¢
The drinks were good!
The appetizers were good!
Our meals however were really bad, I couldn‚Äôt eat mine and ether could my other party. They did credit one meal.
I did leave hungry and sad."
Shoeless Joe's Sports Grill (Peterborough),4,"Delicious pulled pork burger, fries, and garlic parmesan fries. Professional and friendly staff as well. Only dissapointment easily the portion sizes. Especially when paying $5 to upgrade to lattice fries and only receiving a small basket, and leaving still a little hungry after a meal and dessert. A perfect score would be had if you got a little more bang for your buck."
Shoeless Joe's Sports Grill (Peterborough),4,"Wonderful big new space. Beautiful classy decor for sport fans. Tons of tv‚Äôs but not too loud. Ribs were the best I‚Äôve had in years. Nachos excellent. Dusted wings excellent.  Chicken tendies great. Cheesie fries marginal - too spicy, soggy and not hot enough. Salted caramel vanilla crunch cake exceptional. Service fab. We‚Äôll be back!"
Tora Sushi,4,"My friend and I went here tonight, and it was great! We loved the atmosphere as soon as we walked in. Nice decor and very clean! The service was interesting because we ordered our food through an iPad but we had to ask for our bills via the server at the end of our meal. I believe this restaurant would benefit from having a ""special instructions"" section when people place their orders, rather than flagging down a server to make adjustments or substitutions. The food was good. I'd recommend this place!"
Tora Sushi,4,"Went there on Sunday, 9 Jul 23 at around 5pm. Fresh sushi, they didn't skimp out on the filling. Some places use more rice than filling but this restaurant wasn't one of them. We ordered Orochyon Ramen, Shoyu Ramen and SM Combo A with a green dragon roll and salmon nigiri. Orochyon had a good kick of spice, but the Shoyu was a bit too salty for me. Portion sizes were ok, big wallop of bean sprouts on top of the noodles. One slice of protein for each as bowl, but that seems to be standard for most restaurants to have minimal meat with noodles. Good service."
Tora Sushi,5,"We heard about this place through a coworker and decided to order delivery.
We were very surprised with the price and quality of the sushi. It exceeded our expectations. Will definitely be ordering from here again."
Tora Sushi,5,"I thought I tried sushi before here in Peterborough until I found this place. Well, this is my spot now. Cozy and neat spot in the middle of downtown. The service was simply amazing, and the flavour deserves my full 5 stars. Not only will I be coming back but I do recommend it. The whole first time experience was lovely."
Tora Sushi,5,"We went for lunch and were highly satisfied with taste, quality and pricing of the food.
If you are searching for affordable quality and quantity in Asian cuisine, this is right place.
Also service was excellent with minor touches and clean space. I didn't feel they are trying to conserve but rather comfortable with entire dinning time.
Though I wish there was bit more variety to the soup, and not majorly pork base. If customizable using veg broth or chicken broth would be 5*.
I hope the owners continues to maintain the standard and price range to make it possible for everyone to appreciate the goodness in this lovely town."
Hockey Sushi,5,"The friendly and fast service, as well as the fresh ingredients used in every dish we ordered tonight made up for the bland atmosphere of the restaurant. It is quite pricey but it is on par with every other sushi restaurant within 100 kilometres. I was very impressed with the quality of the food. I‚Äôve read many bad reviews on here and honestly I don‚Äôt believe not one of them. We were served and attended to by 3 different servers, all of whom were friendly and welcoming. I love this place. Thank you Hockey Sushi for a great dining out experience. God Bless."
Hockey Sushi,5,"I came here with my family the other day, I want to start off by saying that I love the food here and the whole atmosphere. I love their beef tataki and torched sushi. Their service is also very good, all the workers are very nice and kind. The price for the whole meal was also very reasonable, and it was cheaper compared to all the other places I‚Äôve visited before. Overall, I really recommend coming here as it is quite hard to find a place that uses fresh ingredients and that is price friendly too. Would definitely come back again! :)"
Hockey Sushi,3,"Been coming here for more than a decade. The food has always been good.

Downside is it‚Äôs incredibly expensive compared to other local all-you-can-eat sushi joints and they will cut you off without saying a word (especially in a larger group) if they think you are eating too much."
Hockey Sushi,2,"Hand rolls had way too much tempera shavings in it and seaweed was soggy. Sesame chicken tasted like watered down ketchup, blah. Only thing good was the beef and or chicken soup. Do not recommend and it cost $83.00 for 3 people for lunch!"
Hockey Sushi,4,"The sushi was really good, with great portions and variety. The service was very prompt and the staff were very friendly. My only complaints are; the chairs were all ripped and tattered, and there was an old dirty fish tank right at the front door"
TOKYO SUSHI PETERBOROUGH,5,Excellent food. It looks exactly like this one on the menu's picture. I love this amazing food
TOKYO SUSHI PETERBOROUGH,5,Excellent online ordering service with delivery. Plus a discount if you order online. The quality and variety of rolls is fantastic. I have yet to try something I haven't liked from this menu. Good prices.
TOKYO SUSHI PETERBOROUGH,5,"Absolutely my favorite favorite sushi place.
Fresh, fresh fresh & Flavour always pops! Lovely passionate people & delivery is always timely, nice price. Thank you very much for My mom treat sushi dates to self."
TOKYO SUSHI PETERBOROUGH,5,Seriously good sushi! I usually get their triple maki set B and its a ton of great maki for a decent price. The side salad is clean and crisp and the miso soup is a rich warming addition to your meal. Everything tastes fresh and delicious! They have kept my sushi cravings satisfied through the first lockdown and now this one. Service with a smile you can tell that they really care about what they are serving.
TOKYO SUSHI PETERBOROUGH,5,"Hands down the best sushi place in Peterborough. They have great combos and give 10% off if you order online, through the restaurant. They have the best miso, I love the avocado wakame salad paired with the spicy salmon roll. Tokyo sushi is my go-to every time I‚Äôm craving it!"
El Camino's,5,"Fantastic place. Perhaps the best restaurant in Peterborough, period! Been coming here since I was 14 with my sisters. Its been 11 years now! The guy with the sunglasses is pretty cool when he has time to chat. I'll be grabbing my classic pulled pork burrito with everything on it this summer when I come back from North Carolina. Cheers friends. Highly recommend... its too bad they don't have the spinach wrap, sh** was bless"
El Camino's,5,"This place is hidden gem!! So glad I found it! Food was so fresh and heavenly delicious. I had chicken burrito and tacos it's a must try!

Also Shree (chef) is very friendly and polite"
El Camino's,5,"Who the hell been keeping this place a secret from me? Some of the best Mexican in Ontario is hiding right here in Peterborough? Can't explain my ignorance but I CAN explain how incredible this food is. Also, the Owner clapping back on the fake 1 star reviews is hilarious. Check those out.

Got the ground beef burrito and it was everything I wanted - fast, affordable, hot and filled-unto-bursting with flavour and profile. I even told the homies to triple my hot sauce application and they were happy to oblige. I like a simple burrito, so the picture reflects that. Would have doubled the size if I added what's availible.

Also, burrito and pop was like 11 dollars. Which is wild considering you can't walk down the street without spending twenty. I was actually so blown away by the value I tipped $5 without taking the first bite. The first bite was worth $10 so another hit of value as soon as I walked out of the store.

Stop wasting your time with chain burrito places. If you're in the mood for Mexican and not actually in Mexico, you gotta come here. I'd argue it's even worth the drive from the GTA.

See you soon El Camino's!"
El Camino's,5,"Awesome little place with great food.  Good if you have time to enjoy your food or if you‚Äôre busy/on the road and want real food instead of franchise garbage.  Food was ready quick.

Had a bean and cheese burrito with everything, but guacamole.  Was more than filling, but didn‚Äôt sit heavy.

Love the decoration, too."
El Camino's,5,"El Camino's has good quality ingredients and friendly service.

The ground beef burrito had a very distinct taste and the ingredients seemed to be quite fresh."
Snack Bar Saint-Jean,4,Good fast food. Burger was a sensible size and tasted different than your the usual fast food. We liked that. Poutine had crispy fries and delicious gravy. I‚Äôd come back here again for a quick snack if I‚Äôm in the area.
Snack Bar Saint-Jean,4,Good poutine joint with burger and other snack options. Very good location. Washroom is not that great. Cochonne poutine and Inter burger tastes great
Snack Bar Saint-Jean,5,"Always seemed to be busy here with people but they cook an amazing poutine so that's to be expected. Was in town for a short while and had luxury of being here multiple times. All the times fries were amazing. It would have been nice to have the cheese a little more melted and on one occasion the gravy wasn't as hot as it could be but I didn't say anything so can't really complain. This poutine with the peas and adding cheese was amazing. The Burgers were also good as well.

Edit: One thing I wanted to add was pretty sure the difference is they actually cook the fries twice."
Snack Bar Saint-Jean,5,"Nice little spot. Actually, it's bigger than it appears. Quick and friendly service. I would go again. Food came out fast and hot. No complaints."
Snack Bar Saint-Jean,5,The food here was alright. The portions are very large. The server was very nice.
Costco (440 Rue Bouvier),1,"The pizza at Costco is to be avoided! Just not edible, full of salt, just greasy dough, and I had to throw away 3/4 of it.
I have never eaten such horror.
I like Costco but not their pizza"
Costco (440 Rue Bouvier),5,Perfect for a quick and easy pizza dinner with the kids!
Costco (440 Rue Bouvier),5,"It has become a tradition in the long run, 1 slice of peperoni cheese pizza. Too bad you don't make All-Dress pizza."
Costco (440 Rue Bouvier),5,"A nice big Polish hot dog with a liquor for less than $2. Plus, you don't need to be a member to enjoy it. An excellent place for a quick, cheap and not too nutritious dinner! To try it is to adopt it!"
Costco (440 Rue Bouvier),5,
A&W (597 Boul Wilfrid-Hamel),1,"Terrible restaurant. We never order from them and something isn't missing. Today our Uber eats order arrived (again) with missing items. 2 kids menu, missing milk and the actual meat in the sandwich. And one adult combo. So we complained and ordered from McDonald's in front of them because they are less lousy.  When you walk in it is easy to understand why, Staff are all busy to speak in creole together and laugh than work....."
A&W (597 Boul Wilfrid-Hamel),4,"My vegan friend and I went to A & W at about 1 am. This branch is open until around 3 am, and as a midnight restaurant, the cleanness was adequate. Both driveway and restaurant were not crowded. The sandwiches were delicious (potatoes with skin are yummier and crispier than the regular ones), and nothing was missed. This fast food chain restaurant has a vegetarian/vegan option, a highly positive point of their restaurant. You can serve your ketchup with packets. The other impressive point was the mood and manner of the cashier and other staff. It should be mentioned that this restaurant has indoor and outdoor seats to sit and enjoy your meals in this pleasant summertime.
You can see their menu and prices in the other images.
The soft drink didn't have ice, which is a substantial drawback. I requested some cubes, but they stated they don't have any!

A&W (597 Boul Wilfrid-Hamel),4,"Good place for a quick eating. Lots of windowed seatings. Food hot, fresh veggies, burger as big as always (nice). Lots of parking space (more in the back). Service is decent. You can see they put effort but easily overwhelmed when busy especially with a rotating crew lately (i guess they‚Äôre also touched by lack of personnel). As every fast food joint, not great at ordering and pick up lines, is it on purpose? Drinks can be much but worth it. Not a fan of the paper straws since they don‚Äôt last much. A great stop but avoid lunch rush."
A&W (597 Boul Wilfrid-Hamel),5,"This A&W had a huge wait, many in line at the drive through and inside. The staff were working very hard. I only speak a little French, and the woman who took my order was very patient with me despite how much there was to do. I appreciated that so much. We got our meals and enjoyed very much. I hope management appreciates their team!"
A&W (597 Boul Wilfrid-Hamel),1,"Worst A&W ever. Ordered a few times on UberEats and DoorDash and they ALWAYS forget an entire burger or screw up a meal. Even went today to give it another chance and NOPE, missing burger and screwed up my brother‚Äôs burger entirely. Not impressed at all."
Subway (696 St-Vallier O.),1,"Don't bother going there, opening hours are arbitrary for them. Showed up half an hour before advertised closing time and it was closed. Bad business practices."
Subway (696 St-Vallier O.),4,They make fast and simple sandwiches. Nothing to write home about but still good.
Subway (696 St-Vallier O.),5,Super clean. Fast and talented service.
Subway (696 St-Vallier O.),5,Clean place tasty subs
Subway (696 St-Vallier O.),4,"Small place, early closing hours"
Le Subtil (Rue Grandjean),5,"Amazing place if you want to have a pleasant cafe experience.  Food is amazing, staff is very nice.  Will definitely come again."
Le Subtil (Rue Grandjean),5,Everithing it‚Äôs nice in le subtil I love this place
Le Subtil (Rue Grandjean),5,Excellent fast casual healthy food. Super refreshing after a day or two of air travel. Nice ambiance and friendly bilingual staff.
Le Subtil (Rue Grandjean),5,"Very good joint for healthier ""fast food"". Not that fast tough for you'll have to wait 5 to 10 minutes for your meal depending on what hour of the day you order. Place is very clean. Food tastes very good and is better quality and healthier than any fast food joint around town. Menu is a bit limited but I always found something which pleases my taste of the moment."
Le Subtil (Rue Grandjean),5,"One of the best places in the surroundings for good and fresh sandwich. With soup and or dessert, you get get a great meal at a regular price. You must try it!"
Fastoche Sandwicherie,4,Good selection of sandwiches and fresh salads. Various teas selection.  Some seats by the window front and throughout the food court. Reasonably priced
Fastoche Sandwicherie,4,"Sandwichs lack on quantity, are a bit pricy but are really tasty. Burgers fill you up good and are juicy. You sometimes have to wait though."
Fastoche Sandwicherie,4,Good burgers!
Fastoche Sandwicherie,3,I had a goat burger. The burger was okay but the goat cheese was kind of Boursin with no real flavor. The fries were McDonald's style matchstick fries and the salad was pretty basic. Quite a mixed experience in the end.
Fastoche Sandwicherie,5,"Excellent choice of sandwiches, salad, soup and small desserts or snacks:

It was my first visit and my choice was duck and blueberry baguette. It was delicious üëåüèª

Fast service and courteous employees!"
Pizz√©ria No.900 (Montcalm),4,"I placed a delivery order via Uber Eats of grilled pepperoncinis as a starter and two pizzas. I liked the starter, especially the bread provided. The dip was ok only and could have had more taste and creaminess. The pizzas tasted very good! The size could have been a bit bigger. But I definitely would order with them again in the future!"
Pizz√©ria No.900 (Montcalm),5,"Amazing experience. Creative menu , fast and welcoming service. Will be back next time in Qc city ."
Pizz√©ria No.900 (Montcalm),5,"Good ingredients, dough made in the classic Napolitan style with the classic Italian wood oven. Impeccable quality/price. The classic black and white decoration makes it perfect for a weekly diner or a Saturday date with a couple of good things to drink. The spot on Cartier's street side makes it perfect reach a lot of other great places in the Old Qu√©bec."
Pizz√©ria No.900 (Montcalm),2,"We have ordered 2 pizza Margaritas and Porcini, honestly speaking I didn‚Äôt like the taste much, although not sure if my taste buds are different from French taste. Although, I prefer Porcini over Margarita.

The staff was friendly."
Pizz√©ria No.900 (Montcalm),4,"We order the aperitivo, was really small and nothing special. The pizzas were tasty, a good size for one person. The service was slow but friendly."
St-Hubert (Grande All√©e Est),5,"I wasn't planning to eat here after reading that it's a Chicken Restaurant, but after exploring other options, we ended up here, and it ended up being our favorite restaurant in town. They don't serve only chicken. We ended up ordering the ribs and chicken with Indian spices, then ended up going back another day for the lobster rolls, which were also delicious, but really small for the price.

I was just confused, because the restaurant had both dining and take out and there is a separate section for the take-out. Communication was a bit difficult, as the main guy who greets and seats you, and runs the takeout, only speaks French. But he was extremely helpful and patient, and with my very limited French and his very limited English, we some how managed to communicate our needs and order to each other. My only complaint is that the service was very slow. They seemed short staffed.

Menu is a bit small, but I would definitely recommend this place in Quebec City, especially if you're craving lobster rolls."
St-Hubert (Grande All√©e Est),5,I cannot go to Quebec without eating here. I love St Hubert this location was spectacular with great staff. Super clean place with the best rotesiarre chicken in the world. The coleslaw is beyond good.
St-Hubert (Grande All√©e Est),5,"St-Hubert is a great restaurant to visit after touring La Citadelle de Qu√©bec. I highly recommend the Piri-piri roasted double chicken leg, which is incredibly flavorful and juicy. The service at St-Hubert was also very good, and the outdoor dining area is a great place to enjoy a meal on a nice day. I would definitely recommend St-Hubert to anyone visiting Quebec City."
St-Hubert (Grande All√©e Est),5,"I came for a solo dinner, was greeted and seated by the waitress nicely. Interacted with 3 staff and they were all welcoming and professional. The food was hot and delicious, the pi√±a colada was amazing. I had a great time, the atmosphere was wonderful!"
St-Hubert (Grande All√©e Est),2,"Had the chance to experience this St. Hubert here in Quebec City...we tried their half chicken and fish and chips. Presentation was nice. Service was amazing! Food taste fine and really was on the salty side...the fish, chocken and gravy...so eating every single item seemed hard to swallow. Other than the salt rush...it would have been really amazing!"
Thaizone (Sainte-Foy),5,"""This branch only"" is recommended so far for thaizone. Normal thaizone menu but more fresh and better quality. Food/service/atmosphere are as expected for franchise, but better than other all asian food franchise(and better than some of actual asian restaurants-shame).  Recommend to visit there to eat than delivery. They make food fresh
Noodle menu/general tao/wonton soup I have been tried."
Thaizone (Sainte-Foy),4,"I got general tao chicken with a side of wonton soup to go. The general tao was out of this world, it tastes fresh, the chicken was super tender, no complaints. The wonton soup was not up to my standard unfortunately, it tasted like something I could buy frozen at the supermarket. There was a small mix-up with my order (I didn‚Äôt get my drink) but taking into account it was rush hour, I can look past that small inconvenience. I am definitely going back to try other dishes!"
Thaizone (Sainte-Foy),5,Best thai food I ever had. Fresh and yummy food.
Thaizone (Sainte-Foy),5,"This restaurant served the best Pad Thai I've ever had. Lots of veggies, tangy sauce, noodles that weren't doughy. Wonderful!
Their English was good too."
Thaizone (Sainte-Foy),2,"Ordered a general tao chicken with a wonton soup to go and that's what I saw when opened the lid... I love Thaizone, but I was really disappointed."
Boston Pizza (Ste-Foy),5,"We went on June 3rd with a large group around 930pm.  We were seated right away and served by a young gentlemen (I am so sorry I forgot his name).  Our service was perfect, food was served promptly and we just had a great time in the environment.  Highly recommended!"
Boston Pizza (Ste-Foy),4,"Cool vibe during the week, closer to the weekend it definitely becomes much busier. The ‚Äúcollege girl‚Äù waitstaff tried their hardest to understand day english and accommodate my requests. Great dry rub wings, beer and tvs galore. If you‚Äôre lazy like me after a long day at work it was the perfect place to get food and enjoy the view and head back to my hotel room next door."
Boston Pizza (Ste-Foy),3,Pretty pricey for what it was and the pizza's weren't very interesting. But the staff was very nice! And the bar setting was nice too!
Boston Pizza (Ste-Foy),1,"The food is basically the same as every other Boston Pizza. The service is definitely slow, inefficient but friendly. The restaurant itself is not well maintained and dirty."
Boston Pizza (Ste-Foy),4,"we dine outside (patio) which was good, the staff & service was courteous. We had pizza, wings and dessert, i really like the dessert, pizza was not great..  overall it was good experience..!!"
Benny&Co. (Charlesbourg),5,"This was our first visit here...

Our server was very kind... And very helpful.."
Benny&Co. (Charlesbourg),5,Nice atmosphere and delicious food.

Benny&Co. (Charlesbourg),5,Top shape üòõ
Dattes et olives,3,"The food was amazing. But the service was not appreciated. The lady wanted us to order only from the few dishes she recommended. When asked for an extra plate to share food, the plate was almost thrown at our table. Dattes N olives, I would really recommend that you guys do better at your customer service.
I am pulling down my rating just because of your poor customer service."
Dattes et olives,4,"A Tunisian restaurant that serves halal foods. We tried Mediterranean dish (a mixture of chicken fillet, beef sausage and kefta) served with rice, fries and salad! It was good; however, the kefta was really dry!"
Dattes et olives,5,"Traditional Tunisian dishes, really good ones.tried almost everything and my top favourite one is the Tunisian plate(plat Tunisien) , generous quantity and freshly baked bread ü•ñ"
Dattes et olives,5,Portions are huge. Durra is an amazing host. With a big smile üòÄ
Dattes et olives,1,"We were on a trip in Quebec and wanted some tasty authentic middle east food to enjoy. So we stopped by at dattes and olives since it was really close by. But when we ordered the food it was horrible. They put a giant amount, but that giant amount was horrible. The meat was dry and hard burned and not edible at all. The rice was flavorless and some pieces weren't even fully cooked. The only decent part was the fries and sauce. Adding on when I went to the bathroom the WHOLE floor was covered in oil!
I nearly slipped. The floor was sticky. Hygiene wasn't close to enough. So if you want to eat there i do not recommend."
"Tim Horton's (589, Boul. Wilfrid-Hamel)",5,"Although this place is not very big in size, the service was very good. I am quite satisfied with the quality of bagels. The coffee was also good. The staffs were very polite."
"Tim Horton's (589, Boul. Wilfrid-Hamel)",1,More than 15 minutes for one coffee good job guys
"Tim Horton's (589, Boul. Wilfrid-Hamel)",4,It wasnt bad bud the french vanilla wasn't tasty to be honest they should improve on it
"Tim Horton's (589, Boul. Wilfrid-Hamel)",5,I am really feel lucky to go to that location during my visit to Quebec. They are professional and understand my needs. Went to them twice in 3 days. I was thinking i will get problem due to French language but they understand my English very well and gave me 100% great customer service and exact fresh order. Thank you guys
"Tim Horton's (589, Boul. Wilfrid-Hamel)",5,"Day or night, I‚Äôve always had an excellent service at the drive-thru. The staff is very sympathetic and the service is fast. I particularly appreciate that the food is fresh. Donuts are really moist, just perfect! And the drive-thru is open 24/7, while most restaurants around are closed on night."
R√¥tisserie Fus√©e (Loretteville),2,"Service is cold, dont know about the food but the experience on the phone did not make me want to order at that location.

Also why do during a pandemic they dont take reservation for pick-up on the phone. Not going to be waiting outside for my order to get ready and am certainly not waiting inside with other people..."
R√¥tisserie Fus√©e (Loretteville),4,Food is good. No service. Cashier not too happy.
R√¥tisserie Fus√©e (Loretteville),5,Great service. Good Chicken
R√¥tisserie Fus√©e (Loretteville),4,good size chicken breast for a reasonable price.
R√¥tisserie Fus√©e (Loretteville),3,Service at night is slow and cashier was very arrogant.
Pizza Pizza (1345 Chemin Ste. Foy),5,Excellent pizza for evening snack! Clean place and friendly staff! Thanks to make St-Sacrement a better place!
Pizza Pizza (1345 Chemin Ste. Foy),1,"According to my personal experience: before putting your cashiers into action, a work ethic training is highly recommanded... Now lets close with a positive feedback and emphasis that the food is wummy. Cheers"
Pizza Pizza (1345 Chemin Ste. Foy),5,"Friendly staff. My order was presented nicely with fresh veggies as topping & fresh grinned  cheese. It was delicious ,definitely coming back."
Pizza Pizza (1345 Chemin Ste. Foy),5,"GREAT FOOD, GREAT PRICES, AND GREAT DELIVERY.EXCELENT CuSTOMER SERVICE.OUR WHOLE FAMILY LOVES THEIR FOOD IS GREAT. DELIVERY IS ALWAYS QUICK . THANK YOU"
Pizza Pizza (1345 Chemin Ste. Foy),5,"Very fast service and maintains high level of hygiene. So far, the best place I have tried in Quebec city for taste."
Jumelles Pizza,1,"The single most terrible experience I ever had, went in to buy a pizza 20-30min before closure, the impolite terrible human greeted me with an upset face saying that they're closing in 20min and then proceeded to throw away the menu when I asked him about the specials. What made me more and more upset another group came in and he just exploded started cursing in Arabic. I understand it's a late night shift but you're lucky I let it slide you impolite human."
Jumelles Pizza,5,"If you want insanely good pizzas for a reasonable price this is the place
Whenever i order pizza here it always broke my expectations in terms of speed and taste.
A must if you pass thru!"
Jumelles Pizza,5,"One of the best places to eat in Qu√©bec, hands down. Reasonable prices, good food. I love going here."
Jumelles Pizza,5,"This place is a hidden gem, we googled and found them. The halal pizza and halal wings were yummy üòã. Be aware not everything is halal so you have to ask for halal options. Sometimes one of the servers doesn't speak English but thats ok because they have others who do. They deliver as well.

We ordered pizza with halal chicken, halal pepperoni, mushrooms, black olives and chilli. We got table service and the order came within 10mins.

Highly recommended!"
Jumelles Pizza,5,"Amazing place to eat at! Excellent tasting pizza and poutine, generous portions at a pretty decent price. The staff was friendly and super accommodating and made us feel really welcomed. Definitely recommend trying this place out."
Les R√¥tisseries Benny (840 rue Bouvier),4,"Excellent infrastructure! The restaurant is well built and decorated! Affordables prices, huge portions. They even gave me 2 chicken legs instead of 1 by mistake! Very good food only thing is that their mayo is expired and they charge you if you take more than 2 packs of mayo per person"
Les R√¥tisseries Benny (840 rue Bouvier),1,Worst place even forgot dessert in the order and say this is not they fault they don't have give any compansation
Les R√¥tisseries Benny (840 rue Bouvier),5,nice!
Les R√¥tisseries Benny (840 rue Bouvier),3,Service lent...
Les R√¥tisseries Benny (840 rue Bouvier),1,"Order after 1h45 waiting for delivery, frette and soft potato, I ordered an extra fries because he already put nothing in the standard potato order, the photo says it all"
Sushiman (Laurier),5,"The service is always 10/10 , they are always so so nice . The sushis are very good and not that expensive , it's a good place to go to lunch."
Sushiman (Laurier),4,"Nice lunch not expensive but only a few pieces of fish. Pretty good for the price, and all pre made on the premises. So, finally a sushi alternative for a quick lunch, and not in the food court."
Sushiman (Laurier),5,Great place for Sushi
Sushiman (Laurier),2,Good taste but expensive
Sushiman (Laurier),1,"The service was long. It was not edible, the salmon was soft/not fresh and had a funny color. The seaweed was way too hard and didn't taste good. Stomach aches followed this meal. Also, no value for money. I do not recommend !!!"
La Calebasse,5,"The restaurant doesn‚Äôt look like much but the food tells another story. We were 8 people and it took us about 30 minutes to get our food (worth the wait). I had the beef brochettes with rice (comes with plantain). Very tasty and well seasoned. Their juices are good too (I recommend the ginger). The young man working here was working very hard, serving and cooking! God bless this establishment abundantly. Will come back for sure."
La Calebasse,5,"I passed this place several times, but I have never been interested to try their food.

Finally, on a cold winter Sunday evening, I landed there to buy rice.
The smell of the food attracted me. I decided to get the fish plate. They had several interesting and exotic things on the menu.

The dish I ordered cost me around 16$, it was fish (grilled tilapia) served with ati√©k√©, plantain, and salad.
Everything was tasty, the way they grilled the fish is just like in my home country.

It is also served with sauce and a very tiny portion of hot chilli sauce. I'm a big fan of capsaicin, so I found this chilli is a big bonus.
The plantain was cooked very well, it was sweet and crispy at the same time. I can finish a box of plantain only.

Unfortunately, I'm not a big an of ati√©k√©, it tastes sour somehow, and it wasn't suitable with my palate.

At the end, I cooked the rice that I had bought earlier there. It was rice from Mali, the brand of the rice is Sada. It has special fragrance, the grains were slim and the rice is sticky.

I'm overall satisfied with my purchase.

In this place you can also find lots of African goods, cosmetics, fish, frozen meat like beef tripe, beef tail, etc."
La Calebasse,5,"I can not rave about this place enough! My family and I have been travelling around Quebec essentially on a food tour (including 2 food festivals in Montreal this past week) and after a week of travelling were feeling quite lazy and decided to Doordash dinner to our AirB&B. We had no specific type of meal in mind but this restaurant popped up on my Doordash homepage. We ordered from here on a whim and OMG it has been the best meal of our trip. Like, I'm pretty sure I will be on my death bed 60 years from now saying ""remember that amazing African food we had in Quebec City in 2022?"" If you have the opportunity to eat a meal from here -DO IT!"
La Calebasse,3,"The food is excellent but their customer services really sucks. I ordered 3 fishes for pick up. Gave then 1hr notice. I went there after making me wait for 20 minutes  and told me that it wasn't ready that they need an extra hour.
You need a lot of patience to eat there."
La Calebasse,4,"Place is pretty much neat and very homely. Food is great. Cooked from scratch. No microwave. But it takes up to 35 minutes to get your food. I don't know if their tradition, the guy just left the food on the counter for me to serve my group. The fruit drinks like mango, pineapple, berry and hibiscus taste fresh and delicious. You have to pick up your plates after eating. Overall, nice cosy place to eat a fresh East African cuisine."
Topla! Ste-Foy (Pyramide),5,"The pastas are cooked to perfection, with just the right amount of sauce and toppings. The dining area is nice and quiet which i appreciate considering how busy it gets at the Pyramide."
Topla! Ste-Foy (Pyramide),4,"Great salmon pastas, nice employees serving the food and great options. Do look at the pictures I took to decide if youd like some too"
Topla! Ste-Foy (Pyramide),5,Great place for pastas. There are decent amount of options and the food quality is great.  The staff is courteous and helpful. The restaurant is conveniently located at one side of the food court.
Topla! Ste-Foy (Pyramide),3,Just mediocre....
Topla! Ste-Foy (Pyramide),1,"First attempt: order arrived more than an hour after the proposed time frame. The pasta was very soft, the bread seemed good, but unfortunately: the whole thing very cold.

Second attempt: 2h40 after the delivery time and still nothing‚Ä¶ I am sincerely disappointed with this service. I do not recommend at all!"
Jugo Juice (Laurier),5,Top in city
Jugo Juice (Laurier),4,"Excellent service!
The juices are good, the only negative point is the impossibility of taking a small format for certain juices (protein for example).
I recommend the peanut/chocolate butter.
Prices are around $6 to $10, $11 with taxes for a large juice.
The straws are made of paper, it's rather difficult to drink üòÖ"
Jugo Juice (Laurier),4,"Really good smoothies that are a great alternative to the slushes that are too often given to kids, but I believe they would greatly expand their customer base by adding low sugar and Keto alternatives. This would allow diabetics to benefit from exceptional health products. It's time for everyone to discover the natural alternatives to sugar: erythritol and monk fruit."
Jugo Juice (Laurier),5,"Very good! Lots of healthy, sugar-free choices, and even protein! Very cool to have this at Place Laurier"
Jugo Juice (Laurier),1,"It's really excellent, we signed up for the loyalty program, but we never had a reward to realize that the rewards expire 8 days after having obtained them and it's been more than 3 that I have seen that expire in my account... It's annoying and it gives me a bad image of this business that I loved. You should drop your loyalty program rather than upset your loyal customers, it's not a great idea think about it."
Pizza Charest,4,"Decent pizza in a struggling shopping mall. It has an outside door behind the mall. So, you don't have to enter the mall to get to that place"
Pizza Charest,5,"Great service, good food, will be returning very soon with friends."
Pizza Charest,5,Pizza was amazing and nicely priced
Pizza Charest,4,"Excellent pizza at a very good price!
Deliveries are fast and service is courteous."
Pizza Charest,5,Je sais pas mais pour moi cette pizza est la meilleur au quebec 15 sur 10 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Marmiton Pizza (QUEBEC),1,"Unfortunately we received horrible service when ordering here this evening, after never receiving our 49$ order. Waiting to speak to manager."
Marmiton Pizza (QUEBEC),5,"Best pizza in town , very friendly staff !"
Marmiton Pizza (QUEBEC),5,"Good service, inexpensive and a pretty good buffet."
Marmiton Pizza (QUEBEC),5,"Great pizza, great price and great people!!"
Marmiton Pizza (QUEBEC),5,best pizza
Pizza Salvator√© (Ste Foy) (2),5,"Had a nice deal with a pizza they were trying to sell since an order got canceled, very accommodating. The food was very good. :) Will be trying their desert options next time."
Pizza Salvator√© (Ste Foy) (2),4,"I ordered for takeout and it was half-half pizza, spicy thai chicken and whisky BBQ sauce and beef, also the popcorn chicken pouting. The pizza taste was great. The popcorn chicken is ok but I think the porsion is small."
Pizza Salvator√© (Ste Foy) (2),4,i got the poutine from here and it was meh. the pizza is probably better. i will try it next time.
Pizza Salvator√© (Ste Foy) (2),4,"Party time chez Salvatore's. La gang de cuisine cr√©√© une ambiance festive pour le restaurant. Ce fut super agr√©able de manger tard le soir avec une excellente pizza. Mon exp√©rience a √©t√© positive.

Ouvert jusqu'√† 3:00 AM.

Reply to client service comment:

Hello to Victoria,
I wanted to clarify my review on Google maps. My experience was pleasant, not a bad one at all.

Sorry if it was interpreted as bad. I upgraded my stars to 4.

The guys offered fun and joyful service. There was good music and they were very friendly, they took our order rapidly and let us know the specials. It was refreshing to see people happy to work together in a friendly atmosphere. Don't reprimand them. Instead let them know we had a good meal with pleasant ambiance. Their choice of music was perfect!

Bon travail, nous allons y retourner. Surtout apr√®s 23:00."
Pizza Salvator√© (Ste Foy) (2),1,"Terrible , their advertising says they are open until 3h45! I ordered at 2h20 online.  On their schedule online it clearly said it was still open until 3h45, as shown in the advertisement which for me was great.  So I payed in advance as well.  They showed me that the order was being made and cooked.  When I re checked  , it says I cancelled my order successfully. So I decided  to call to see what was the problem .  Magically their schedule online changed to 2h45, so I called with no successful answer.  Am I getting a refund here or what‚Äôs going on?  If the employees didn‚Äôt want to make another order that‚Äôs fine, cancel it but at least have the courtesy to inform your customer what is going on.  Terrible customer service , and is this false advertisement?  Terrible terrible experience"
Freshii (47 Ren√©-L√©vesque),5,Very nice Mexican bowl food. Taste and quality was amazing.  The service was also good. Food quantity is very filling.  One of the best food to try in Quebec.
Freshii (47 Ren√©-L√©vesque),5,Good but dont take any freshii drinks
Freshii (47 Ren√©-L√©vesque),4,"The elements in the periodic table should not have two capital letters. e.g. ""ED"" ought to be ""Ed"" (see first attached picture).

The spoons are too small for the bowls (see second attached picture). My spoon kept falling into the soup: each time, the handle got wet.

Otherwise, the restaurant's layout and decor are lovely. The washrooms are beautiful."
Freshii (47 Ren√©-L√©vesque),4,"super costly. I ordered a customised burrito and a falafel bowl. I couldn't finish the burrito because of the the bland taste. however, falafel bowl was tasty. also, staff is very welcoming and polite."
Freshii (47 Ren√©-L√©vesque),5,"Forgot to take a picture of my food‚Äî got the Market wrap with falafel, and it disappeared so quickly! So nice to have a place with healthier choices! Great atmosphere inside and friendly people."
Pizza Ramos,5,"This pizza place is my all time favourite. It is quite easily the best pizza in Quebec city bar none. The Alfredo pizza and the vegetarian one are exquisite!

The ingredients are freshly bought daily and it shows in the taste. It's also a much more authentic Italian pizza experience, with their use of less greasy and heavy dough and what seems to be a genuine wood oven!

I cannot recommend this place enough! The owner was an absolute pleasure to talk to and was so welcoming and friendly. I can't wait to come back in person. Keep in mind this place also delivers and stay open until very late which is a godsend for night owls like myself.

Do yourself a favour and come taste it for yourselves. You won't regret it!"
Pizza Ramos,5,"I ordered 2 pizza at midnight,12 km away from the restaurant and the delivery was super quick (under 30 min 0_0) they blow my mind! the spicy chicken pizza was delicious and everything arrived hot including the fries. Unbelivable service! 10/10 Ramos pizza you guys Killing it! Thanks a bunch!"
Pizza Ramos,5,I went there with my husband and my daughter. I don't remember the name of the pizza we ordered but it had chicken and buffalo sauce I believe? It was really good! The place was clean. And the service was great. They even gave my daughter a little gift. Thank you! Hope your business thrives!
Pizza Ramos,5,Amazing vegetarian pizza and great veg poutine. A must have in Quebec City. And hats off for keeping it open even on New Year‚Äôs Eve. Very pleasant experience!
Pizza Ramos,5,Had a vegetarian pizza here and it was really tasty! Definitely gets my warmest recommendations üòä
Pizza Miam's,4,"The staff is very polite and welcoming which make a difference to your experience. They are motivated and dedicated, you can tell by their attention to details !
Also, the location is great, accessible with a lot of parking.

In terms of food, it was good but I don't see anything special about it. It's decent compare to the other halal options in Quebec city.

Overall, I will rate this place as a 3.5. Yet, I will give it a 4.5 for being a great one compare to other halal places"
Pizza Miam's,4,"Their menu is very creative and it was new for me. I ordered Makloub(chicken) and baguette farcie (chicken). The taste were so delicious and I really like it.
The service is poor and the price is higher than the other fast foods but the food are fresh and delicious."
Pizza Miam's,1,"I just got a medium $20 poutine with cold fries üò≥
The sauce and beef meat are so salty that it hurts to eat them. And yeah, the lady there doesn‚Äôt have any customer service skills. She was talking on the phone while I was in front of her waiting for her to finish so I could ask her for napkins.. honestly had good expectations.. üòï"
Pizza Miam's,1,"The lady was horrible and rude I wanted to purchase pizza dough to make pizza with my kids at home. She said she didn‚Äôt sell any and didn‚Äôt know where. I found some at the shop next door and came back to tell her she said she didn‚Äôt want to know. I was really offended to see how she was so egocentric and ignorant of our culture of sharing and helping. Really disappointing, I don‚Äôt see how I could encourage such a business."
Pizza Miam's,5,"Nice little place, the lady was amazing and nice! My food was tasty, the price well worth it!! Thank you, I‚Äôll definitely come back."
Sushi X (Cartier),5,Clearly the best Quality/Price üç£ you can get in Quebec city. The Cartier 's Sushi X is particularly small and the atmosphere feels more like a diner place. Not the best for a date but definitely the place if you want something good and affordable. Drinks are O.K too. DO NOT MISS THE THA√è SOUPE.
Sushi X (Cartier),5,"I really like the place. You can choose between sitting indoor or outdoor. The staffs were really nice. They explained the menu to you clearly if you ask some menu that you don't know. My friends and I ordered the non-alcoholic cocktail. You need to ask them for this option. I tried the cucumber and tonic. Really refreshing. And we ordered fried calamari for the appetizer. Recommended! And the last, XX plate. I really impressed with the pizza sushi! I really like it!"
Sushi X (Cartier),1,"Please guys, if you are like me and you want to come here due to the amazing reviews, it‚Äôs not worth it. After having dinner, I was wondering why on earth this place was so highly rated. It turns out they give a free dessert if you leave a goggle review. There was an ad on each table explaining this. We chose the all you can eat menu. This was the most limited all you can eat I‚Äôve ever been to. They charge extras for many essential things. The AYCE menu items are so limited and some things are plain inedible. Popcorn shrimp was cold and disgusting. General Tao tasted rubbery and was 2 pieces with mostly rice. Sushis all tasted the same and looked badly made. A lot of raw ginger in the food which I don‚Äôt like. THE SERVICE SUCKED. The waitresses don‚Äôt smile, they don‚Äôt want to work, they look like they‚Äôre being forced to work, they leave the food waiting a while before grabbing it, they take many breaks‚Ä¶ We went there on a Saturday at 7:30 thinking it would be jam packed due to the reviews‚Ä¶ The place was empty only 2 other couples were there‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure everyone leaves a good review for the free desert and then never step foot back in. On the upside our sangria was good. 150$ bill for 2 people was really ridiculous for the food we had‚Ä¶"
Sushi X (Cartier),5,Real authentic Japanese style restaurant. I can say it is the best sushi I ever tasted in Canada. The smoked salmon Maki is unforgettable. Flavour is perfect and fascinating. Recommended everyone who want to try sushi for the first time! It will give you a marvellous experience.
Sushi X (Cartier),5,"Would 100% recommend it to everyone. The atmosphere, table setup and all the decorations were neat and gorgeous. The service was extremely quick and kind. The food  presentation was absolutely eye catching and the food was a delicious mouth watering work of art. Would 100% recommend if you want to experience a cozy environment with your family while eating japanese cousine."
Shogun Sushi,3,"Pleasantly surprised by the service and understanding, I thank the staff and owner however the food did not convince us. People seem to like it but definitely not for us. The sushi¬†is way too big for an all you can eat. 5 pieces and you‚Äôre full‚Ä¶ The salmon though tasty was not prepared to correct standards, 4 bones and a scale for 6 pieces of sashimi."
Shogun Sushi,1,"We came in, and no one let us know that it was an all you can eat buffet or ala-carte. We were very confused by the ordering process. They never brought ginger or Wasabi until we asked. No one ever came for a drink order. The food was mediocre. Honestly, it's the worst restaurant we have ever been to."
Shogun Sushi,4,"Good Japanese buffet style restaurant. The options are ok. I like the way they use iPad for ordering. No need to wait for the server to take your orders.

We were there for a dinner. The Sashimi was surprisingly good and fresh. We tried them all. However, many orders were gone missing. So, we have to re-order again.

The restaurant is part of the hotel. The parking lot in front of the restaurant is limited and always full. But you can find parking spots close-by."
Shogun Sushi,4,My husband and I were craving sushi and found this gem. We decided to do the chef's special with a bunch of courses. It was a crazy amount of food and an amazing price. The downfall was that it was BYOB and we didn‚Äôt know. Also the rolls were so huge that you needed mode than 1 bite. I would have liked to have smaller rolls or sashimi as well. It was all huge rolls. Overall solid sushi and great date night!
Shogun Sushi,1,"Ordered a take out. Paid for a sea tood rice and received plain rice mixed with a few broccoli, three or four pieces of a very small shrimp and some very hard inedible calamari. No taste, no salt. Sushi was also terrible. Awful experience. I will never order from
This place ever again"
Bi√®res et Frites (Ste-Foy),2,"Edit 07/03/23. Service and food quality drasticly changed lately, i used to go once a week but I'm going less and less often  due to unapetizing food ans stomach pain. Nowadays the service is ok nothing great.

The service was amazing, the place was filled when i got there and i got my order in 4 min , i even got a smile with it! The poutine was very good , even better with that low price from the tuesday deals. I would have liked some canned Microbrewry beer to buy one with my order, just so I could be totally in the fries and beer concept but I'm still coming back for more great poutine! A"
Bi√®res et Frites (Ste-Foy),5,Very cheap beer and poutine. Spicy poutine was tasty with a kick to it. Recommend the spicy poutine if you like a bit of spicyness in your food.
Bi√®res et Frites (Ste-Foy),5,I was impressed üëå. The service was wonderful and polite. Would recommend giving this place a pop-in when in the area.
Bi√®res et Frites (Ste-Foy),5,Best Poutine - Cheapest Price - Large Quantity - Easy 5/5 ‚ù§Ô∏è
Bi√®res et Frites (Ste-Foy),1,"Was in Quebec City for work about a week or 2 ago. Cashier had limited patience speaking English, even though she clearly knew how to speak it. Ended up finding a staple in my poutine, can only assume they don‚Äôt like anglophones. Beware if you‚Äôre out of province"
La Cage (Ancienne-Lorette),5,First time there. Had the steak. Done to perfection. Meal tasted great.
La Cage (Ancienne-Lorette),1,"Showed up with my family after a long road trip to the city in the evening 7:35pm.
We were told no places available if no reservation was made.  Clearly, we were able to see a multitude of tables for 4 empty, and there was room for them to take on more business.
I don't recommend such establishments when they don't respect walk in clients.
To say there were no seats....and it was full,I would understand....but nit this
I went elsewhere and I spend more.  To bad for them"
La Cage (Ancienne-Lorette),5,Nice place. Food was great. Lots of TVs on various channels. Very popular so there was a short wait to get in. I especially appreciate it that our waitress spoke English.
La Cage (Ancienne-Lorette),1,"If you have any allergies forget this location. I‚Äôve been here 3 times, I‚Äôm allergic to pork and every time I‚Äôve asked for no bacon (an easy request). Every time I‚Äôve received something with bacon which is definitely a kitchen problem at this point."
La Cage (Ancienne-Lorette),4,"Pretty good sports restaurant, lots of screens to watch many sports channels. Great ambiance.

The food was good, hot and decent size plates."
Cin√©ma Cineplex IMAX aux Galeries de la Capitale,1,"Worst experience ever. The people who work in there shouldn't be able to served, they are so horrible, they always have something to say like (ca va prendre plus de 20 minutes pour etre prete ou je suis disponible pour le faire apres de certain heure) its like a FAVOR. I always took them because is the only sushi restaurant that Galeries de la capitale have, but I swear! Never order anything again there."
Cin√©ma Cineplex IMAX aux Galeries de la Capitale,1,"Awful.... if you can pick anything else, do.

The ramen was a joke, 11$ for bland, tasteless and undercooked.

If you want ramen, get the 50c ones from Walmart, a million times better."
Cin√©ma Cineplex IMAX aux Galeries de la Capitale,1,"Extraordinarily bad. Ramen soup using warm broth, leaving the noodles undercooked and floury. Textureless chicken pieces, half a boiled egg and a couple of bean sprouts rounded off an awful meal."
Cin√©ma Cineplex IMAX aux Galeries de la Capitale,3,It was fun except the 1000 kids there because of spring break. The staff was disorganized as they were under staffed.
Cin√©ma Cineplex IMAX aux Galeries de la Capitale,5,Ok
Thai Express (Couronne),5,I stopped by right when they were just opening up for the day. I was not sure at first as the menu was in French but the friendly staff were kind to explain the menu and how to order. I had the tofu pad se ew and it was cooked fresh right after I ordered. The taste and size portion were decent good for the price and given it was more of an express/fast food place than a sit down proper restaurant. They also had free peanuts mini packages and lime slices on the side.
Thai Express (Couronne),3,"Food is bad. I wouldn‚Äôt try again. The good thing is that they prepare the food right after orders are placed, so the food is hot when served. Other than that, I can‚Äôt think of any positive thing to say about this chain eatery."
Thai Express (Couronne),1,"Worst food. The cashier was nice but the food was not. The mango salad in their menu pics versus what you get is poles apart. Tried this chain for the first time, won‚Äôt return."
Thai Express (Couronne),2,"It was my first time ordering this kind of food. And I guess the last time‚Ä¶
I ordered fried rice with mushrooms and beef, and fried dumplings. Beef was very hard to chew and the rice tested so bad, like someone burnt eggs or vegetables when they cooked it and after added it to the rice. And you can taste these burnt ingredients. Disgusting. Also no salt or pepper.
The only positive moment is the size of the rice. It‚Äôs a very big bowl for 17-20$. But at the same time‚Ä¶ huge bowl of burnt rice.
Don‚Äôt order there. I‚Äôm very disappointed."
Thai Express (Couronne),5,Generous portion. Tasty. free rice if you needed more
La Galette Libanaise (St. Joseph),5,"Delicious Lebanese pita sandwiches. Hearty portion of toppings which are fully customizable. Tasty, seasoned chicken. Excellent value for what you get. Good place to stop in St Joseph."
La Galette Libanaise (St. Joseph),5,"The food was incredible!! Fresh baked bread with fresh meat, veggies and garlic sauce, delicious!! Owner checked in with our party and told us about the fire that closed the restaurant for months. So happy to support these hardworking owners."
La Galette Libanaise (St. Joseph),5,Fantastic pita sandwiches and extremely friendly and courteous staff.  Probably the most pleasant surprise restaurant of the entire 9 days in QC!
La Galette Libanaise (St. Joseph),5,Very pleased with this dining experience. The food is made fresh right in front of you. The wraps were delicious and definitely worth another visit. Recommended!
La Galette Libanaise (St. Joseph),4,The food here is delicious and so filling. The bread was fresh and warm and the baklava just melted into the mouth.
Kim boba,5,"Absolutely love this place! It's so nice to have a restaurant that is outside Quebec's culture of just burger and fries, one of the things I miss from montreal. The staff is very kind and friendly and the food is amazing. Great ph·ªü, great imperial rolls, and great boba! If you're ever around I highly recommend trying this place out."
Kim boba,4,Crispy rolls with great ginger fish sauce. Ginger schrimps was delicious! One of few places you can have Pho in Qu√©bec. Can't wait to try it!
Kim boba,5,"Soupe Pho  were tasty and
Rouleaux imp√©riaux were delicious!
We stopped by this restaurant during our trip.  We definitely want to go again if we have a chance to come nearby. C·∫£m ∆°n"
Kim boba,3,"Shrimp/chicken roll was bland and soggy, the sauce tasted very fishy. Just wasn't my kind of food."
Kim boba,5,Delicious Pho and yummy bubble tea. üòç
La Baraque √† Frites,5,Best poutine in Quebec! Old school diner vibe with exceptional service. Their reputation proceeds them with droves of locals and tourists stopping by to pick up orders to go.
La Baraque √† Frites,5,"If you're looking for that family feel ...Fast and delicious fried chicken
Fresh french fries...
Stop by and pick up or eat in ..
Our meals were absolutely delicious.."
La Baraque √† Frites,5,"This place is awesome for deep-fried chicken or French fries. So far the staff have been courteous, and the small setting is cozy.
French cheese and crispy fries make the difference..
Cheers"
La Baraque √† Frites,4,Crispy seasoned chicken thighs! Made hot and fresh in this small dinner looking place. Their sweet BBQ sauce is very unique and goes well with the chicken and fries. Very affordable and nice staff :)
La Baraque √† Frites,5,"The only fry chicken worth mentioning in town.

I  tried the chicken and the poutine last night.  While the exterior look might stop you, don't.  The look is deceiving. This is a small joint with a quick and passionate team that deliver the best fried chicken in Qu√©bec city.  Moist and very crunchy, texture feel like a panko mix. The sauce is a smoky ultra sweet genre, very close to the one we use to get at Swiss Chalet or some Ontario Mcdo.

The poutine was very good. One of the owner worked last night and suggested marinade onion to complete the experience and you must absolutely add them. The sauce is thinner then the usual poutine sauce but clearly more flavourful. Cheese was use sparingly and the fry could be crisper.

Next time I will try the hamburger but for the moment I am happy that chicken is back in town. I could easily see them serve chicken and Waffle and that would be someone dank!"
Toyo,3,"Unpleasant service from a gentleman (the lady was more friendly), we almost gave up and ate elsewhere. There were no other customers but he was impatient for us to make our choices. Otherwise food ok, Chinese mall food. No plum sauce with eggrolls, only cherry sauce."
Toyo,1,"In (fast) delivery via Uber Eats, I ordered the Chinese plate.
Very light tasting wonton soup, too much dough vs meat.
Horrible rice bathed in soy sauce, tasteless noodles.
The eggroll and the two chicken balls were good though, luckily!
Honestly disappointed, I don't think I will be going back.

I visited this restaurant on site, no better‚Ä¶ The food is terribly lacking in taste. To avoid."
Toyo,5,The best! His Chinese plate is excellent! Her portions are generous! WonTon soup contains more than a noodle! The owner really cares about his plates and his customers!
Toyo,3,"The food is good, but the front desk clerk seems really really really tired of doing his job. It's heavy to order with him."
Toyo,1,It's overpriced cheap Chinese with ridiculous portions and styrofoam plates.. I recommend you to go to the Thai express next door
Sushi Taxi (Ste-Foy),5,"I recently had the pleasure of lunching at Sushi Taxi, an exceptional sushi restaurant that left an indelible impression on my taste buds.

The menu showcases a tantalizing array of sushi creations, each a masterpiece in its own right. The freshness and quality of the ingredients were evident in every bite."
Sushi Taxi (Ste-Foy),5,"I really loved this place! It wasn‚Äôt crowded at all, and the food was delicious. It brought me back memories "
Sushi Taxi (Ste-Foy),5,"The sushi tastes great. My friends and I wanted to order sushi to take out and we didn't have much time to wait, and they have the solution! They had the already prepared sushi in boxes. Although they didn't display it. So we can just asked them in the counter, pay, and go. Nice! The lady in the counter was also really nice to suggest how much we better ordered and she was right. The amount was enough for 3 of us. We were satisfied with the sushi!"
Sushi Taxi (Ste-Foy),4,"Great food, beautiful presentation and nice staff but it's slow!"
Sushi Taxi (Ste-Foy),4,"All is good, except the speed of service."
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Boulevard Hamel),5,"We had some great service...
Friendly guys ..
Their suggestion today was to get a bowl ...
Spicy chicken , Extra hot beef
Absolutely delicious...
If you're looking for Mexican this is the place to be fast and fresh....
Lots of parking..
Lots of seats ..."
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Boulevard Hamel),3,Pretty good but everytime I get diarrhea
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Boulevard Hamel),5,"pretty good
prices are accurate for the portions
staff is nice"
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Boulevard Hamel),5,I loved this place üòÉ big and tasty amounts of food 
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Boulevard Hamel),2,The hosts can converse in English. Rice and salad were fresh but the protein (chicken and fish) was dry and chewy. The portion size was significantly smaller than I have had from other locations.
Sushi Shop (615 Blvd. Wilfrid-Hamel) - Qu√©bec,1,"I ordered by telephone in advance, but still had to wait 20 min for them to make my order when I went to pick it up. The woman working there even asked a client who had just ordered if it was okay if she make my order first since I couldn't wait?! Even though I ordered a salmon and shrimp burrito , they made this instead and by the time I got it I couldn't wait for them to fix my order. The mango was hard and still had peel on it. It was also so spicy I couldn't eat it and it tasted disgusting. Avoid this sushi shop at all costs."
Sushi Shop (615 Blvd. Wilfrid-Hamel) - Qu√©bec,1,"Waiting 1h for my order on uber eats when I receive a notification  from uber eats telling: ""The restaurant informed that you called and cancelled your order""

Obviously I didn't call to cancel, at least inform the real motive, now I'm waiting for my refund...

Will never order again."
Sushi Shop (615 Blvd. Wilfrid-Hamel) - Qu√©bec,5,Wow the sushis are amazing and the worker are so sweet
Sushi Shop (615 Blvd. Wilfrid-Hamel) - Qu√©bec,2,"I must tell you that I have been a loyal Sushishop customer for years, however this is the 2nd time that I am very disappointed with my order at this branch, having had a bad experience the 1st time I decided to leave a 2nd chance, my spouse went to pick up our order, we were missing 2 cherry blossoms, we only had 6, the employee mentioned that she had made 6 instead of 8 because she thought it was big.. let me tell you it was normal size, not to mention the other sushi in our order was tiny and soaked with water.. and no shrimp in 3 of our spicy shrimp sushi and forgetting our teriyaki bomb.. the spicy mayonnaise expires on March 18, we are on the 11th and frankly it does not smell good.. a nice $70 bill for not eating them.. The teriyaki bombs do not appear in the photos, they are the only ones we have eaten."
Sushi Shop (615 Blvd. Wilfrid-Hamel) - Qu√©bec,1,"I love sushi shop, but this branch is to be avoided unfortunately. I went 3 times and it was ok, but the last time the tables were dirty, no hand soap in the bathroom and when I mentioned it to the young girl at the counter she clearly left me knowing it wasn't his problem. Too bad, because I think this sushi shop is well located."
Zeitoun Cuisine Libanaise,2,"Just stopped for tea‚Ä¶ place seems alright but we had to ask 3 times for honey, never got it. Had to wait 20min for hot water and team would not give us a spare plate to share food."
Zeitoun Cuisine Libanaise,5,Incredible food! I‚Äôve shared a chicken pita and both agreed that it was one of the best pitas we‚Äôve ever had
Zeitoun Cuisine Libanaise,5,"Wow very pleased with my experience
The quality of ingredients is 10/10
Best falafel i ever add
Friendly staff 5 star"
Zeitoun Cuisine Libanaise,5,Delightful fresh flavor of Lebanon. Some of the best kofta we've had anywhere.
Zeitoun Cuisine Libanaise,5,Great food and super service! I will recommend it for sure
Caf√© La Maison Smith (Chemin St-Louis),1,Cappuccino served cold-warm and a staff explained to me why Cappuccino should be made cold-warm. A hostile staff (a white girl with black hair) gave me lots of dirty looks yet she was very nice to white customers. I need to talk with the boss to correct such stupidity.
Caf√© La Maison Smith (Chemin St-Louis),5,A decent coffee shop near my house.
Caf√© La Maison Smith (Chemin St-Louis),1,A racist place to go. These white staff serve white people and colored people in very different ways. I plan to go there again and make a video and post on youtube.
Caf√© La Maison Smith (Chemin St-Louis),5,"I loved the cafee, ambiance and happy, lively environment here!"
Caf√© La Maison Smith (Chemin St-Louis),5,Lovely outdoor area with many tables/chairs. Inside..many tables occupied by laptop folks.
Piment Vert (Le Plateau),5,The food is fresh and very good. Fast service and the employees who receive us inspire good humor. Would go back anytime. I recommend the restaurant.
Piment Vert (Le Plateau),3,No chicken in the burrito despite the picture but the chicken pibil bowl was delicious
Piment Vert (Le Plateau),5,"I LOVED my experience! From the welcome to the delivery of the meal!

I recommend to everyone!"
Piment Vert (Le Plateau),5,
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (7414 50 Ave Red Deer),3,"Normally the food is really good, but yesterday was certainly an ""off day"".
The bucket of chicken (16 pieces) was good, but we ordered 5 chicken strips as well (pre-supper snack). These were the worst I've eaten in a long time.
Dry and tough, could barely finish - in fact a couple just got thrown out.
Normally the strips are a decent size, and juicy and flavorful - these were small and tasted like they were from the previous day and microwaved.
Normally I would rate Popeye's over the other chicken shops in town, but not this time."
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (7414 50 Ave Red Deer),5,"This is always one of our go to restaurants anytime we travel. Great that we now have Popeyes Louisiana kitchen in Red Deer. It was a great relief.

The chicken, biscuits and the mash potatoes are so great and tastes very yummy... It never goes wrong. We will surely visit again and again...."
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (7414 50 Ave Red Deer),2,"Went through the drive threw just now. They forgot my fries, no big deal, brought me the fries. I then asked for ketchup the girl rolled her eyes at me. Not impressed with that type of response‚Ä¶..and they didn‚Äôt give me a fork for my coleslaw‚Ä¶..fantastic‚Ä¶am I supposed to eat that with my hands? In a roll today people."
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (7414 50 Ave Red Deer),1,I ordered a 3 piece tender combo and a 2 piece chicken combo. I got 1 box of chicken and 4 boxes of medium fries. Went back to the window and the lady just hands me another box of chicken. I get there‚Äôs a language barrier but the workers should be somewhat able to understand English. $34 for fries I never ordered is crazy. Get new drive through workers.
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (7414 50 Ave Red Deer),1,"Not sure what is going on but they are NOT cooking the chicken long enough!!! Went there yesterday and my sister and I both got raw chicken!!!!‚Äô Yuck!!!!! And the fries where cold and old!
What a waste of money!!!! Cook it longer geez üòí I used to love Popeyes :("
A&W (50th Avenue),5,"Early this morning I ordered and paid. The girl then tells me they were on special and she overcharged me. She reimbursed me and saved me 6 bucks. It's just the point, not about the money. Went out of her way. Kudos to you lady. Thank you very much and I'll be returning because of the wonderful service. Rarely seen in this town. This one definitely deserves a raise. üôÇ"
A&W (50th Avenue),5,Went through the drive through and the managers deal didn't go through and the girl working noticed and gave us our refund. We probably wouldn't have realized. The girl working is always friendly as well!
A&W (50th Avenue),5,"What I like about this location is they never hesitate to fix the orders if something is wrong. No place is perfect but if they‚Äôll fix it , I‚Äôm happy. My interactions are positive there almost 100 percent of the time with staff. Managers are always great .  Overall I would recommend this location . I also like that they accept expired coupons, would be even better if we could reuse them until they expire."
A&W (50th Avenue),1,"Absolutely disgusting employees at the front for customer service.I was new in Canada and was unaware about their drinks and I asked if they have coffee frappe? Surprisingly, the order taker who was right in front of me replied in a harsh tone ‚ÄúIts not McDonald‚Äôs.!‚Äù I was thinking about what to say there and I just took another drink and left the place. I mean, was that really a GREETING FOR THEIR NEW GUEST?"
A&W (50th Avenue),1,I went to get 3 buddy burgers 2 drinks and 2 fries after paying got 1 correct drink and 1 that I didn‚Äôt ask for and said it was fine after having the take-out lady being extremely rude and well waiting for our food they were looking over and laughing and was handed out food off ‚Äúhere‚Äôs your food ‚Äú rudely which had 3 burgers and 1 fries went to go in to ask for the fries as I paid for them and they just looked at me and didn‚Äôt come to the door. I‚Äôve ordered from here countless times with my order always wrong or cold and with hair in it. 1 of the burgers has hair in it along with the fries which turned our stomachs and throw the food out. Will not be coming here again...
7-Eleven (3803 40 Ave),5,"My wife and I went to East 40th Pub for the first time, we had a fantastic time! Immediately we were made to feel like long time regulars. The place had an electric atmosphere, and even though it was really busy, we felt like the wait staff was on top of their game. Karaoke was a blast, I'm not good, but the energy of the crowd was super accepting of even me! We are giving up on our previous drinking hole for East 40th. Billie was absolutely awesome!"
7-Eleven (3803 40 Ave),2,Stopped in here for dinner and had a poor experience. The waitress (one for the whole place) was running everywhere and had no time for us to order. The bartender closed up a tab and got yelled at by the patron. The yelling continued and we left. I have never felt more uncomfortable being a bystander.
7-Eleven (3803 40 Ave),4,"A good old neighborhood pub.
Plenty of regulars and kind of an old school atmosphere.
They host a pool league, have karaoke and live music from time to time.
It's a reliable go to place for a few drinks when you aren't into doing anything too over the top. You can wear a suit or a sweatpants and not be judged either way.
I like this place and have gone there off and on for years.
They offer food as well."
7-Eleven (3803 40 Ave),5,"I left my truck there for the night and forgot to lock it, I gave the wonderful staff a call and they were nice enough to go out and lock it for me. Great waitresses!"
7-Eleven (3803 40 Ave),5,"Love East 40, great staff, great food. Been going there for years. Throwback to the great bars years gone by. Go enjoy it."
Burger King (7142 50th Avenue),3,"I‚Äôm too much of a fatty to give them a lower score. The whopper always hits. The poutine still tastes the same as when I was younger. Get some onion rings and chicken fries for good measure. I tried the spicy chicken sando, it was ok but I prefer popeyes. My chicken fingers were cold so not great here. I honestly think you should stick to the classics here, get a whopper and an original chicken sandwich with a poutine. They also forgot my chicken sandwich but I went back in to get it. Try the zesty sauce, it‚Äôs aite."
Burger King (7142 50th Avenue),2,"Zero attention to detail,  sauces all on one side of the sandwich.  My melt wasn't at all melted,  I'm sure less then half the spec for toppings were used.  Avoid this location.  No greeting at all.  Just stood at the till and waited staring at us."
Burger King (7142 50th Avenue),4,"Quality food, every time. Fries (and other sides) are always hot, and freshly done with each order. Customer service is alright, some of the staff are hard to understand, or you have to repeat your order to a few times, but overall, I quite enjoy B.K"
Burger King (7142 50th Avenue),2,"Ask for plain and get a fully loaded burger, great logic.  burgers are okay when you get what you ask for, same with the poutines but i've had them forget the bacon on mine before so take that as you will."
Burger King (7142 50th Avenue),5,This Burger King is located on the North of Red deer.  I enjoyed the crispy chicken sandwich meal. A sprite to drink. This restaurant is VERY clean and quiet. I give it a 9 out of 10.
"Dairy Queen (2110, 90 Thorburn Ave)",4,"I love the spoon doorknobs when you go into the store, it makes the whole place more fun and inviting. I love all the blizzards and the different billard menus there, the blizzards take a while for me to get though from the time I order to the time I have it in my hand but it is still great and the classic flip is so unique!"
"Dairy Queen (2110, 90 Thorburn Ave)",5,"Friendly staff, and they got the order right the first time, no arguing over replacement ingredient charges."
"Dairy Queen (2110, 90 Thorburn Ave)",4,It's clean. The older dude and the lady with the face piercings get it perfect every order. Other employees are confused so it's 4/5 instead of higher in my rating... The drive-thru is the best DQ drive-thru in red deer. I wish the Ukrainian restaurant next to the drive thru entrance didn't have vulgar swear words in their signage but dairy queen can't control that and apparently neither can the RCMP. Total rating for this business would be 4.5 out of 5 if all the staff was consistently as good as some of the staff.
"Dairy Queen (2110, 90 Thorburn Ave)",4,Food was great. Fast food prices  are getting a little wild though for what you get.  Good enough. But good for DQ
"Dairy Queen (2110, 90 Thorburn Ave)",3,"First, I‚Äôd like to note the staff at this location are delightful, friendly, and probably the best of any fast food place I‚Äôve eaten.  What does trouble me is the quality of the order.  We like blizzards and frequent often, however many times our order is either wrong (not putting extra cheesecake bites after paying for them), or they are runny and you end up drinking it, or it‚Äôs 3/4 of the cup.  There is always something that seems to not be done correctly. I will continue to frequent this location in hopes that that we will eventually be satisfied as it‚Äôs close to our home. In my wife‚Äôs high school days, she was an employee so she knows the standard lol."
Little Caesars (6791 50th Ave) - Red Deer,2,"This pizza was horrible. Pizza was old and burnt. Most of the pepperoni had black burnt sides and made the pizza bitter and disgusting. Probably one of the worst pizza I had ever ate. Cheese was ok and the crust was dry. I believed if they would give us a fresh pizza, it would have been better. Customer service and atmosphere was okay."
Little Caesars (6791 50th Ave) - Red Deer,1,I don‚Äôt know who answered the phone but they were very snippy and did not tell us. When we went into the store to pick it up she was very rude and demanding as well. Definitely poor service
Little Caesars (6791 50th Ave) - Red Deer,3,"... maybe better cold? Greasy, pretty ""thrifty"" on the toppings and the crust bottom was floppy beyond belief, nearly loosing the gold. On the other hand service was fast and friendly. Was in and out in 8 minutes! Very clean and organized store."
Little Caesars (6791 50th Ave) - Red Deer,1,"Slowest one of them all, ordered my food online, 25 minutes has gone by still not ready, walk into the store one guy standing around doing nothing one lady talking on her phone hiding in the back..

Not impressed. Do better"
Little Caesars (6791 50th Ave) - Red Deer,1,Extremely over priced and wasn't good at all. Pizza ( reg pepperoni) crazy bread and boneless bites ( chicken nuggets)  somehow cost me $38
Mandarin Restaurant BBQ&Grill,5,"Not sure why this place has such a low rating as we've tried a couple other places in town and this one was the best out of all of them. We had the ginger beef, mixed vegetables,salt and pepper dry ribs, and chicken Shanghai noodles. All were beyond delicious especially the ginger beef and the dry ribs. The rice was the only one that was a little lackluster but it's just rice I guess. Definitely a spot to try and we did take out and it was still crispy and delicious when we ate it at home."
Mandarin Restaurant BBQ&Grill,4,"Good food, good service - had supper with my wife and son. He ordered teriyaki chicken, which was a large portion and he loved it. She had the beef hot pot and it was delicious. I ordered the chicken noodle dish and requested for szechuan sauce which they did. Waiter was friendly and very accomodating."
Mandarin Restaurant BBQ&Grill,1,"I ordered over 159$ of food but was told I could only have 4 pieces of cutlery, which cost less then a cent.
Now 3 of my guests are sick in the bathrooms.
Do not ever order from this disgusting, cheap restaurant.
This is obscene customer service and 100$ of food that has to be thrown out because they didn't care.
Disgusting taste. Probably food poisoning. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM ü§¨"
Mandarin Restaurant BBQ&Grill,5,All dishes were very tasty except the chicken fried rice which just didn't have much flavor. Teriyaki chicken was delicious with huge chunks of chicken. Would eat here again.
Mandarin Restaurant BBQ&Grill,2,"Ordered from here last night and was very disappointed in the flavors of everything. The ginger beef, beef and broccoli and even the won ton soup all lacked flavor it was so bland that no one in the house would finish any of their dishes. The ginger beef was so dried out the kids were calling it ginger beef jerky."
Pink Bow Restaurant,5,"love this place. Went here today fpr one year anniversary. Some lovely person did pay it forward‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è    I highly recommend this place for food and drinks!! Bubble tea is to die for, and there crepes are scrumptious. Lovely people working here as well!!"
Pink Bow Restaurant,5,"We dined here on Saturday, March 11, 2023.
The service was phenomenal, and the food was delightful.
Our appetizer was Takoyaki and was served elegantly and with lovely flavour! For the main course we tried the Steak Hot Plate, and the Eel Hot Plate.
The steak was Asian style, served very thin on a sizzling pan with pleasant seasoning. The eel was presented covered in a gorgeous sauce and cooked just right. Many sides are available, we chose noodles and steamed vegetables, along with a teriyaki sauce that was flavourful but not overpowering.
We tried a few of the many dessert offerings I would suggest that you can't go wrong! They are very generous in size but still somehow feel delicate and special. Strongly recommend the bubble waffles!! Will definitely be going back!"
Pink Bow Restaurant,5,"What lacks in popularity is none other than a restaurant as hidden as this, because you are sure to hit a mouth-watering taste of Japan's specialties and richness of flavor. Meet the Pink Bow Restaurant, a classic, but modern take on the Ramen or Eastern Cuisine business. Aligned with Oishidesu Ramen, which is another Ramen restaurant, it missed the spot in the quantity and quality control of the food.

That's where Pink comes in, as the Ramen I've ordered here (Tonkotsu/Pork) has a distinct flavor of smoky and tender juiciness, imbuing itself into the broth. The egg that came along with it also gives a balance of salty and savory, as it has been in a brine (based on my visual judgement) to tell me they put love into that. The noodles also aren't super thin or yeasty as you would see in packets, which is a big plus if you tell me. The crepe is an interesting one; it is very light, yet somehow very filling. The combination of fruits and dessert dressings, provided that they can also be the main course, tricks your brain into thinking you are full but aren't. The drink that I've been offered is a Bubble Tea fusion for the Philippines (ie. Halo-Halo,) a special deal for those looking at that sweet taste of the Ube (purple yam.)

Atmosphere wise, it *IS* modern, but it might need to emphasize more on the Japanese aspect (the Lucky cat curtains is kinda cute not gonna lie.) The lights are pleasant, alongside a chalkboard of the many ways to get exclusive discounts; no, you cannot just openly say you're this or that unless you prove it. The size of the restaurant, from a certain point of view, are sized like the alleyway ramen shops in Japan, so how else would it not be small? There is also some wall decals, with the biggest eye catcher being the flow of leaves coming off a tree.

The service; pfft who am I to judge? It's great! The person I've talked to is someone ""who is a fast eater."" She knows I'd eat fast, so hey, experience (as a story and entertainer skill) is good to have! I'm willing to come back here sometime to treat my family once I've gotten the payroll. If you want a full-filling stomach, then your money is worth every cent with this restaurant.

Note: I would have chosen the Pork Ramen in the Beta features of Google reviews, but it is not there after the writing of this review (somehow...)"
Pink Bow Restaurant,5,Always love going here. Love the Teriyaki chicken crepe and the Pink Bow crepe best. The dusted logo on the drinks is a cute touch
Pink Bow Restaurant,5,"Excellent food and custom service. Thank you for a great 1st time experience üòÅ
Thank you"
Swiss Chalet (5111-22nd St Unit 8),5,"Eating at Swiss Chalet in Red Deer, when I tried a new drink and didnt like it the server, Catherine, was so nice and offered me a different drink. So nice to have a gluten free meal with no worries about getting sick. The food was amazing and the atmosphere was very comfortable and friendly. Defiantly will be coming back!!"
Swiss Chalet (5111-22nd St Unit 8),5,"This location is amazing we called ahead to place an order while we were driving through so our cranky kids could eat quickly. They were so friendly!! Got everything correct and the food was ready as soon as we sat down. The food was fabulous and delicious and it was just a perfect experience all around. We shared this with the manager who said they are under new management and try their best to have a high level of customer service. üëè they do, 10/10 recommend it!"
Swiss Chalet (5111-22nd St Unit 8),5,"Honestly, the most accurate word they comes to mind, is ""Splendid"".  Server was pleasant and polite.  The meal portion size is great.  Variety on menu is more than expected.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  I had absolutely Zero complaints.  Whole family enjoyed."
Swiss Chalet (5111-22nd St Unit 8),5,"It is the most amazing take out and dine in experience. The staff is really nice and even gives finer bowls to kids, at least for the kids chicken fingers. They never forget anything in the takeout order like some other places do and it‚Äôs over a really nice restaurant and I would highly recommend."
Swiss Chalet (5111-22nd St Unit 8),5,"So here we were in RedDeer Alberta going to stop at a Restaurant with a US States name, too long a wait time, and spotted the Swiss Chalet. So glad we did. Food was extraordinary. Rohan was our server who made the whole dining experience extra special. Thank you"
Denny's (2940 50th Ave),5,"Really lovely atmosphere, friendly waitresses, especially Cathy. I came here at 12am with my sister, got some delicious food, which was served really quickly and fresh. Definitely would be coming back again"
Denny's (2940 50th Ave),5,Today was my first time in Denny‚Äôs and I immediately felt welcomed. My friend and I were seated right away and handed the menu. A server by the name of Arlene made me feel like a valued customer because she would always check up on us and asked if we needed anything else or if she could help in any way. She was also very bright and went to us with a smile. For my first time here I felt like home and I definitely recommend it to anyone else looking for a good and welcoming place. 5/5 Stars Thanks for the good experience. Will definitely come back :) !
Denny's (2940 50th Ave),5,We went around supper time. Food was great and the serving is huge! The Service is fast and we have Server Arlene who took care of us! She is very friendly and very accomodating
Denny's (2940 50th Ave),5,"Take my Autistic boy here often, he loves it. The staff are always so friendly and accommodating. The food is awesome and the atmosphere if light and family orientated. Always our #1 choice."
Denny's (2940 50th Ave),5,"The waiter Terri was extremely attentive, but not to the point of being distracting. She was also very kind and easy going. Made ordering a lot easier. The caramel banana pancakes were definitely something to write home about! Definitely a must try!"
Western Pizza,5,"I have been coming to this place for years, and I am still always amazed when I grab my pizza by how heavy it is!! I honestly don't think there's anything here that I've ordered that I didn't like...
Some of the better donairs in town, perhaps that's my opinion...
But they also make other sandwiches, as well as salads and many delicious appetizers like jalapeno poppers.
Chicken wings are also amazing here!

I am, and always will be thankful that Western pizza exists! And I will continue to always order my pizza from here as well as my side items!!"
Western Pizza,4,"Perhaps a bit pricey but you definitely get a good heavy topping filled pizza for the price. You pick up the box and you just can feel it‚Äôs not all dough!

Super friendly and delicious!"
Western Pizza,2,"Used to eat here once a week growing up. If I wasn‚Äôt eating pizza I‚Äôd get the bad boy burger and fries. Decided to revisit my childhood today. Ordered a burger and fries. They used to have really good steak cut fries.. they don‚Äôt anymore. The burger patty‚Äôs used to be thick and juicy.. they aren‚Äôt anymore. Burger was thin and burnt. Lady wasn‚Äôt very helpful, tried asking if they had steak cut fries or not and she didn‚Äôt know what that meant.. said they had large or small. I think they have good pizza still.. won‚Äôt be getting a burger from here ever again although they used to be my favorite."
Western Pizza,1,"Their prices are unreasonably high for pizza. They wouldn't honor the price on the menu I ordered from (taped to the counter) because that menu was 'old'. They should only have one advertised price for food. I see other reviews mentioning this, which tells me they don't care and they charge what they want.

Their sizes are also misleading. A medium pizza is 12 inches, but they sell a 10 inch medium.

""How much bigger is a 12 inch pizza than a 10-inch pizza? About 44% larger, considering the area of the pie. The area of a round pie is proportional to the square of the diameter. The diameter of a 12 inch pie is 1.2 times the diameter of a 10 inch pie, and 1.2 squared is 1.44, or 44 % larger.""

If a Western Pizza medium pizza is 44% smaller than all other medium pizzas in Red Deer, why are they charging so much more for it?"
Western Pizza,1,"This will be the last time we order from Western Pizza. 2 orders of popcorn shrimp, only one came with seafood sauce. We didn‚Äôt get the fries just asked for extra salad, they sent Caesar salad with both orders, no salad dressing and the price for this was ridiculous. We were loyal customers but there‚Äôs been too many screw ups lately. We‚Äôre done ordering from hereüò°"
Montana's (Red Deer),5,"Montana's is the perfect place for our family to celebrate Mother's day together. The food was awesome and the prices were fair. On top of that, we had a really great server who greeted us with a smile and accommodated us. Paige G. was really kind and made our dining experience even better! I highly recommend this place!"
Montana's (Red Deer),5,Came for our sons 13th birthday. They made us feel extra special and made his day. Thank you for the amazing service from Jay she is a keeper
Montana's (Red Deer),5,Stacey was a wonder server.  We had a large family group and she kept us all happy.  The food was delicious.
Montana's (Red Deer),5,We had a pretty large size group of friends together for dinner and our waiter Tyler was very attentive and friendly! Thank you for the great service!!
Montana's (Red Deer),5,"The steaks and ribs were excellent! Nice fries and baked beans too. The onion rings could‚Äôve been a touch crisper.  Overall it was a very nice meal.
Sou was terrific as our server and really took great care of the 4 of us for a family meal."
Edo Japan -  Gaetz South,3,This restaurant was okay. The portions were not outstanding but the service was friendly despite the food being a. It expensive.
Edo Japan -  Gaetz South,5,"Easy to order, good signage, prices reasonable. Food delicious, hot even after walking home. Nicely spiced spring rolls. Noodle option nice. First time for Bento Box."
Edo Japan -  Gaetz South,5,"Great location, come here for lunch most Sundays and the service is excellent, very fast and excellent food for a reasonable price. The young lady working Sunday is very polite as well."
Edo Japan -  Gaetz South,5,So tasty! The portions of the bento boxes were great. There's less veg than usual but that's understandable because of inflations/shortages! A super clean restaurant with super friendly staff. Thanks a bunch!
Edo Japan -  Gaetz South,3,"Overall the newest location on 50th Avenue was not bad, organized and clean. Customer service was fair still have a few minor areas to adjust. Only complaint is currently the installed radio playing from the ceiling. Volume level is a tad much, the heavy bass echoing from the music playing. Overwhelms customers or staff speaking to each other clearly it's very problematic."
KFC (4834 - 53rd Street),4,"I appreciate the service of Phoenix, who ‚Äòmade it right‚Äô today when I got home to discover my take out order was incorrect. Also the delivery driver who brought me the correct order.

I suggest you be very clear when ordering take out to be sure the girl knows for sure what you want,  and to double check before you drive away."
KFC (4834 - 53rd Street),5,"I Ordered an 18 piece with 5 sides. Excellent customer service over the phone, super fast delivery and great food. By far the best KFC experience in years. Well done!!"
KFC (4834 - 53rd Street),1,I mean this place is great if you want food that is rotten. My coleslaw was either rancid or stored wrong‚Ä¶.  It had a terrible metallic taste and stench. They don‚Äôt care if you do delivery‚Ä¶.. still get paid and no recourse for the customer. Absolutely repulsive food
KFC (4834 - 53rd Street),1,"Absolutely the most awful service consistently at this location. Tried to get lunch there again today (third attempt, three strikes your out) and despite only being on other customer in the place, was left standing at the till for over 5 minutes with no ""we will be right with you"" or anything other then looks of distain from the kitchen, I left once again without a lunch! Would not recommend this place to anyone! If i could give no stars I would"
KFC (4834 - 53rd Street),1,"Terrible customer service. I placed an online order for pickup. I ordered a 10-piece bucket, large fries, large gravy and large potato salad. I got an 18-piece bucket and two large gravy.  What is the point of ordering online if these mistakes still happen? The woman behind the counter said ""It says 18 on my screen. You got 18 pieces,"" as if I made away like a thief in the night.  Maybe get my order right. Never again, KFC."
The Hideout,4,I've eaten here a handful of times. Good food and good service. The only thing that I can't stand about The Hideout is that your drink will taste like a Cesar even if you order a Pepsi or water. Really off putting to have that taste if you don't like Cesar's. Probably unhygienic too
The Hideout,3,Hade better steak Sandwich‚Äôs.  Service was just ok.  Had to ask for condiments.  Server took my napkin before I was done eating.   All said is was pretty good.
The Hideout,1,"We were so disappointed, went here for Father's day dinner. We were seated quickly, waited 20 minutes to get our drinks, at the hour mark still no food, our waitress was no where to be found! We got one refill of our drinks. My husband and myself could not eat the food as its was just horrible! Food arrived after an hour and 20 minutes!!! What a waste of our time and money"
The Hideout,4,"We were a group of 22 so we expected some delays and mixups. There were none. Food and drinks came promptly, the young female server was around checking in, bringing all the extras when asked and was prompt with the bills.  The food came quick and everyone seemed happy with their experience.  I would go back."
The Hideout,5,"It was great honestly. Service was some of the best I've had in a long time, coffee was fresh though maybe a touch on the weak side but very good, and food was timely and flavorful. Overall a great night out, and I can't wait to come again"
Wendy's (6781 Gaetz Avenue),3,Food is great. The washrooms however are inconvenient. Someone needs to tell the installers that the tp comes out the bottom of the dispenser! If the last user didn't leave a tail to grab it is impossible to get your hand inside to reach the roll while sitting.
Wendy's (6781 Gaetz Avenue),1,"Went through drive through tonight. Brought home the order and only had 4 nuggets instead of 6. I tried calling the restaurant to see if we were maybe charged for the wrong order. As there was not a receipt included i did not know. When i called it rang several times until .... well, I'm not sure what happened, an answering machine picked up or a fax beeped in. As I was trying to leave a message, it seems someone picked up and hung up the phone. I tried to call back no one answered at all.

I understand staff shortages but I just wanted to ask how many nuggets should be in the pack."
Wendy's (6781 Gaetz Avenue),2,"Give your paying customers an actual minute to read the menu before starting with your misplaced attitude.  That is the whole point of a menu board, after all.  I would train you myself, but I have another job where I don't act snarky to people that pay my salary.

If this is how they act outwardly, lord only knows how they handle your food.

Spent $30.00 (average order).  Burger was drenched in mayo to the point that it was dripping off.  Bun was wet greasy on the top, which is kind of disgusting.

Next time I'll just go to the south location."
Wendy's (6781 Gaetz Avenue),5,"I had 2 baked potatoes with sour cream, chives and bacon!  So delicious!  And I wasn't too full feeling.  That was all I had for supper that day.  And it was sufficient."
Wendy's (6781 Gaetz Avenue),5,"Always loved their food, tastes fresh always, amazing salads. Customer service is always on par. If you want some quick fast food, this is a great choice."
MOXIES (Red Deer),1,"Well, again moxies seems to aim to displease. Unfortunately. I can hear once months ago and absolutely loved it!
The last few weeks I‚Äôve ordered take out once, and dined in once.

When I ordered take out the for my whole family (5x) I ordered chicken tenders and fries for my 2 girls, they chicken was way way over fried. Also ordered 2 asparagus garlic and salmon pasta. The one was great! But the one piece of salmon was so over cooked and charred.
Decided to dine in today. First off, I‚Äôm heavily pregnant (due in 5 days) and I was seated at a booth. So uncomfortable. I again asked for the summer seasonal of asparagus Garlic and salmon. With them telling me they are all out of pasta? How‚Äôs that possible? My son ordered pasta (chicken Alfredo?) but they are out. I seen recent reviews this is not the first time they have ‚Äúbeen out‚Äù of this dish. Our waiter also tucked us way in the SE corner. Never asked to refill our drinks(we sat almost the whole time without drinks/empty cups). Barley checked on us. I was so frustrated with the last 2 experiences. So I settled for a steak and potatoes with veggies. The asparagus was so bitter. The potato‚Äôs were so salty and having nothing to drink made it hard to keep eating them.

I‚Äôm not one to complain cause hey, things happen etc. I didn‚Äôt when I ordered out. But again a second time. Nope, not happy.

I won‚Äôt be recommending this place to anyone anymore after these last 2 experiences. Unfortunately."
MOXIES (Red Deer),2,"It was my first experience with Moxies! I was so excited to go there, and now I‚Äôm disappointed. I wanted to order salmon, this dish was in the seasonal menu, I was so excited! but they told me that their salmon was frozen. i said ‚Äúoh no‚Äù, and the waitress told me that today couple of guests tried to order this dish a couple of times, I asked why is it frozen? she said she doesn‚Äôt know.. I was confused. in the restaurant the menu had more than 2 dishes with salmon, today is Sunday, 2 dishes with salmon in seasonal menu, A COUPLE OF TIMES SOMEBODY WANTED TO ORDER THIS DISH, and it is not quite a low price category, the salmon is frozen .. in this situation, I thought that it would be better if they said that they sold it, but so... the salmon is frozen, we're a restaurant that sells salmon, but sorry, it's frozen. it was the first.

I ordered pasta, which had the line ""add salmon"" but it was frozen how you can remember. as for me, the pasta was raw and asparagus with bitterness. I'm upset with my choice.

my boyfriend ordered a double bacon double cheese cheeseburger, but they brought us another burger. which had neither cheese nor bacon. we told the waitress about this, but she said that the chef simply forgot to add bacon! I don't like it when they try to make fools out of us, and instead of saying that we gave you someone else's burger, we'll say that let's bring you bacon to your burger. in the check it was BACON CHEESBURGER, as it turned out without cheese and without bacon .. we were offered a dessert at their expense, but we are not lovers of desserts.

I would not recommend this place to my friends and I will not come here again.

Hope somebody will get this salmon which they save for a special occasion."
MOXIES (Red Deer),5,"Love Brooklyn! Amazing service on the lounge side, comfortable atmosphere, and amazing Ros√© Sangria. I mainly come for the brownie of course but loved my salmon ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thanks Brooklyn for a lovely experience! Will be back ü•∞"
MOXIES (Red Deer),3,"The food was ok, not fabulous. I had the chicken and ribs, but it was really salty. The service was really nice and accommodating. I will try again in a different city."
MOXIES (Red Deer),4,"Amazing meal. Good portions . Prices  pretty reasonable.  Service was very good . I will keep this place in mind . Thank you  so much.

Second time there was May 03 23 was first date & really great thanks again for a good time ."
Canadian Pizza Unlimited (Clearview),3,"the food is pretty alright  for a pizza place open much later than any other in town, the bonus is the fact it's menu has a ton of options which is nice for when you want a samosa and cheese cake at 3am
.. more desserts"
Canadian Pizza Unlimited (Clearview),5,"Excellent service. Delicious food, Ghazanfar working at the front counter was very customer orientated and always has a smile on his face. Highly recommend it!"
Canadian Pizza Unlimited (Clearview),5,"Pizza tonight super awesome as usual guys!  We are a fussy family and definitely love pizza here best.  Always polite and never late getting food on time.  Will never buy elsewhere, thanks."
Canadian Pizza Unlimited (Clearview),5,"This place is my new regular pizza and donair place, got some of the best food in town, hands down. I'm still trying all their menu items but nothing yet has disappointed! Check 'em out!"
Canadian Pizza Unlimited (Clearview),5,Staff is friendly and they are generous with their toppings.  One of the best pizzas in red deer
Cosmic Pizza & Donair (Red Deer),5,"Yummy pizza as usual üçï We've got large with meat super delicious. 10 min was a waiting time. Guys works fast, thanks!"
Cosmic Pizza & Donair (Red Deer),5,"1st time trying this new place. Staff member was very friendly and chatted while he was cooking. He kindly gave me a tester of donair meat, I think because he saw me eyeing it. Ordered combo which was X2 12in Pizza's X1 Garlic cheese bread and 2 Litre pop which was 40.00 +/- Pizza looked great as the photo's show. Taste was good and the pizza also reheats in the microwave nicely. Some Pizza's just dont reheat well but these are fine. All in all happy with all."
Cosmic Pizza & Donair (Red Deer),3,"I asked a delivery driver to hand it to me and it was still left in my lobby of my apartment.
Called in terrible customer service during the night shift üëé the crust is really delicious ü§§ the sauce is thin and watery cheese was missing in spots ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èbest wings in town recommend ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Cosmic Pizza & Donair (Red Deer),2,"Friendly staff but the pizza is very bland. Basic sauce  generic crust and the meat isn't the best quality I got a 14"" meatlovers and a side of garlic cheese bread - (which also sucked)"
Cosmic Pizza & Donair (Red Deer),5,Thanks Cosmic Pizza Red Deer for the delicious large pizza. This is one of the BEST! Pizzas I‚Äôve had in over 5 years. I‚Äôll definitely order again.
Foodie Bros,5,"This restaurant is a hidden gem!! We ordered  two pastas and yangneum chicken burger, burger without sauce for my daughter, and popcorn chicken. All of them were superb!! Pastas are of quality you can expect from high end restaurants, loads of fresh ingredients and my husband and I devoured every drop. My daughter, usually hard to impress, gave two thumbs up. Popcorn chicken was great, crispy and delicious sauce. If I had room, I would‚Äôve had another chicken burger, it was crispy and tender with lots of fresh veggies. Homemade sauce makes the burger even better. We live in Calgary and will definitely come back!! Oh and also great customer service!!"
Foodie Bros,5,"This is the best new restaurant in Red Deer. The fried chicken is crispy and saucy, get the traditional yang yum flavour! We got the 3 meat Korean bbq combo, you get beef, chicken and pork. All three are delicious and you get rice, fries and salad with it. We also got the Shanghai seafood spaghetti, this is really special. It‚Äôs like Korean jjampong in a fusion spaghetti dish. I will definitely be back"
Foodie Bros,5,"We went last night as a group of three and ordered three different food, and my personal best dish was the pasta!

It's been a long time since I've eaten such a delicious pasta.  It was real pasta!  Excited to try other pasta.

And the chicken is real Korean style chicken. It is very juicy and soft when hot and even delicious when cold.  Especially the yangyum sauce was delicious.  (‚≠êÔ∏èmust try either side or cover the chicken)

The barbecue platter has so much meat that you can never finish it alone.  If you can't eat a lot, i recommend sharing it with two people.

And compared to price and quality of the food? MUST try üëç

The store is clean and the heater is full, so it was good to eat inside, and the owners are friendly!"
Foodie Bros,5,"My boyfriend and I got delivery for a lunch date it. The food was so delicious and for a good price! We had Pork Galbi bap and mushroom Alfredo they were so flavourful and tasty, you could tell it was very fresh made. The Alfredo was so creamy the sauce was 10/10. I definitely recommend it to my friends. Thanks for the great food!"
Foodie Bros,5,"Had the 3 meat BBQ platter. It was more than enough food for two people. Everything tasted so good and fresh. Menu size is perfect. You can tell that they really care about their quality. Staff was very friendly. I will definitely be back to try more of their food.

Edit: I have been back 2 more times and have tried the YangYum tossed chicken breast, it was so delicious the sauce is such a great combination of sweet sour and spicy. The popcorn chicken puts kfc, and mary browns to shame. And the mushroom alfredo was recommended for me to try and I am so glad I did! It is so cheesy and rich, the sauce was so nice and glossy and just clings to the noodles, I really enjoyed the onion and spinach mixed in."
Papa John's (3701 50Th Av #1),5,Great pizza! phone service was wonderful gave me a good deal and was super polite. She had glasses on and the carry out time is so fast!!
Papa John's (3701 50Th Av #1),5,"I had the best pizza of my life at that time. Since then I have visited this place numerous times and my opinion about this pizza has still not changed.

The service and the food were both excellent. While waiting for your pizza, it force you to have a conversation with one another as your pizza being made. Such a nice atmosphere and lovely working staff."
Papa John's (3701 50Th Av #1),5,"I ordered online for pickup. Pizza tastes great, hot, good deal on Tuesdays, and it even comes with seasoning packages (which aren‚Äôt even needed because the pizza tastes great without it). It was nice to be able to track my order online. The text message notifications did not work though."
Papa John's (3701 50Th Av #1),5,This place has Really great pizza and amazing workers. Would recommend stopping by next time you‚Äôre craving pizza! 10/10.
Papa John's (3701 50Th Av #1),5,"Papa John's pizza is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a delicious, high-quality pizza that is delivered with excellent customer service. With a wide variety of toppings to choose from, Papa John's is sure to have something to satisfy any pizza lover's cravings."
Harvey's (5111 - 22nd St),5,"Visited this Harvey‚Äôs location recently with my child who has a Gluten sensitivity. Ordered a grilled chicken burger for my child with no bun. When the gentleman who took our order noticed my child holding her own bun, he was incredibly kind & offered to take the bun to the back & have the chicken placed on it as well as offered to cook her a special order of fries to ensure they were Gluten free. These kind gestures were beyond appreciated! To have a fast food order ‚Äúnormally‚Äù wrapped that she could eat immediately eat out of the bag without any modifications absolutely made her day! Thank you Harvey‚Äôs Red Deer!"
Harvey's (5111 - 22nd St),1,Couldn't get my order right due to a language barrier. After 4 attempts I decided  it wasn't worth the hastle. I was given the finger by the Owner as I was leaving. Anywhere else is a better idea. Kicker was they had a white lady trying to help but was also busy running the whole kitchen. My heart goes out to that lady.
Harvey's (5111 - 22nd St),5,"I‚Äôve had take-out from here a few times and the food is always consistent and great tasting! The staff is refreshingly personable and friendly - they are helpful when it comes to suggesting sides/drinks/toppings/sauces (basically the best thing to compliment what you ordered, if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with the menu)"
Harvey's (5111 - 22nd St),5,"Whenever you‚Äôre having a bad day just come to Harvey‚Äôs. Maddy always always made us feel so welcomed! I come here with my kid for breakfast as well but most of the time a late night snack place.

We regularly visit Harvey‚Äôs because of the hospitality so warm sure feels like a family!"
Harvey's (5111 - 22nd St),4,"Harvey's & Swiss Chalet need better online directions for access restaurant and parking.
Menu items below do not list what we ordered for 3 adults and 2 children."
Red Swan Pizza (Red Deer - North),5,"Red Swan Pizza makes delicious  food, Me and my whole family loves them!!!"
Red Swan Pizza (Red Deer - North),5,Best pizza in town! When I originally ordered from them I fell asleep before delivery. They called me 5 times before giving up! I then called the next day to pay for my mistake and they refused payment! So of course after that i had to order from them again. I got the nachos and canadian pizza through Skip and i have to say i will only be getting pizza from here from now on. Phenomenal!
Red Swan Pizza (Red Deer - North),5,I've used Red Swan many times now to order a large number of pizzas for a staff event. Customer service has always been fantastic. Everything in the order was correct. They even went the extra mile and helped me load up my car with all the pizzas. The pizza tastes good and overall it's a great experience.
Red Swan Pizza (Red Deer - North),5,The pizza is always excellent at this location and provides very good value for the price. I typically order one of the personal sized pizzas and it's perfect for one person.
Red Swan Pizza (Red Deer - North),5,First time ever going was today! And it won't be my last! Ordered 2 personal pizzas and the price included two cans of pop!  The fella who took my order was patient because I couldn't make up my mind as there were so many delicious choices!  And  the pizza was amazing!  The crust was fluffy!  I will be trying all of the different kinds of pizzas! Recommended!
Subway (206-4900 Molly Bannister Dr),1,"I ordered a foot long flat bread, opened it up as soon as I got home to see it not cut and the bread as soggy as can be with some sort of liquid dripping out. This was not edible and disgusting."
Subway (206-4900 Molly Bannister Dr),5,"They were friendly, efficient, the fella making my sandwich patted the bacon grease twice! Very appreciated! Best of all he was wearing a poppy in April üòç"
Subway (206-4900 Molly Bannister Dr),1,The guy named kalaf was forcing the sand which to close with sauce splattering everywhere. I also said to have it toasted and he didn‚Äôt do that.
Subway (206-4900 Molly Bannister Dr),3,"Not the greatest looking sandwich I've ever purchased, that's for sure. Then again, Subway has gone way downhill over the past few years."
Subway (206-4900 Molly Bannister Dr),5,"This Subway is located inside the bower mall, they have a good staff and service is really good. Subs are good quality. Inexpensive for a quick bite."
Indian BBQ and Grill,5,"Actually it‚Äôs a best restaurant in town
Went for lunch amazing food after that get nostalgia of delhi food . Amazing chilli chicken must try and sizzling tandoori chicken is top notch"
Indian BBQ and Grill,5,"This adorable little restaurant is AMAZING. We have ordered delivery and pick-up (although the place is lovely, cozy, and clean- and we‚Äôll eat in-house soon), and I can tell you, you won‚Äôt find better food in this entire city. Everything we have tried is a solid 10/10!! If you haven‚Äôt eaten here, you are missing out on the most delicious food in RD. Our new favourite place, for sure! Staff are friendly and accommodating, as well. 5 stars, absolutely!!"
Indian BBQ and Grill,5,"This place is the best in Red Deer, offering Indian food. hands down!
We just had our dinner yesterday, and the food was excellent. I asked to meet the chef, and he was such a lovely and humble person, and he spoke with me about his experience in Dubai, as I have lived there for many years. I tried many Indian restaurants, and I can tell by experience their food is fantastic and delicious."
Indian BBQ and Grill,5,"Tammy and I stopped for our first time here this evening. We had a great dinner.
The overall experience was excellent.
Recommendations where given from a very polite and attentive waiter, the food was as promised.
Tasty meal from a menu with many options to choose from.  We‚Äôre going back for sure.
Great team, thank you!"
Indian BBQ and Grill,5,This is our favorite restaurant in Red Deer. We have never had a bad meal. The food is fresh and hot with plenty of choices. The spice levels are customizable in most dishes. We choose medium and it's nicely spiced. I love the mushroom dish and the methi paneer is delicious too. The biryani rice and cheese naans are a must. By far the best Indian food in town.
Quiznos (50th Ave & 60th St),5,"We ordered customized  boxed lunches for a group of 10+ it was ready before we got there, every meal was correct, and the cost was very reasonable,"
Quiznos (50th Ave & 60th St),1,This was what I got for $12 a bunch of bread with slivers of meat on it. Subway gives more food and they're embarrassing aswell. What a joke.
Quiznos (50th Ave & 60th St),5,"Staff is friendly, store is clean, food is delicious. Will return."
Quiznos (50th Ave & 60th St),2,"They were my favorite place for gluten free subs till how I was treated today, over the lady not wanting to tell her boss the truth that she witnessed my partner showing her the coupon we had from the beginning (buy one get one for $.99) and then not honoring it !!!!!
We bought 4 subs so it just wasn't over one sub for .99
I won't be back! I'll find a new favorite and give them my money. üëå

Update they didn't even get my order right lol"
Quiznos (50th Ave & 60th St),5,"I go here for lunch since it‚Äôs near work always get great service, very friendly staff"
Loaded Pierogi (Red Deer),5,I just walked in there today for the first time and i was greeted and got the whole menu explained to me and what they do which was super helpful as i didnt know anything about the place i got the bbq philly steak perogies and im blown away the flavors are extremely  satisfying  and the serving size is perfect it fills your right up and if your picky like me and like more of things or less of things they are very accomidating and super friendly about it. I was very impressed and will definetly be coming back there !! Highly recommend this food place.
Loaded Pierogi (Red Deer),4,"Food was very yummy, good quality however I think the dishes need a little more love & care as they looked very slapped together. I got the baba pierogis and it was delicious tons of toppings but I wish they put sour cream on top instead of the side! My boyfriend got the poutine, but they fries were all stuck together as if they weren‚Äôt picked apart prior to frying, still good tho. Staff was very nice & welcoming as it was our first time."
Loaded Pierogi (Red Deer),5,"Great food, fresh and hot. Service was wonderful as well. We had the super crispy cauliflower, and donair perogies. Delicious!"
Loaded Pierogi (Red Deer),3,The food was quite good but a bit pricy for what you get. I got the mushroom and truffle and my partner got the chicken bacon ranch. Both were good but we wished there was a bit more toppings for both. Super disappointed when it came to the deep fried brownies. They were very oily and not much for toppings...I would have just bought a bag of two bite brownies and taken out the middle man haha. We hope to try it again at a later date!
Loaded Pierogi (Red Deer),5,"Fantastic experience. I highly recommend it!!
Great atmosphere. Bright, open, and welcoming.
The staff is warm, welcoming, and friendly. They answered all my questions and made it easy. They are knowledgeable about all the dishes and their recommendations are spot on.
The meals are versatile too. You have the choice of four bases: Classic Pierogis (Boiled), Crispy Pierogis (Deep Fried), Mac & Cheese, and Poutine. Then you pick from the 12 main dishes for your toppings.
The Snacks (Desserts) menu is something to explore. I'm looking forward to having the Deep-Fried Cheesecake.
I had the Buffalo Chicken and it was amazing!! Just the right amount of spice and sauce on the chicken. Great flavour and a generous amount of toppings!!
Great job John and Staff!!"
Local Croffle House,5,"First time but loved it. Ordered Croffle waffle,croissant. Different but so tasty. Bacon and ham with hash browns. Pretty tasty. Not super busy so food came out fast and hot. The restaurant was attached to the quality Inn. Service was friendly and fast. Very clean. Will be back"
Local Croffle House,5,"Another 5 Star experience dining at this place - thanks to the host Ken for recommending the Hot Rock BBQ, it is the closest thing to a Samyupsal experience in Red Deer. The owner was gracious enough to show us how to properly bbq the meat , and bring out its flavor. Kimchi on the side is definitely a must. Will surely try again."
Local Croffle House,4,Had the croffle and chicken. It was delicious and unique. I would like a little heat in the fried chicken but overall it was great. The reason for four stars is the fries that came with my meal were cold. They tasted good but cold. Also the restaurant was very cold. Not just a little chilly but uncomfortably COLDü•∂ü•∂ü•∂
Local Croffle House,5,"Once you past the somewhat bewildering and cluttered menu, you are in for a treat! I had the chicken and croffle (ie croissant dough waffle) and it was amazing: Perfectly seasoned, well balanced in terms of salty and sweet, and the fried chicken was nice and juicy! The ""crittos"" were also a delightful twist on breakfast potatoes.

Service and atmosphere were also great. Value was exceptional--a must eat in Red Deer!"
Local Croffle House,5,The poutine here is the best I‚Äôve had in many years. The cheese to gravy to crispy fries ratio is perfect and way more than enough to fill me up. I‚Äôll be back and will recommend for sure. Great job!!
Tandoor n' Flame Restaurant & Sweets,5,"Had dinner here with my wife June 2023. I had chicken kadahi my wife had chicken Rogan Josh with saffron rice garlic Nan and papadums. I am always reluctant going to Indian restaurants in Canada as every one I have been in until now have been disappointing. However the food here was very good. The kadahi was excellent very tasty and was much better than I have come to expect in Canada. The Rogan Josh was also very good although not quite what I would expect for the dish as I would have expected it to be more tomato'ey, that said was still very good. The sundries we had were also very good. Restaurant was quiet when we visited and service was great. We will definitely be back."
Tandoor n' Flame Restaurant & Sweets,4,"Food was absolutely delicious. If you want an authentic Indian food experience, this is your place. We ordered the butter chicken and chicken tikka masala with garlic naan. My mouth is watering just thinking about it again! Had to give 4 stars because our menus needed a good wipe and the bathroom was kinda icky. However, I would highly recommend, based solely on the food and good service. We will be back!"
Tandoor n' Flame Restaurant & Sweets,5,I am travelling here from Vancouver. I must say the food was fantastic. i ordered their tikka‚Äôs they were juicy soft and delicious. i highly recommend them.
Tandoor n' Flame Restaurant & Sweets,5,"My boys don‚Äôt like very much but we‚Äôre raving about the service, how he took the time to explain the menu and what would pair well with the dishes they picked, and how amazing the food tastes!!! Thanks so much for the wonderful experience!!"
Tandoor n' Flame Restaurant & Sweets,1,"We were really looking forward to a good experience all around, based on previous reviews.  However we soon realized after we got there it was not gonna be a good experience the way the server approached us, and I‚Äôm thinking it was the owner, but not sure.  His mannerism was not very friendly. Another server brought our food out and he was not friendly at all, he was very abrupt, and we mentioned our experience with the washroom, and all he said was he is not the owner, and if he was the owner he would not have that problem.  We tried to use the restroom and one was completely out of order, and essentially there was another table of large group, all waiting to use one washroom.  Washroom was dirty, no toilet paper or paper towels.  The food was not that great as was previously mentioned in other reviews.  Would not go again."
Quality Donair,1,"Hi Guys! Thought id leave my 2 cents for this place. Headed over there for the 2nd time in my life and i gotta say I am not impressed with the food i was served today. The beef meat for the donair today was dryer then a desert and burnt!!! It almost seemed like they forgot to turn the roasters off last night and they didnt want to throw away the meat so they sold it to us poor saps.
The fries were over fried and i HIGHLY recommend to the owners to switch out the oil more often.
The only perks was that the indoor sitting area was clean, the cashier lady was super friendly and in the summer time they have a nice outdoor patio to eat in."
Quality Donair,5,"I would highly recommend this restaurant!
This was my first visit to Quality Donair and it won't be the lastüôÇ
The Donair is excellent and all the ingredients are fresh.
I sampled the falafel and would recommend that s well.
The staff are very welcoming and friendly.
I have to come back and try the hamburgersüòã"
Quality Donair,4,"Donairs are very good. The fries and onion rings are okay, not great. Good enough for a side dish. Definitely worth the donairs though. Been already a few times and the donairs have always been good. It may be a little bit on the pricier side but the portions are hefty so you definitely get your moneys worth. Their new location is much more customer friendly and offers more dine in options (unfortunately it‚Äôs no longer next door to where I live now hahah)"
Quality Donair,5,Food is really tasty and filling. Portion sizes are good. I had the beef donair and fries the lady behind the counter was really nice and welcoming.
Quality Donair,4,"Good food from an unassuming spot! Nothing too standout about the food but it's all cooked to order and reasonably fresh. I usually prefer my donair meat in thinner shavings rather than thicker slices, and it could be a bit more generously seasoned. Prices were mostly fair but fries and salad process were a bit high for quantity you receive. Service is very friendly."
Little Caesars (5111 22nd Street) - Red Deer,5,"Best little Ceasers ! I like getting my pizza from here at least once a week ! It‚Äôs the best . Can you guys make the pretzel pizza in other kinds than just pepperoni? I‚Äôd like to try it in Hawaiian
We love the pretzel pizza ‚Ä¶ this location is great üòä awesome staff good pizza"
Little Caesars (5111 22nd Street) - Red Deer,4,"Pizza and crazy bread was great, I‚Äôve been noticing lately that my pizza usually isn‚Äôt cut the greatest, struggled separating pieces, causing some to rip right in half.. other then that was great"
Little Caesars (5111 22nd Street) - Red Deer,4,We ordered a Hawaiian pizza and crazy bread. Then we added an order of boneless bites which were AHHH-mazing!! The pizza was great as usual. But the crazy bread... was bread... nothing real crazy about it. No garlic flavor and almost no parmesan.
Little Caesars (5111 22nd Street) - Red Deer,3,"The staff seemed to be more interested in a big phone order than the actual human, me, in the store. Took almost 10 minutes before someone spoke to me"
Little Caesars (5111 22nd Street) - Red Deer,3,"Pizza was cold from the ""hot and ready"" and was still a 15min wait with no one in line. The cheese was so minimal that you could see the sauce and crust underneath. Floor was dirty and smelling off inside üò¨

Staff member was friendly and polite."
Taco Time (Golden West Plaza),5,"We had our hot food out to us in no time, the staff were Super accommodating! Great service, kind people& clean store.. didn‚Äôt get the name of the cashier- but he definitely went over and above for our family!! Thank you!"
Taco Time (Golden West Plaza),1,"Honestly, I‚Äôve ordered various times and no matter what, my order is wrong. I keep asking for no tomatoes and I keep having tomatoes in my burrito. No one asks me what dip/sauce I want either. They assume all I want is original sauce. Every other location asks if I want hot sauce, but not this location.
They really need to step up their game. They are not worth stopping by until they improve. Go to either mall and they are 10x better."
Taco Time (Golden West Plaza),5,"Great tasting food, even better proportions, all the Hot sauce you want at no extra cost! Plus the staff came to ensure everything was as ordered and I was enjoying the meal. I will definitely be back whenever I'm in the area again."
Taco Time (Golden West Plaza),5,"For the first time ever trying any Mexican fast food alike, I was very satisfied with the quality and quantity on food In my order. I mean, my taco salad and my wife‚Äôs tacos were really loaded!! I will certainly come back to this location just because of this!!"
Taco Time (Golden West Plaza),5,"Super clean building, friendly staff! Large burrito was LARGE, and delicious, thank you~!"
BarBurrito: Alberta: Red Deer Clearview,4,"It's decent. The food taste good and service was excellent, but there is no ""wow"" factor. It doesn't seem that different from any of the other burrito stores. I would still go again however."
BarBurrito: Alberta: Red Deer Clearview,5,"I am celiac, and the careful preparation was most appreciated. The gentleman running the restaurant today also took time to explain their menu. Thank you bar burrito!"
BarBurrito: Alberta: Red Deer Clearview,5,I order every monday.  I love the food. It tastes delicious.  If something is missed they fixed it right away.  I would order from here all of the time
BarBurrito: Alberta: Red Deer Clearview,4,"Great food! Decent price! Located in Clearview Market Square, next to A&W. These guys use the freshest ingredients in their bowls and burritos! I would definitely recommend you try BarBurrito in Clearview Market Square!"
BarBurrito: Alberta: Red Deer Clearview,4,"First, definitely try the Mexican Cola, wow! Portion size to cost was on par when compared to Mucho. They definitely cover the spicy size but do have mild options. While I wasn't a fan of the Pico (mild sauce) the chips were addictive."
Pizza 73 (4912-43 Street),5,"Good food, great staff.
We ordered Spicy golden Wings loved it!"
Pizza 73 (4912-43 Street),5,"Stayed in red deer for a conference and man is this place good. I tried a different pizza place the day before and the difference is night and day. This place has great tasting crust, amazing pizza with good quality ingredients all with one low price. Highly would recommend. Manager is super nice and friendly"
Pizza 73 (4912-43 Street),1,"I had to change my review from four stars to one. Last week we ordered two pizza they were super sloppy and had Huge chunks of onions.

I said fine I will give them other chance. Once more this location managed to disappoint us again.

Improve you quality or close your store."
Pizza 73 (4912-43 Street),1,There was barely any cheese on my pizza and it was undercooked. Also the bag of Doritos expired in October‚Ä¶.2022! They were so stale yuck!! I expect better for the price I paid for this. Usually it‚Äôs ok but today it wasn‚Äôt very satisfying‚Ä¶.
Pizza 73 (4912-43 Street),5,"Great pizza, nice to see big pieces for ingredient. All the other places put meat and veggies in a blender then sprinkle it on and call it pizza. Good job, don't change"
Indian Flame & Pizza,5,"I don‚Äôt have much experience with Indian food so I don‚Äôt have much comparison, but I have to say the food was fantastic. We ordered butter chicken, mango shrimp, paneer sticks and *of course* a couple kinds of naan bread. I‚Äôd go without the paneer sticks next time, but the rest we devoured. The staff was also friendly and had my order ready quickly. I can‚Äôt wait to try other dishes :)"
Indian Flame & Pizza,3,"We ordered two dishes to go. The packaging of the containers were so bad, they were not closed properly. All the oil came out of the container. But the food was good."
Indian Flame & Pizza,1,"Just got a call from the Manager as I've complained about the food I've ordered yesterday.
Very rude, not polite.
From the start, he was like give me the food and I'll give you the money.
I said bro, chill first, be polite.
He said, I'm doing business for 30 years and so. So you didn't learn anything all these years. McDonald's employees are polite then you sir."
Indian Flame & Pizza,1,We have ordered from here for years and it has always been exceptional. Tonight sadly our experience changed. Our extra dip was forgotten. Once it arrived we sat down to eat and noticed we were missing a dish. It turns out they had substituted another dish we ordered for the one we were to get with our meal. When I called I was surprised to hear this as our bill was still $86.00 with only the additional dip and 4 buttered nann When I inquired as to the large bill we were told the menu we looked at online was old and that it was an incorrect price. I‚Äôm not sure who is responsible for updating the menu on the site but I would assume it should be the owners. My advice would be to check your bill when it arrives.
Indian Flame & Pizza,5,"Just moved to the area and ordered for the first time, online order time was accurate, staff was friendly, and the curry‚Äôs were some of the best I‚Äôve had!
A little light on the meat and the roti was slightly burnt but still delicious! Absolutely 5 stars"
Blaze Pizza (159 Leva Ave),5,"Delicious pizza, very clean restaurant, friendly and efficient staff. You really can‚Äôt ask for anything else!"
Blaze Pizza (159 Leva Ave),3,Stopped for a lunch break on our road trip last week.  Pizza was hot and made to order.  Found the toppings I selected to be a bit dry and lacking in flavor.  The sauce did not seem well seasoned.  Staff was polite and nice.
Blaze Pizza (159 Leva Ave),5,We love this place very clean and good food
Blaze Pizza (159 Leva Ave),5,Super nice staff and great pizza. Amazing customer service. They treat every customer with kindness and respect
Blaze Pizza (159 Leva Ave),5,We stop here on our way home to Edmonton.  Friendly staff. Quick efficient service. Great pizzas!
Monsieur Wongs,4,"*updated to 4 because I finally called to complain and they delivered 2 drinks in the middle of a dinner rush without me asking and were super apologetic. Hopefully they make changes to how deliveries are packaged*

Best Chinese in Red Deer but every time I order delivery they forget my drink. It's been something comical like 5 times now they've forgotten to bring the drink I ordered and I have to go through the most annoying process to get a refund."
Monsieur Wongs,1,"We were in this evening to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  The dinner for 1 was disgusting.  Spring roll dripped dark brown grease and the actual food was very greasy and disgusting.

This is the first time I've been out for a couple of years and this experience was extremely disappointing.  Paid $70.00 with the tip and food was so gross i would not even bring the leftovers home.  Bleh"
Monsieur Wongs,5,"I had a placed a large order tonite with a couple items missing. I had opted to pick up my order as I was out anyway. While arriving home realized was 2 dishes short. One call, 2 mins, not even this was rectified and the missing items delivered in a timely manner. This was above and beyond service. And the food?!! ü§§ no regrets! Highly recommend!"
Monsieur Wongs,5,"Love Monsieur Wongs!
The food is always amazing and the servers are so gracious. One of my faves for sure!"
Monsieur Wongs,1,ordered off skip and was terribly disappointed. $20 wonton soup for 2 with 4 wontons total. and it wasn‚Äôt even good. waste of money
Saro's Restaurant,5,"I love this little gem. Greeks amazing, Italians ok. I find that their pasta is over done and their garlic bread ..lol is just white bread with some garlic salt, but it's dependable and wonderful staff and pizza"
Saro's Restaurant,1,"We‚Äôd eaten there many times, and the food had been good, but the last time we were we both ordered salads......Cesar and a greek salad
The portions were fine but the amount of oil on the greek salad was an overwhelming proportion leaving a puddle of covering the entire base of the plate and producing a soggy salad that was dripping into my lap and napkin

When the waitress asked how our meals were we told her they were not good......at which point she defended both salads and the amount of oil used.
We were told by her to get out and never come back again when we disagreed with her

Interesting to note that each time we‚Äôve popped in at 6 pm for supper the restaurant was nearly empty.....we‚Äôll never ever go there again
Her loss is Boston Pizza‚Äôs gain"
Saro's Restaurant,1,"I ordered a large pizza for pickup and was told 30 mins until it's ready. Got the pizza, and it was already cold right from when I arrived. I got home and it tasted like a reheated pizza from the day before. It was my 1st and last time there ü§Æ NEVER AGAIN"
Saro's Restaurant,1,We ordered last night I ate cheese toast and chicken caesar salad and I got food poisoning been up all night sick then my fianc√© ate the other garlic toast and it had a huge chunk of mould on the bread!  Definitely do not recommend it was also expensive for mouldy bread!
Saro's Restaurant,5,Food was fantastic and big portions. Service was excellent.  Very friendly people and atmosphere.  Will definitely be back!
Pegasus 2 for 1 Pizza,3,"Top of the pizza was burned, and the pizza was dry.  Very disappointing.  We used to really like their pizza."
Pegasus 2 for 1 Pizza,1,Others may like it but we weren't fans. I don't like a thin crust. To me it tasted like cardboard. If I want pizza like that then I'll go to Little Ceasars and buy their cheap pizza.
Pegasus 2 for 1 Pizza,1,Pizza gotta be worst in town for them to close at 9pm on Friday night. Worker very rude and non helpful. Asked why there closed at 9pm on Friday night  tells me not busy after 9pm. K guys this is clear if a pizza place is not busy after 9pm on Friday. Ya font have to be a rocket scientist or math maticion to figure this one out lol
Pegasus 2 for 1 Pizza,4,"Ordered pizza.  Bit pricey for the sizes, but good. Quality ingredients, best sauce I've had outside of the family kitchen."
Pegasus 2 for 1 Pizza,5,I love their pizza  Their garlic  bread isn't great though.
Taco Bell (6889 50th Ave),1,"First time coming to taco bell red deer. Was ordering dinner for 3 people. Was super excited but ended up super disappointed. We tried to order online, but it wouldn't take payment. So then we went through the drive though, and the person taking our order didn't ask us which burritos, wraps, meats, etc, we wanted in the combos, and we ended up getting a bunch of hard tacos and bean burritos we didn't want instead of what we would have liked to order. The cinnamon twists were unedible. Super super stale and no cinnamon flavor at all. The meals weren't put together, and the tacos and wraps and burritos were unmarked, and half of them were not even in the wrapper... they were on the bottom of the bag, with nothing covering them. Even got our drinks wrong. Ended up being dinner roulette, never knowing what you're eating or getting."
Taco Bell (6889 50th Ave),1,"I would give Zero Stars if I could - Went thru the drive thru at the Red Deer location on 50 Avenue, got back to work and my Chili Cheese Fries were defiantly not Chili Cheese Fries - and since me and sour cream are not friends they went directly into the garbage."
Taco Bell (6889 50th Ave),5,"Taco Bell is a great place to have a fast meal.  Especially if one enjoys the Mexican dinner.  Spicy or not.  Tacos, burritos, Nachos, chilies cheese Fry's,  I recommend going to try a burrito or two.  Regular or supreme.  Made with  real beef and refried beans salsa cheese and sour cream.  Go to the North side Reddeer, have a dine in or takeout dinner.  Look for the KFC/TACO BELL sign this store is a two in one.  So.if you have children that don't want tacos..  they can have KFC.  In a very clean and cozy dinning room. Ho have a good fast meal. Spicy or mild. You'll LOVE IT. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Taco Bell (6889 50th Ave),1,"Food was soggy and cold, ordered ahead and had to go and wait 15 minutes in the drive thru at 740 even though the website lists the dining room open until 10:30. The whole point of ordering ahead was to not wait....."
Taco Bell (6889 50th Ave),1,"Terrible! I have never seen such sad flattened tacos with very very little filling/ toppings inside in my life! Super stingy and Portions are not worth the price! Was disappointed the first time eating from this location and figured I'd give them another go over a year later. Nope, nope, just nope! Never again! Rip off!!"
COBS Bread (Southpointe Common),1,"Very disappointing! I came at the store at 4:00
pm
and i am expecting cheese croissant that is available but it seems that they are about to close only products available in the display case which is very minimum
amount. Employees are preparing for closing but when as far as i knew they will be closing at 7:00 pm. Everything is almost empty, the ambiance is not inviting for a guest to come on this location. My excitement to come and taste the products turns to dissatisfactionüòåüòåüòå I will never come back and recommend on this bakery."
COBS Bread (Southpointe Common),5,"Always love Cobs Bread and Bakery! Was near the end of closing and the person at the till gave my daughter a free Fun Bun! Very nice of her and we will definitely be back! I forgot to buy my loaf of bread, in the midst of buying treats for the kids (and myself lol) Let's put it this way.... When my 11yr old son walks into a place and says ""it smells soooo good in here"", you know you're at a good bakery!!!"
COBS Bread (Southpointe Common),2,Yea sure they may have good bread here but if they are always sold out then what is the point of coming here? I'm tired of making the trip and them never having what I want. I won't be back anymore.
COBS Bread (Southpointe Common),5,Love the food. Always very satisfied when I go here
COBS Bread (Southpointe Common),5,The best bakery in red deer and even better employees (anya)
New York Fries (Parkland Mall Red Deer Ctr),1,Worst meal ever in my life! Wasn't hot. Had to ask for the toppings I paid for to be put on. Staff made me feel as though I was a nuisance. Place has really gone downhill.  Won't be back.
New York Fries (Parkland Mall Red Deer Ctr),5,"Had Anna as a cashier and she was welcoming and friendly. I got a small poutine, it was made quickly and tasted delicious!"
New York Fries (Parkland Mall Red Deer Ctr),1,"Won two $10 gift cards from the radio station, they wouldn‚Äôt even let me use them both and were very rude about it . Since one poutine and a drink is more than $10 they insisted I pay cash For the difference and wouldn‚Äôt take the second gift card Toward the rest of my order ... very disappointing"
New York Fries (Parkland Mall Red Deer Ctr),1,Was at New York Fries at 14:30 and the cashier at the time there was very rude to not just me but to the other customers as well.  The other woman that was with the cashier was polite but the cashier  was extremely rude to me.  I would not recommend eating here at all.  Terrible service.
New York Fries (Parkland Mall Red Deer Ctr),4,"good poutines. Add cheese and gravy throughout the entire clump of fries though, not just ontop."
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Red Deer),5,"Definitely a must try!! ü§© Enjoyed building my own burrito bowl! You get what you paid for, the food is really good! All the proteins taste so good specially when you add some guacamole and queso sauce on it! The best Mexican food! So do yourself a favor and visit quesada in Red Deer ü§©ü§©ü§©üëå"
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Red Deer),5,"One of the single greatest days of my life was when this location opened up in the South End, a mere 2 minute walk from my work place.
Fast food times, with Restaurant quality. Several house made fresh ingredients and a fantastic staff, you are definitely getting your money's worth.

And don't forget to tip!!!!"
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Red Deer),4,"Food was very tasty, the Reg. Size Burrito was a nice size, choice of topping, inhouse made sauces,and our server Mehak ( hope thats right )  was a wonderful young lady, came over and asked how everything was. Don't always get that at a fast food place."
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Red Deer),5,"Had the Thursday special burrito of the day today , spicy chicken. Store is clean, food is very fresh, not processed, chicken is real, pita is steamed and fresh and packed so full he could hardly roll it. Staff are excellent, sauces are fresh and tasty. The burrito it‚Äôs is amazing, I asked for spice and I got it. I‚Äôm glad I went there and I certainly will again, great job guys!! Traveller from Edmonton."
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Red Deer),5,This place is amazing! The manager Vivek always knows my order and is always friendly! The staff are great too! And the food tastes amazing! Highly recommend
King Donair Chicken Shawarma Mediterranean Food,5,Great customer service. The owner is super friendly and gave us a sample of the Baklava...delicious!. We had the falafel and it didn't make me falafel about that decision. It was perfect. Delicious and very enjoyable experience. Would recommend and we will be back.
King Donair Chicken Shawarma Mediterranean Food,5,"The food was delicious, the service was excellent and I couldn't have asked for a better atmosphere. I had a beef Donair because that's my favorite but I was given a sample of the chicken to try and it was equally delicious. I definitely recommend eating here."
King Donair Chicken Shawarma Mediterranean Food,1,"Came in and ordered a few donairs. The pictures inside showed mozzarella cheese on the donairs. I ordered extra cheese on both. When I got a look at him preparing it, he had put processed cheese that were single wrapped on them. I told him this is not what I was paying for and assumed it was mozzarella from his advertising. He told me it would be fine. Few minutes later I returned to work with my bosses donairs and they ended up throwing them in the garbage. I understand wanting to save money but please dont false advertise
We wont return but dont want to discourage others. The owner in really nice but please dont false advertise"
King Donair Chicken Shawarma Mediterranean Food,5,They best chicken plater in Red Deer I try many places but I found perfect king donair .old is gold thanks keep up
King Donair Chicken Shawarma Mediterranean Food,5,Very good customer service and a solid donair; will make this a regular lunch spot.
Mucho Burrito (69 Dunlop St #6),3,"It was okay. Not the best Mexican food I've ever had. But it was fine.  Atmosphere did not invite hanging around.  Even though it's mostly a take-out place, a little decor would not go amiss. Server was friendly and efficient."
Mucho Burrito (69 Dunlop St #6),1,"I went there after quite a long time and was looking forward to enjoying the meal in the restaurant. When I walked on, the place was empty (quite unusual for a weekend).

The guy appeared from behind the kitchen after a while and asked me for my order (no greeting or anything). I gave him the order but he seemed to be having trouble understanding me, just have me a blank stare. His language skills didn't seem very good.

A female also appeared and took over but she did not seem very cordial either. Neither one of them seemed enthusiastic about serving the only customer that had showed up to give them business. On the contrary, they looked bothered and inconvenienced that I was there. Its like they did not want to be there. They did not smile and just didn't care. It was very awkward.

The previous (Latino) management  were a bit better, but these new E.iŒ∑diaŒ∑ workers had a negative, and grouchy attitude. That explains why the restaurant was empty

These people are going to lose my future business as I will not be eating at this location again."
Mucho Burrito (69 Dunlop St #6),5,"I've had a wonderful experience at Mucho every time I have gone. I was just in there today and was greeted with a smile and excellent service.
I've been going to Mucho on Dunlop for years and thanks to their service and wonderful meals, I plan to return for my years more :)"
Mucho Burrito (69 Dunlop St #6),1,"Went there , usually the service is good .
He didn‚Äôt understand me , gave vegetables in my daughter burrito bowl , after I said no vegetables twice . Didn‚Äôt remake it so I had to pick them out . They usually give more rice or meat if you don‚Äôt take vegetables . He gave hardly any cheese even after we asked for more. Didn‚Äôt give the extra sauce . To top it off he burnt both burritos . Won‚Äôt go back again . Wasn‚Äôt worth the money for how little we got ."
Mucho Burrito (69 Dunlop St #6),5,Good stuff!  Restaurant is nice and clean.
McDonald's (Sherbrooke Ii),1,"The girl who served us wasn‚Äôt wearing a uniform (wearing regular street clothes), wasn‚Äôt wearing a hairnet, and was wearing earrings (which is ALL against food & safety guidelines in fast food industries). The service was slow, and they got our order wrong. Also she slammed the drive through window in our face before we could even say what was missing. Before closing the drive through window, the girl said ‚Äútous est de dans la‚Ä¶‚Äù with an annoyed tone. We were missing food items, our drinks, utensils etc‚Ä¶ over 5 errors in our order. Yikes"
McDonald's (Sherbrooke Ii),1,Every time I order a happy meal for delivery I am missing half of my order. This is a reoccurring issue I have with this specifically with this McDonald's. It sucks to have to deal with a disappointed child every time I order here because the worker(s) on the floor don't check that they completed the order properly before sending it out for delivery.
McDonald's (Sherbrooke Ii),3,"I was not impressed today,one of your workers,I think he is new ,I passed through the drive though and he couldn't talk much English, but I did hear him said he loves me ,who says that to a customer, I was pretty creeped out,I gave him a bad look and as I was driving up to the next window I saw him still looking at me and waving,this isn't very nice,I am afraid to go back to that McDonald's, and just to let you know also the woman I had at the window she was very rude,,"
McDonald's (Sherbrooke Ii),5,Love this branch. They get everything right ‚úÖÔ∏è
McDonald's (Sherbrooke Ii),1,Always check your order before leaving because they always forget something. Refused to serve me and my family anything other then breakfast because it was 10:58am and asked us to get out of the drive thru and to come back after 11am... And they have a big sign saying they are 24/24 but they are closed after 10pm. Drive 15 minutes more and go to the other one on King O. Street.
Boston Pizza (Sherbrooke),5,Great experience with my family (3 young kids)! Service was perfect and the food was great for a reasonable price. I definitely recommend it üëå
Boston Pizza (Sherbrooke),4,"The service alone was worth 5 stars. Our waitress had such a wonderful smile !

The food was alright, we were disappointed in some appetizers (fried cauliflowers had almost no sauce, same for some of our wings). The rest of the food was good."
Boston Pizza (Sherbrooke),3,"Decent food, beyond expensive for what it was but that is to be expected now a days. (80+$ for 2 salads and an entree. not including tip)
Service was acceptable but far from fabulous."
Boston Pizza (Sherbrooke),5,"Boston Pizza is the perfect place to enjoy a casual and delicious meal. The restaurant has a cozy and inviting atmosphere, with friendly staff who are always ready to help."
Boston Pizza (Sherbrooke),3,There was a live band so it got a little loud. Band wasn't bad though.
Pizza Pizza (2755 rue King Ouest),5,"I like that they have different crust options with whole wheat and cauliflower. I ordered the pizza with a whole wheat crust, and it had good taste. The price are reasonable and the amount of meat and vegetable toppings are also good. overall, the pizza tasted better than other chain restaurants. The medium pizza was heavy for two people."
Pizza Pizza (2755 rue King Ouest),3,Not expensive but I guess you get what you pay for.  The bacon strips aren‚Äôt cooked. They should at least be somewhat cooked.
Pizza Pizza (2755 rue King Ouest),2,"Look, I've ordered here before and I'd never really had any issues with it when I did, but tonight seems to have been a bad night.
First off, our food was lukewarm at best if it was cooked at all (which it mostly wasn't).
Second, i know that this apartment building isn't super easy to find, but no other delivery companies have had any trouble finding it so far and we've been here three months now. This is the first time I've had to go retrieve a driver two apartment buildings down the road.
We got all of our food, and i don't want a refund or anything, but I'm not impressed and i really don't think we'll be ordering here any time soon."
Pizza Pizza (2755 rue King Ouest),5,"Very good service. One of the Best pizzas in the town. A lot better than dominos.
Loaded with amazing toppings.
Also,the staff is very nice."
Pizza Pizza (2755 rue King Ouest),2,"After a hard week's work I decided I would treat myself to a pizza, investing $20 of my hard-earned money into what I thought was going to be the most amazing pizza ever! Well let me tell you, there was nothing amazing about that pizza! Forgetting my all-important dipping sauce!    What a huge disappointment! My favourite part about my pizza, at this point my meal is ruined. I was charged for this dipping sauce I might add. It's not about the money, it's about the customer service provided when I called to tell them of my dilemma. Offering me $2 as that was what the dipping sauce costs! The meal was awful irregardless what the cost was. I call it a blessing, pizza pizza feels my hard-earned $20 is only worth $2 to them. Time to purchase my pizza elsewhere from now on! Remember this the next time you're thinking of ordering from this establishment! Irregardless of what you pay for your meal it should be reimbursed if it's not satisfactory! That to me is outstanding customer service. You'd better hope they don't mess up your meal."
Village Grec,4,"Great pita with a huge portion of Greek chips, rice and salad. The salad dressing was also good. A great value for your money."
Village Grec,4,Fast and good. I tend to ask for half the sauce in my gyros and its one of the very best in sherbrooke.
Village Grec,3,Large portions but not the best tasting greek food. We had a chicken souvlaki and a gyro and they weren't terrible but if you love gyro and souvlaki I would not recommend this place. Chicken was a little dry and the sauce was missing garlic which is a huge part of tzatziki.
Village Grec,4,"Quality varies a lot between dishes, but most of their fancier poutines are amazing, especially the greek one. Their pasta is not to be looked over either."
Village Grec,1,"They messed up the order and wouldn‚Äôt even fix it, just denied it and wanted us to pay for a whole new one! The thing they gave us looked barely edible anyway and was not worth the price. Gave it to the dog. Terrible first impression and will find Greek food somewhere better next time."
D√©gustateurs Cantine Moderne,5,One of my favourite places in Sherbrooke! A must if you are in Fleurimont. I highly recommend the margarita pizza and the tex Mex burger.
D√©gustateurs Cantine Moderne,5,Our favorite place! The best hamburguers!!
D√©gustateurs Cantine Moderne,5,Nice decent restaurant. Delicious homey meals. Very very good service. Delicious food beautiful presentation.
D√©gustateurs Cantine Moderne,5,Best poutine in sherbrooke
D√©gustateurs Cantine Moderne,5,Best Poutine ever! 24 choices!!! Better than La Banquise (mtl) !!!!
Pizza Avenue (Fleurimont),5,I ordered on site and great value when you use the specials. Good pizza
Pizza Avenue (Fleurimont),5,I am an Uber driver and have never had a bad experience here. Great staff and awesome smelling food.
Pizza Avenue (Fleurimont),5,It's the best place with the best pizza in sherbrooke
Pizza Avenue (Fleurimont),5,"I just ordered through doordash and wow the pizza is amazing. The sauce is amazing, great amount of veggies, cheese is perfect and the dough is very good. Just visiting Sherbrooke for couple months but will be ordering from here everytime. They also followed my instructions :) Thank you"
Pizza Avenue (Fleurimont),5,"Ordered via Uber Eats from a hotel, which I do quite often now that COVID is keeping us out of the restaurants.

This is the first time I've ordered from Pizza Avenue, and also the first time I received the utensils I asked for (from a pizza place). In addition, they even included a plate. The pizza was fantastic as well as the Greek salad. Will definitely be ordering from them again."
Da Toni Pronto,5,Great fresh Italian food
Da Toni Pronto,5,Ch√®vre Florentine is my favorite plate here. I always come for a Datoni Pronto when I visit Sherbrooke.
Da Toni Pronto,5,"Very affordable price for the quality, friendly staff, strongly recommend."
Da Toni Pronto,4,Quick pasta and pizza. Only 3 seats at a small bar are available for seating.
Da Toni Pronto,5,High quality take-out. Mainly serves pizzas and pasta
Principe Pizza-Pasta,5,"Woow, what a tasty pizza !
I am in Sherbrooke for our new branch opening for three weeks,
This evening I discovered this place , I feel like I am having pizza in Rome or Milano or in a Reggio Calabria.
Honestly delicious ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you for this manifiques supper"
Principe Pizza-Pasta,5,"Awesome pizza place, the fire oven and fresh ingredients make all the difference! Very welcoming staff aswell, highly recommend :)"
Principe Pizza-Pasta,5,"J'ai mang√©  avec ma petite famille de la pizza cuite en bois et du pasta aujourd'hui. C'√©tait un d√©lice. Le restaurant est propre, le personnel √©tait tr√®s accueillant et gentil. Un restaurant sympa √† visiter √† Sherbrooke."
Principe Pizza-Pasta,2,"This was by far our favorite restaurant in Sherbrooke. Unbeatable value for money. Also, being Italian, I am a critic on the pizza and this one is delicious.

Now, a few months ago, the restaurant took a turn for the worse. The portions have decreased, we are no longer served on plates, but on sheet metal with paper on top and the metal utensils have been removed.

We went there every week, but it became too bad to pay the same price without being able to be satisfied.

I spoke to the staff the last time we were there and they told me that we weren't the only regulars dissatisfied with the changes."
Principe Pizza-Pasta,3,"Excellent food and new and interesting concept, good music and general atmosphere. For that, it deserves a 5 * even if only 1 employee out of the 3 was friendly and welcoming
(it seemed to be the manager).

On the other hand, the level of cleanliness of the restaurant really makes no sense, even though there were 3 employees behind the counter and there was no one in the restaurant except us. For example, I must mention the dirty windowsills, the banquettes with dead insects and stains, the floor that has not been cleaned for ages, not to mention the drink machine and the toilets with dirty and stained walls as well as the sink, faucet etc. Cleaning is clearly not a daily task.

I really hope that a correction will be made on this subject, it is still a place where we eat!!! Without that, I'm not going back."
Bistro Belv√©d√®re,2,"Going into the restaurant the food is alot better when ordered but maybe it's to do with the cook. (20th of Dec at 3am poutine was amazing)
But when you order using uber/doordash ( Jan 11 6pm) - they seem to use old fries. And do not mix the sauce from the bottom up and stir before pouring the sauce onto the poutine. When you don't stir the sauce the poutine is cold regardless of how many times the fries were put in the deep fryer.
You need to see steam coming from the pot.
On top of this. Be careful ordering using doordash-skip and uber. The prices DONOT match for ""pick up at restaurant"" each app had a different price."
Bistro Belv√©d√®re,5,"Best place to get food! Open 24/7!!
The poutines are awesome service is great!"
Bistro Belv√©d√®re,1,"Aweful Salad and lack of hygiene, I found hair on it and I had to throw the entire meal"
Bistro Belv√©d√®re,4,The only 24 hours restaurant in Sherbrooke
Bistro Belv√©d√®re,1,"Didn't get full order, was very expensive and food was sub-par.  Cold overcooked fries."
Pizza Salvator√© (Sherbrooke Est),5,"The vegetarian pizza was amazing and full of fresh veggies.
The All Dressed had plenty of green peppers and just the right amount of pepperoni.
Even after sitting in the fridge over night, the leftovers look great!"
Pizza Salvator√© (Sherbrooke Est),1,"By far the worst pizza I've ever had, I didn't realize pizza could taste this awful. The crust tastes like actual cardboard, there's barely if any sauce at all. I couldn't get myself to actually eat it after forcing myself to eat two bites.
The poutine was okay, though a bit small. The fries had a weird internal texture, but the gravy and curds were at least good."
Pizza Salvator√© (Sherbrooke Est),5,"It isn‚Äôt always the easiest finding food at late hours in Sherbrooke - but this place doesn‚Äôt disappoint ! A big thank you to Jesse who was working that evening and gave us outstanding service. He was kind, cordial, spoke English with us (even though he doesn‚Äôt have to) and he was just so incredibly diligent about the timing of our order.

Honestly - living in Montreal, and coming to Sherbrooke and being served with such politeness was such a refreshing change and we just want to thank Jesse again for his wonderful service.

We got buffalo chicken wings, pepperoni pizza and some curly fries for late night eats. Only downside was that we got a chicken wing that was raw inside, just a heads up !"
Pizza Salvator√© (Sherbrooke Est),4,Great pizza! Four stars because they don‚Äôt deliver to my neighbourhood even though it‚Äôs only a ten minute drive (5.5 km).
Pizza Salvator√© (Sherbrooke Est),5,"Always love to buy a pizza and french fries love them so much it is delicious ans the employees are so cool and nice! I will recommand to anybody how it is sooooo goooodddd!
Continue the great work you guys!!!"
Brad's Gourmet,1,"They ran out of dough around 5pm so we had to buy from the leftover fridge. Pizza was ok but nothing special. The dough is very yeasty which overpowers all the other flavors. We felt a lot of selling pressure to buy stuff we didn't need or want. That needs to be toned down a couple of notches. At the end, we were also asked whether or not we go to church, which is very unprofessional and should not be part of a normal customer service interaction. Won't be going back."
Brad's Gourmet,5,Super friendly staff! Gabrielle was helpful choosing vegetarian pizza options (the Augustino is delish)! And i highly recommend their sweet snacks!
Brad's Gourmet,5,"Amazing service, super kind and warmly welcomed me and my 6 friends on a pizza night.  Brad‚Äôs store goods are made up of yummy in house dough mixes and beautiful products from local vendors. Awesome to have such a stellar small business around. Highly recommend for date nights and fellow hungry Uni students!"
Brad's Gourmet,5,"I really like the atmosphere, the bbq pulled pork pizza is very good

Also very good customer service

For a homemade pizza dough, and made to order pizzas, the prices are very reasonable"
Brad's Gourmet,5,Amazing.  Best pizza around. Love it. Brad is great. Very friendly.  And you can ship his dough home to make your own pizzas!!!
Coco Frutti (Sherbrooke-Belv√©d√®re),4,"This is a pretty good breakfast chain in town. The decor is classy and I love that they give you a whole pot of coffee to keep on your table. The food was good with big portions and fresh fruit. Our server was really nice except she was too busy to really check in often, but you could tell she had a lot of tables on the go, so we understood. Overall a good breakfast!"
Coco Frutti (Sherbrooke-Belv√©d√®re),4,"The food was great like always, and the service was excellent. It didn't take long for us to eat after we ordered even though there was a lot of people."
Coco Frutti (Sherbrooke-Belv√©d√®re),3,"The meal was already expensive (ordered eggs Benedict and paid extra to get a side of bacon) and then they charged me extra for a packet of cream cheese, and extra for a take out container to take my leftovers home. By the end it was over $30.00 for my breakfast. Won't go here on a regular basis with all of these additional charges."
Coco Frutti (Sherbrooke-Belv√©d√®re),5,They were so efficient and staff was so friendly. Would definitely go back
Coco Frutti (Sherbrooke-Belv√©d√®re),5,Good place. It's not fancy but it's not supposed to be either. It's a great diner brunch place. Service was very good. Also very quick to serve the food without rushing you out. Price is decent as well. Highly recommend if it's the type of brunch you're looking for.
St-Hubert (Fleurimont),4,"UPDATE: Feb 8th 2023
I was VERY surprised to have a reply here for St Hubert asking to contact them about my experience.

The local manager contacted me and apologized for the situation. While I was not initially happy with what happened, I am impressed with St Hubert's ability to make the situation right.

I have changed my review from a 1 all the way around to a 4 for great customer service after the fact. Thank You

-------------------------

Original Review January 29,2023
Wow What a rip off. 18$ for this poutine. It had very little cheese. Was cold and not edible."
St-Hubert (Fleurimont),1,"I love this restaurant but today it was worse,  I went to pick uber food delivery for a customer at around 9PM today but I waited for over 30 min no one could even talk to me about what is happening only the ignorant  lady who was just moving in the restaurant without caring on customers I was shocked and I canceled the delivery."
St-Hubert (Fleurimont),5,As good a St-Hubert express as any. It was not busy and we had our food quickly.
St-Hubert (Fleurimont),2,"Ordered food online around 3 pm for a 6:45 pm delivery. Food arrived 7:15 pm, lukewarm. Brought it up with delivery guy who said it wasn't his fault, they were overwhelmed. According to the ticket, the order was prepared at 6:16 pm., so arrived an hour after it was prepared. St-Hubert Express?"
St-Hubert (Fleurimont),1,Ordered at 610 says out for delivery at 630 ...its now 815 still no food but my confirmation says delivered ...called st.hub says driver went to wrong address so now i have to wait for another order that will arrive by 9pm ...ridiculous
Poulet Poulet (2755 rue King Ouest),5,"I like that they have different crust options with whole wheat and cauliflower. I ordered the pizza with a whole wheat crust, and it had good taste. The price are reasonable and the amount of meat and vegetable toppings are also good. overall, the pizza tasted better than other chain restaurants. The medium pizza was heavy for two people."
Poulet Poulet (2755 rue King Ouest),3,Not expensive but I guess you get what you pay for.  The bacon strips aren‚Äôt cooked. They should at least be somewhat cooked.
Poulet Poulet (2755 rue King Ouest),2,"Look, I've ordered here before and I'd never really had any issues with it when I did, but tonight seems to have been a bad night.
First off, our food was lukewarm at best if it was cooked at all (which it mostly wasn't).
Second, i know that this apartment building isn't super easy to find, but no other delivery companies have had any trouble finding it so far and we've been here three months now. This is the first time I've had to go retrieve a driver two apartment buildings down the road.
We got all of our food, and i don't want a refund or anything, but I'm not impressed and i really don't think we'll be ordering here any time soon."
Poulet Poulet (2755 rue King Ouest),5,"Very good service. One of the Best pizzas in the town. A lot better than dominos.
Loaded with amazing toppings.
Also,the staff is very nice."
Poulet Poulet (2755 rue King Ouest),2,"After a hard week's work I decided I would treat myself to a pizza, investing $20 of my hard-earned money into what I thought was going to be the most amazing pizza ever! Well let me tell you, there was nothing amazing about that pizza! Forgetting my all-important dipping sauce!    What a huge disappointment! My favourite part about my pizza, at this point my meal is ruined. I was charged for this dipping sauce I might add. It's not about the money, it's about the customer service provided when I called to tell them of my dilemma. Offering me $2 as that was what the dipping sauce costs! The meal was awful irregardless what the cost was. I call it a blessing, pizza pizza feels my hard-earned $20 is only worth $2 to them. Time to purchase my pizza elsewhere from now on! Remember this the next time you're thinking of ordering from this establishment! Irregardless of what you pay for your meal it should be reimbursed if it's not satisfactory! That to me is outstanding customer service. You'd better hope they don't mess up your meal."
Cora (3200 B rue King Ouest Suite B180),5,"Nice friendly staff, and good food.
Waitress was attentive and fast.
If you pass by Sherbrooke, it's a good choice to give it a try for a good breakfast.
You will get a good enough portion of food and fruits. And their smoothie is delicious."
Cora (3200 B rue King Ouest Suite B180),5,"One of the better breakfast places in Sherbrooke. There is a view on the river, service was fast and food came hot and delicious. Presentation is also top notch and the prices are decent too."
Cora (3200 B rue King Ouest Suite B180),4,One of the finest Cora‚Äôs I‚Äôve tried. Plus the outdoor patio offers a great view of the water.
Cora (3200 B rue King Ouest Suite B180),1,"Placed an order through doordash due to covid 19. Asked for well done eggs bene, received them and they disgustingly runny barely cooked. The food was thrown together and not very appealing.  The sauce was nothing like hollandaise should taste. Also ordered a waffle plate with fruit..  removed the fruit in big pieces had to cut them all down. Very disappointed as at the restaurant it was usually very good. Never going to be ordering from here for delivery again!!"
Cora (3200 B rue King Ouest Suite B180),2,"Pretty disappointing as far as Coras go. Usually there is a certain experience offered but not at this location.
Food was so cold I had to ask for it to be microwaved. Less than half the fruit that we normally receive at other locations. Coffee never refilled and once our meal was brought the waiter disappeared and never came back."
Ben & Florentine (2015 12 ave N.),1,"I‚Äôm from out of town and i came to eat here with friends for breakfast-  We waited for service for an hour and our food took even longer. The food finally came and the eggs were watery and some of the food was cold, terrible. I got the breakfast poutine that didn‚Äôt say there was tomatoes in it to share with my boyfriend and there were 1-2 tomatoes inside when my boyfriend is allergic‚Ä¶. The waitress was nice but it took way too long so the experience was ruined."
Ben & Florentine (2015 12 ave N.),3,"Food was great, service was good. Son asked for gluten free bread and it came in a basket touching 'regular' bread. Something to keep in mind if you are celiac like my son is. Cross contamination is serious and should be mentioned/taught to servers and kitchen staff."
Ben & Florentine (2015 12 ave N.),1,"Literally waited 30 minutes to get served and then another 1:15h to get the food. On top of it the food wasn‚Äôt even good. People that came after us were served, fed and left before we even got our food. Literally horrible, go to Tims."
Ben & Florentine (2015 12 ave N.),4,"The food is good, but the service is slow. Not sure if the cooks are slow, but the wait staff definitely isn't in a rush. Although we always had our coffee cups full."
Ben & Florentine (2015 12 ave N.),1,"Food is cold, Benedict eggs were overcooked (No runny yolk), portions are really small for the price ans there's much better restaurant around."
La Cage (Sherbrooke),5,"Great, modern sports bar and restaurant. Friendly, professional staff. The food was delicious. I was impressed at how quickly our meals came out while the restaurant was almost at capacity. It‚Äôs definitely on the pricier side for what you get - but factoring in all of the above - 5 stars."
La Cage (Sherbrooke),2,Well where does one start! I get seated real fast with the traditional popcorn basket. I scan the QR code for the menu and almost before the menu is up the waiter comes over to see what I want to eat and drink. I ask him to come back as I want to see what I am in for before choosing a drink. Now 5 minutes at least go by and I am almost done with the popcorn and he still has his back to me and talking to the same 2 customers that originally he was talking too when I walked in. 5 more minutes go by and now I ask the other barmaid to see if she can help me out. She tells me I need to speak to my waiter yet he seems uninterested in coming over as I have waved at least 5 times for service. She disturbs him and he now comes over for my order an old fashion ( made way too sweet ) and ribs with fries and rice. Food has now been served and the fries and rice are fine but the ribs definitely not fall off the bone. Very chewy almost not eatable. Btw the water bottle served was literally sink water and luke warm at best. I had to get his attention again so I could get some ice in a glass what a disaster this place is!
La Cage (Sherbrooke),5,"One of the best burger places in Sherbrooke!
Do you like free popcorn üçøyou‚Äôll be served for free a basket of popcorn!
The place is nice, clean, and huge.
Servers are super helpful and always available when needed.
I got BLITZ BURGER and it was small but tasty. The fries were a bit burned but it wasn‚Äôt that bad.
Overall recommended"
La Cage (Sherbrooke),5,"Very nice sports bar. Their food was very good, loved their appatizers wings and veggie bowl. Our watress was very nice and attentive. We had a large party of 14 yet she was great on checking in on all of us. I ordered their beyond burger and it was good. I thought it could have been seasoned a little more but that might be just me. My friend ordered the same thing and she loved it.  We had great drinks and fun.
The only thing I want to point out is that they have one bathroom for both genders. This threw me off a little when I walked in and saw a guy. There are multiple stalls so it was fine, just wish there was a sign to warn you first. While I was washing my hands another man walked in and had the same surprise face that I had. he only spoke French and I only spoke English yet we totally understood each other and had a good laugh about it..very funny!"
La Cage (Sherbrooke),1,"It‚Äôs was so disappointing. Service was fine. They messed up our order but that happens and it was rectified. But the burger with goat cheese was meh and I‚Äôm being generous. The fries! Gross! And we are in Quebec. Best province to get fries. But Le Cage was horrible. My partner had chicken in her salad. It was itty bitty. Yikes. Not great for the price either. Have sports but music blaring. Oh my goodness the bill arrived and I thought I ordered a special but you have to be a member to get the special. Also we order desert, pudding chomeur ! It was the worst and I mean the worst pudding Chomeur I‚Äôve ever had. Sigh. Disappointing."
Rest-O-Parc Belv√©d√®re,1,"Unpleased with the amount it costs for the quality of food. For example today I went to buy a magic potion, it was not what i was expecting, there was very little slush, too much ice cream, there was no candy in it and when we asked if they're was supposed to be candy the man serving us said yes, and gave us three pieces of candy in a napkin. Not planning on going back anytime soon."
Rest-O-Parc Belv√©d√®re,5,üî•üî•üî•
Rest-O-Parc Belv√©d√®re,5,Wow I had the regular poutine and I have to say their fries are ~bussin'~. They are seasoned to perfection! I highly recommend
Rest-O-Parc Belv√©d√®re,5,"Best breakfast poutine in the world!!!
Hollandaise sauce ü§§ü§§ü§§
With real poutine cheese."
Rest-O-Parc Belv√©d√®re,5,The rolls are simply delicious! Poutine too!
Le Snack Poutines,1,"I went for dining in on July 13th, 2023. The person who was taking my customized order was charging me for adding some ingredients. So, I decided to cancel and order something else. When I said, I wanna cancel that and order something else from the menu before even paying or they didn't even start making my Poutine, the gentlemen rudely said, ""that's the price and they can't change it."" Forced me to pay for something I wasn't interested for. I politely said, sorry I don't want that and was walking out because he didn't want to change the order. He said, you are not the best customer. I wished him good luck and walked out. Hope my review will help others."
Le Snack Poutines,5,"Really tasty poutine, welcoming staff. All in all it is a good place to have your fix of poutine with friends or alone on the go or eat it on the spot. The manager was kind and cheerful. Highly recommend the LeSnack Poutines if you are avid to discover the far too many flavours of poutine that are offered."
Le Snack Poutines,2,"I‚Äôll give it one star just because people there were nice
I am sorry for saying that, but three years ago the food were amazing
But now..
They only offer takeout food
Their poutine doesn‚Äôt look delicious, also the food presenting doesn‚Äôt seem nice
My friend and I, we had a stomach pain after eating it.. also it wasn‚Äôt so tasty. They barley added cheese.."
Le Snack Poutines,5,First time in Quebec and I knew I had to get Poutine. Everyone recommended here and my god I am happy that I went here. So many different types and legit all the ones I tried were amazing!! Don't quite remember what my pictured one is called but it was the one with the most meat. 10/10 recommend!!
Le Snack Poutines,4,"Came here with friends on the way up from Maine! I really appreciated how there was no one else in the restaurant at 3 pm on Sunday so we didn‚Äôt have to wait a long time!

Food: we got the Le Snack and the Le Fontaine poutine medium sized and the amount of food was perfect for 4 not too hungry girls! We really liked how the fries were seasoned since it wasn‚Äôt too heavy even though there was lots of cheese.

Service: The waiters here were nice and spoke English and French! Food came out quickly and you can watch them make your food.

Ambiance: Super casual place.

Overall, super quick and relatively cheap poutine that‚Äôs good for a quick stop!"
Pacini (Sherbrooke),3,"Not the first time at this restaurant, but probably the last.  Service was mediocre. We asked to substitute Parmesan fries instead of pasta (and was told they don't do substitution)which we have done in the past. Food -was not hot, grilled vegetables were still raw and cold. The pasta was lukewarm and bland . The waitress didn't even come back to the table for twenty minutes.  At that point why bother saying anything. The best part of the meal was the pizza.  At least they got that right."
Pacini (Sherbrooke),3,"We waited over 20 minutes for a waiter to come and take our order. What saved it was how friendly our waiter was. She was respectful and attentive, and she made sure we had a good experience after waiting so much.

The food was okay, we ordered the feast for two and the steak needed salt. The kids' pizza was really good. Some of the deserts were overly sweet for my taste.

We had a good time, and the kids lived the bread station. If you are looking for a nice place to sit down to eat, that is kid's friendly, I say give it a go."
Pacini (Sherbrooke),4,"The restaurant is very authentic, super nice atmosphere. Food is very delicious, but you have to wait a bit long for the food, if you go there when it is crowded. Still recommend it."
Pacini (Sherbrooke),2,"Very long service, not really nice. Expensive for what it is. Service was so bad, she forgot us at the table, we wait 30 min only to have the receipt and pay."
Pacini (Sherbrooke),4,"Good food and wine. The attendants were well prepared but sometimes they left the customers alone. Too much food served for 1 portion, I don't like to waste food. Nice environment."
Harvey's (Rue King O),3,"It's all about the meat. Just not a fan of their beef patties, they taste like some gelatinous substance. Haven't tried the chicken, hopefully it's better. At least the fries were hot and the staff at this location was friendly."
Harvey's (Rue King O),5,"Excellent service, very clean, hamburgers are good, they serve a lot of patatas with Trio package (Poulet grill√© est √† 10 cnd)."
Harvey's (Rue King O),5,Parfait! The best fast food chain!!
Harvey's (Rue King O),3,Not always clean. Workers speak among themselves even if they see you waiting to be served. Food not always hot.
Harvey's (Rue King O),5,"I love this place. They're bilingual, Fast, trained very well and always make the right order. Never a mistake I go here often. Thanks!"
Subway (2110 King Est),4,Good food and nice staff.
Subway (2110 King Est),3,Food is ok and price too.
Subway (2110 King Est),3,The food quality was .. ok
Subway (2110 King Est),5,Super service üëçüëå
Subway (2110 King Est),5,Great
D√©panneur OhDep!,5,Best Dep in the city! They have everything you could need all in one place! Feeling hungry???? They have the most delicious burgers. Thank you to the staff for always giving me great service.
D√©panneur OhDep!,5,"I was impressed by the cleanliness and the variety and quality of the products you offer. It's clear that you take great pride in your business, and that dedication is reflected in the high level of customer service you provide. I really recommend it to other's as well."
D√©panneur OhDep!,5,Great food and great service definitely will go back to this convenience store. Cheap price as well
D√©panneur OhDep!,1,Service violent
D√©panneur OhDep!,5,"One of the best burgers I've ever eaten really impressive, especially the owner who and really generous he gave us extras without charging us! Beautiful team! I will return for sure!

Strongly recommended!"
Coq-O-Bec Sherbrooke,5,I love ordering from here because you get a huge portion for a good price. I paid 20$ and got a club brown meat and poutine!
Coq-O-Bec Sherbrooke,5,Hot delicious food. Fast and ready to eat. Love this location especially because of the employees working. So cooperative and they provide a lovely place to feed my family with the best prices and great portions. Their poutine is a fan favourite in our family. Definitely recommend this place to others.
Coq-O-Bec Sherbrooke,5,"Such a great place honestly i think this is the best poutine i had in sherbrooke.
Specially if you like regular poutine this is the best place to go
Great service and the place is clean and the people are friendly"
Coq-O-Bec Sherbrooke,5,Best poutine in the province! Great service and amazing price. Will be coming soon again. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a great priced meal!
Coq-O-Bec Sherbrooke,5,Loved the costumer service as well as the food. Clean and friendly environment! Great prices as well. Best stop in Sherbrooke.
Eggsquis (Sherbrooke Portland),4,"Food is always very good!
The service is normally good but I waited quite a long last time because the waiter told me he thought I was waiting for someone...this happened a few times because I sit by myself."
Eggsquis (Sherbrooke Portland),5,"Fast service, super management, good prices meals."
Eggsquis (Sherbrooke Portland),2,"At first, customer service was amazing. The server recommended the French Vanilla. It was so good (better than Tim Horton‚Äôs). I got bacon apple and caramel waffle. I didn‚Äôt like the texture of the waffle. In fact, it became soggy with the caramel. The caramel was excellent tough. At the end, my server forgot about me. I asked for him twice to another server. I had to stand at the cashier for him to come and give me my bill..."
Eggsquis (Sherbrooke Portland),5,Bathrooms were very clean!  Food was delicious  and plenty of it!
Eggsquis (Sherbrooke Portland),2,"Went this morning for an early brunch, was very underwhelmed by the service. The waitress appeared was rude and inattentive. The food was decent however there was a hair in my crepe and the waitress only offered a 10% discount. After an argument with the manager the plate was compensated completely, however I would not recommend this restaurant."
KFC (736 Rue King East),1,"The Indian owner from India said, ""We don't like black people"". He said this to a black customer as I was standing in line. The customer had asked for his money back after changing his mind, prior to receiving his meal. I was confused. Did he mean that he and the white employees in the store, ""don't like black people"", or he and Indians from India ""don't like black people""?"
KFC (736 Rue King East),1,Terrible service i asked for chicken sandwich they gave me the sandwich without the chicken
KFC (736 Rue King East),1,"Ordered on Uber, drove 15 minutes to the store, had to wait another 20 in store.. pathetic."
KFC (736 Rue King East),1,VERY VERY slow service. Took over 10 minutes for popcorn chicken when im first in line. UNPROFESSIONAL  CASHIERS.
KFC (736 Rue King East),1,"Awful service, long delays and errors."
Louis Luncheonette (Centre-ville),3,"The poutine was tasty: fries were crisp, curds were fresh and squeaky, but there was way too much gravy.  I‚Äôll update the review if I come back and the experience is different"
Louis Luncheonette (Centre-ville),5,"Great local chain ! The staff members are very helpful and the portions were sizable ! Of course, it tasted amazing."
Louis Luncheonette (Centre-ville),4,"Very good food. That's why I love Louis Restaurants.  I bought chicken wings and french fries. The last time I went there was more than 12 months ago. The price of the usual food I buy over there almost doubled and I was not happy about it. But, there was plenty food in the take out and I could eat it throughout the afternoon and evening ."
Louis Luncheonette (Centre-ville),3,"Nice food and the place is clean.

It‚Äôs tasty and affordable. Nicer fast food."
Louis Luncheonette (Centre-ville),3,The decor and feel of the place is very old school. The food is no frills and nothing farted around with. Sadly this also leaves a lot to be desired in terms of taste. It's fairly average fast food served cafeteria style. Great for going to grab a bite on a budget but nothing revolutionary or noteworthy. Overall this place is average and not particularly unique.
Grillades Torino (Carrefour de l'Estrie),5,"Wow food this good in a food court, yes please.
My wife and i were extremely pleased at how good the food was, chicken cooked right in front of you and juicy not dry. The sausages were not fatty and delicious. Recommend to anyone don't hesitate.
Service was great too, nice smiles and friendly attitude from the whole team"
Grillades Torino (Carrefour de l'Estrie),5,"well greeted by the staff. The chicken meals come with added three choices of either different salad options, potatoes, mac n cheese, different rice options and half pita bread. The chicken was delicious and comes in a good portion with decent price. The meal come with humus and garlic sauce."
Grillades Torino (Carrefour de l'Estrie),5,"My favorite!! It‚Äôs halal and delicious!!
My recommendation: the chicken grill"
Grillades Torino (Carrefour de l'Estrie),5,"Every time I go to  Carrefour de l'Estrie I have to go to grillade Torino  reminds me a little the food from my country, Brasil.,üòçüòçüòç"
Grillades Torino (Carrefour de l'Estrie),5,"Fun and friendly staff! Food is delicious, especially the potatoes !!"
Au Coin du Vietnam,2,"Placed order through UberEats and arrived in less than 30 minutes.

My grilled meat was 2 pieces cheap beef steak hard, not marinated and very dry. The fried rice wasn't really fried... no crispiness and full of soy sauce and fish sauce. The vegetables were alright.

The meal came with a salad (shredded lettuce, carrots and cabbage... no vinaigrette as far as I could tell) and 2 imperial rolls. I replaced the rolls for a shrimp donut that was tasty. In the meal box was a slice of lime and very liquid sweet chili sauce (or maybe something else) but it had almost no flavor so I didn't use it.

I also ordered the spring roll, which I thought was pretty expensive and it turns out it was... that roll had almost no meat in it... like 5g of pork and 3 small shrimps and the peanut sauce that came with it had no peanut flavors, I'm not even sure what I ate to be honest.

It was edible, hence why I gave it 2 stars but I can make a better fried rice at home and grilled some decent piece of beef for 30$.
The fried rice, meat and vegetables were supposed to be aromatized with lemongrass but I barely tasted it, they probably used dry lemongrass seasoning, which has almost no flavor..

Overall, not a great experience for the price and I'm a fan of Thai cuisine, I cook a lot of Thai dishes at home and that was just not it. Opening the box and seeing 2 piece of 1$ steak was a great disappointment."
Au Coin du Vietnam,4,"Upon recommendation, my French friend and I ventured into this Vietnamese eatery. First of all, do not be put off by the location (Galt near the UdeS) and shabby building exterior, what lies within is what counts! Second, BYOB and reservations are recommended on a Friday night. Third, if you want a romantic dinner date, forget Au Coin; this restaurant is filled with a very raucous Quebecois clientele. It's hard to hear.

We were greeted at the door by a excellent host who informed us about the wait which was shortened to 30 minutes from an hour somehow miraculously!

The dining area is small, but is decorated with charming pictures, fans and an assortment of Asian items giving the place an authentic feel. Now, let's talk food! I ordered a curried coconut seafood soup and my companion ordered the Pad Thai. The meals were excellent on both counts and reasonably priced (for these days).

Take out is popular and there are some refrigerated items for sale."
Au Coin du Vietnam,5,"We stayed overnight in Sherbrooke on the way from Boston to Quebec. We found this restaurant, thanks to this site, and went there with the kids . The service was excellent, the food was excellent. The waitress overheard us speaking in English and asked us if we wanted a menu in English. Very friendly. We all speak French, which helped a lot."
Au Coin du Vietnam,1,"NEVER EVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE, IT GAVE MY ROOMMATE FOOD POISONING. She has been throwing up for 24 hours non stop. She ordered the pad Thai and egg rolls, NEVER AGAIN."
Au Coin du Vietnam,5,One of the best restaurants in town! An exceptional service and tasty food
Benny&Co (Sherbrooke),4,"The rating is based on the great food, parking and location. Unfortunately, the staff is not very friendly (rude, did not provide answers, no greeting, upset about the tip, etc.)."
Benny&Co (Sherbrooke),3,"Closing their internet order at 7:30pm because they are running out of chicken.... Calling and being told you have to go at their drive through or at the restaurant to place the order they won't do it over the phone...

Might want to rethink that process and just cook more chicken. ü§îüò¨ Or at least accept to prepare an order over the phone if we bother calling in..."
Benny&Co (Sherbrooke),4,"The soft drink machine is a mess with so many options not available (things as basic as Orange crush and Soda cream) and a touch screen that doesn't work half the time, but beside that it was good."
Benny&Co (Sherbrooke),5,"Have been to  Benny's a few times now and we LOVE it. So much better than any other chicken place. Chicken is so tender, tasty, fresh and hot. Service is very good too. Restaurant is clean and a lot of space. Thanks for being there!!!"
Benny&Co (Sherbrooke),4,"Food was decent, the chicken burger was just a couple of chicken tenders and a bun. Fries were great. Menu was not available in English, but one of the staff spokeEnglish, while the person that originally started to take our order did not."
Yuzu Sushi (1830 Rue King Ouest),4,"Despite the fact that the food took about 40 minutes to prepare, I appreciated them informing us beforehand. The salmon was fresh and the taste was really good."
Yuzu Sushi (1830 Rue King Ouest),1,"No offense, you got some good stuff, but the portions have progressively gotten smaller. I felt sick twice after eating your sashimi. And you forgot items from my order more than once, for which I‚Äôve never gotten my money back. Otherwise, great job."
Yuzu Sushi (1830 Rue King Ouest),2,"Salmon was still frozen  ! Really ?  A lot of cheap rice. Almost Tasteless . Really bad. Will not give 1 star as service was fast and courteous. Spicy mayo was ok, at least. Verdict : do not try and waste your money."
Yuzu Sushi (1830 Rue King Ouest),2,"Got 22 pieces and only 5 were edible. The rice was so old and so bad. Highly disappointed. Better sushi can be found at a gas station.

Edit: also, the email they give to send in comments doesn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶ so.. the reply that looks professional actually seems to just be a way to make things LOOK dealt with.."
Yuzu Sushi (1830 Rue King Ouest),2,"Not recommend. Ordered onlineÔºåtook 80 mins for delivery, and missing drinks, soy, won't order ever."
M. Souvlaki (Carrefour de l'Estrie),1,"Today June 30th 2022 I visited for lunch.  Absolutely disgusting,  they don't replenish salad.  There greek salad had no cheese, sliced olives not whole, lettuce was old aswell as cucumbers.  No potatoes, (French fries)  Someone from head office needs to look at the despicable food they are serving.  mine went in the garbage.  I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemies.  they put hot fries on top of there already wilted salad.  This is not right!!!!!!"
M. Souvlaki (Carrefour de l'Estrie),2,"Very expensive for what looks and tastes like cheap stuff they bought at the grocery store next door.  Bagged mixed salad, tasteless white rice with two or three peas in it, frozen and mushy spanakopita, and ""Greek"" poutine that's just regular poutine with McCain fries... all that for a whopping 20$ and served by someone who struggles to speak French... and not because they're Greek.  There's half a dozen better restaurants in the same room, go to one of 'em"
M. Souvlaki (Carrefour de l'Estrie),5,"Delicious chicken gyro for 12,99$. It can be sufficient for two."
M. Souvlaki (Carrefour de l'Estrie),5,Need to know
M. Souvlaki (Carrefour de l'Estrie),2,"Normally it is one of my favorite restaurant in the malls. However, this one is far from it.
- Portion much too small
- tasteless house dressing
- Undercooked potato
- etc."
PizzBox (St-√âlie),5,"One of the best fast food pizzas in Sherbrooke. Nice service, quick, and pretty delicious.

Their American pizza is really good, but basically anything on there tastes super fresh and their ice tea is free refills."
PizzBox (St-√âlie),5,"Excellent variety, freshness of the vegetables, super fast service and very friendly.
And good way to recycle the box is to bring it back and get a .25$ discount.
Good for thinking  of this environmentüëç
This is the Philly pizz, excellent"
PizzBox (St-√âlie),5,"Made the right choice having pizza in this location. We ordered La Philly (steak pieces)  La Parma (prosciutto, topped with arugula) and L'Americano (chicken pieces & bacon)  which was all very delicious. 2 young servers was behind the counter and when they saw us struggling with the French menu, 'Mr Server"" explained the ordering process in English. Very pleasant experience with the staff and a yummy dinner. Highly recommended to try Pizzbox in Sherbrooke, QC."
PizzBox (St-√âlie),5,"Excellent food. Cool staff. Try the philly steak version, you'll adopt it!"
PizzBox (St-√âlie),3,"I tried their pizza for the first time and I wasn't impressed. It was very bland in flavor. Now I know why it's called ""Pizza Box."" It's because the pizza tastes like the box. All the toppings are very cheap in quality. Dominos, which is a cheapo pizza, is gourmet in comparison. I'm surprised that this place has received so many good reviews. I'm equally shocked that they can remain in business because it always looks empty every time I pass by the place. You can even tell how busy they are by looking at that info here on Google, which is not very busy.

This particular establishment didn't appear to be cleanliest. I worked within the food industry btw, as well as managed a commercial cleaning company. I know what I am talking about.
I relate the cleanliness problem to the staff being too young and inexperienced. This establishment is newly built. The men's bathroom door needs a good wiping down. You can see greasy hand prints and dirt on it. Countertops, floors, etc need to be wiped down more often. It isn't the worst kind of dirt for a food establishment, but this is not a good sign for a restaurant and building that is brand new. It indicates where it is heading.

I also wasn't impressed with 3 herb plants in pots on top of their sink, with hotel pans (steel storage containers) with the picked herbs from the plants within them. This is odd for a restaurant. If I were the owner I would be worried about eventually receiving a visit from a health inspector.

Putting aside my grievances, this place has potential if they wanted too. As for the pizza itself, it's eatable but that's about it."
PizzBox (Fleurimont),2,"Not a great fan of there pizza, it's below par stuff if you are used to eat a authentic pizza.
Like any other chain ‚õìÔ∏è restaurant it does it ls best to serve the good food but just not that high up in ranks ."
PizzBox (Fleurimont),5,Super fast and you choice your topping
PizzBox (Fleurimont),5,"You like pizza? I think you'll like this new and innovative way of putting together a pizza. In this shop, one size fits all. Depending on the number of toppings you pick, prices range from $10-$15. You select a sauce, a choice of a few cheeses and from quite an array of toppings. They put it together in front of you; then put it in an oven designed for this size of pizza. You purchase a drink if you wish - go to a table and someone will drop down your hot fresh tasty pizza. Fun and easy!"
PizzBox (Fleurimont),5,"Truly good choices, even an excellent gluten-free pizza. All pizza are thin-crust style and focus on flavor, not filling you with bread.  very appetizing choice. Staff was particularly friendly at this location."
PizzBox (Fleurimont),5,"Great pizza for the price, more refined and less greasy then your other 'fastfood pizzas'."
Manchu Wok (Carrefour de l'Estrie),3,"The place is ok, but the fried rice was not what I expected, it lacked the point of salt, not the best flavor.  And all the sweet and sour meats were also missing something.  I have eaten there other times and it has been much better, maybe a bad day?  The treatment of the staff is great.  I'll try again later, I think it's worth it."
Manchu Wok (Carrefour de l'Estrie),4,I loved it !! The food was tasteful and the staff super sweet !
Manchu Wok (Carrefour de l'Estrie),1,"Worst experience! Being so hungry and waiting for your food in the cold. Only to receive cold and not tasty at all food. Worst experience.
I do not recommend."
Manchu Wok (Carrefour de l'Estrie),5,"I ordered on ubereats and was delivered fast. Food is delicious and they gave me 3 small container of sauces however, all are the same honey glazed sauce, I think. For me, the rib is better with a vinegar or lemon sauce than the sweet sauce i got."
Manchu Wok (Carrefour de l'Estrie),1,"ordered beef with side noodles and vegetables.
Got 2 or 3 small and tough pieces of beef with 50% noodles and very small portion of vegetables. Not anything like the images on their website"
Sushi Shop - Sherbrooke,1,I had to wait 30 minutes because there was no rice.  Avocado is not fresh (brown pieces).  And the rice was VERY gluey and heavy.  Worst sushi experience I‚Äôve ever had.  This is not acceptable.
Sushi Shop - Sherbrooke,1,I wish I could give this sushi shop 0 stars. They don‚Äôt have enough employees clearly. Called for 40 minutes on a Monday and got no answer.
Sushi Shop - Sherbrooke,4,"Order an hour before pick up! They are only open from 11:00 to 3:00. Some in-house dining. No masks. I went with the Maki and super Maki. All good! Without the won ton soup, I would have paid $17. So, unless you got coin to spend, the sushi ain't cheap, but it's better than your supermarket variety!"
Sushi Shop - Sherbrooke,1,Really disappointing service I had to remind them to put the drink in my order and I payed extra for chicken in poke bowl but when I got home there was no chicken. I called and they said too bad they couldn't do anything about it and that i could send a complaint email to the company.  What is customer service coming to? Will not be encouraging this store in the future!
Sushi Shop - Sherbrooke,1,"no music, no greetings when i came in, place is not clean, and waiting time took forever. Very good experience in other sushi shop in the area. but not at this location ... probably my last visit here."
Traditions Gourmet,1,"Clean place with table service by a robot but in terms of prices, I was disappointed to pay $10 before tip, for two hot dogs without condiments or accompaniment. I had to go to the counter to get some mustard and ketchup wraps."
Traditions Gourmet,5,Great service. Good coffee. The awesome robot. Excellent customer service. The price very very affordable
Traditions Gourmet,1,Not as good as before and much less choice.
Traditions Gourmet,5,"I like the robot, impeccable service

Allo Couscous Shish Taouk (Sherbrooke),5,"First time tasted Moroccan Shish Taouk. The owner is very nice and friendly. The food is top-notch. I came to Sherbrooke for a day trip and I'm glad I found this restaurant. I initially thought, it might be an ordinary shish taouk like most of the middle eastern restaurants but after eating in here, I can definitely say, this one is one of the best. The chicken was well marinated and the French fries were very crispy. Must try if passing by this neighborhood. Highly recommended."
Allo Couscous Shish Taouk (Sherbrooke),5,I didn't expect a taste like this with food items that I have tasted before!..Really one of the most wonderful restaurants that I recommend visiting and tasting all its types!...The taste of meat and chicken..spices and mixtures are skillfully made!..I love my experiences and I congratulate the staff for their work and their hospitality!
Allo Couscous Shish Taouk (Sherbrooke),5,"Delicious food, it was my first visit to this restaurant. Living in Lennoxville it is worth the drive into Sherbrooke for this food! Below is a mixed meat plate and mixed meat pita.
I recommend both items!! Staff are very friendly. Fair price for these meals!!"
Allo Couscous Shish Taouk (Sherbrooke),5,"Great food, great portions and great prices. The meat was tender and flavourful! Recommend 100%"
Allo Couscous Shish Taouk (Sherbrooke),5,Man gadamn this place good 100/10üëç everything bussin
Guacamole y Tequila,3,"Nice atmosphere. We ordered Fajitas Poulet and Tostadas, they were decent but unfortunately the service is very slow and If you bring your car, there is not much parking space."
Guacamole y Tequila,5,What an excellent place for authentic Mexican food.  The staff are very friendly and the mood and atmosphere is vibrant.  Nice that you can order food with various spice or heat.  Great value.
Guacamole y Tequila,4,"Such an awesome little place! The food was really fresh and super tasty. The staff are AMAZING and really friendly. Incredible margaritas! Really great atmosphere, cozy decor, feels like being invited to someone's home for dinner. Had lunch which was 15$ for soup, main course and coffee.  Can't wait for the summer to sit on the patio in the sun sipping margaritas! üåû"
Guacamole y Tequila,4,"Very nice Mexican restaurant, the best in town dare I say. There is a little bit of wait yet the food is really worth it. Went there (and their sister restaurant in Magog) many times and would definitely go again! The churros as a dessert are a must try!"
Guacamole y Tequila,1,I went to eat here the other night and the whole experience was horrible. I got an entr√©e of chips with guacamole and a side of pico de gallo. I literally got like 7 chips and the pico was in a tiny little sauce container that was $3.50 extra. That was the best thing of the night which was pretty pathetic. It took over an hour to receive our food. I ordered 5 tacos and they were the tiniest most bland and even cold. The chorizo tacos actually tasted 100% like dog food..... yes I know what dog food tastes like. We told the server about all of our problems and she just said that Mexican food tastes like that.. I had spent $106 for me and my partner and we got nothing for that except a stomach ache and a drained wallet..... I will never give this place a second chance.
Chez Rima (Rue Galt),5,"This food was soooooo yummy. When we asked for only garlic sauce, they gave us twice the amount!!!! There was tons of chicken and it tasted amazing. I would give this restaurant 10 stars if I could. Definitely going back. I'd say this is one of my favorite restaurants I've ever eaten at. WOWüòçüòç"
Chez Rima (Rue Galt),5,"We've ordered from here 3 times in 3 months and every time, the food is the absolute best. The poutine is soooooooo good, the chicken is perfectly cooked, juicy. I recommend 110%"
Chez Rima (Rue Galt),5,Absolutely love going here. The food is just as good as the service. The owner is a joy and will greet you with the biggest smile. I feel very welcomed everytime I go and I take the wrap. I don't even have to tell them what I want because they always remember what I get. (Even if I dont go there for a few months).
Chez Rima (Rue Galt),5,Love the food and the gentleman that cooks and serves makes the experience extremely pleasant. Great customer service with great tasty foodüëå
Chez Rima (Rue Galt),4,"Amazing food and staff. Just sad that they reduced their portion of the sandwich by more than half. Used to go there twice a week but now go occasionally because I am left hungry afterwards. Besides that, shishtaouk plate is phenomenal."
Thai Express (Saint Fleurimont),1,"Unfortunately I had a very poor experience here.  The dish I ordered was supposed to have egg and Chinese brocoli.  As you can see in picture I got thin sliced carrots english tiny piece of brocoli, no egg, noodles were stuck together I was very dissatisfied I threw in the garbage, what a waste of time & money.  I notified head office, they responded once & then never heard back any follow up as to returning my money or why this should have even happened.   Sherbrooke,  Quebec
Not only did I have a bad experience, had to throw my food out, write this review, but Thai Express wrote back saying they would get back to me & let me just say this has been the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered.  So many times I reached out to them and not once have they written back correcting this situation in any way.  I am appalled at the way they operate.  I will never visit any of there locations nor will I recommend them in any way.  Very very poorexperience to say the least.

Thai Express (Saint Fleurimont),1,"Workers need better training. Tastes fine I guess but ordered cauliflower rice and got cauliflower in the place of rice??

Edit: they were not answering their phones and so I drove there to ask if my  dumplings used precooked chicken because mine is still pink. It‚Äôs a franchise so maybe that was the case and they‚Äôre just steamed frozen. Basically smiled while the workers yelled at me for five minutes so I thanked them and left and threw it in the trash. Informed them I didn‚Äôt want money I only had questions. Didn‚Äôt seem to matter.
The ‚Äúsoup‚Äù (the Thai racha chicken was sitting in a soup of juice because, no rice. Which honestly shouldn‚Äôt happen either, it usually sits on a bed of white rice) I received was funny until that point.
Professional answer would have been to just check the box they come in and let me know, if they‚Äôd answer the phone we could have kept it between us.
Also fyi despite their advertisement (it‚Äôs a franchise remember?)  the cauliflower was intentional because cauliflower rice ‚Äúis not good‚Äù.
Seriously avoid this place. It‚Äôs a joke to hospitality."
Thai Express (Saint Fleurimont),1,"Decent food. But we ordered multiple times from there and there is an error at least once every 2 order. Sometimes it's one meal wrong, but other times it's a whole other order entirely. Then we called, but no responses multiple times. We were never able to reach them."
Thai Express (Saint Fleurimont),5,"Really nice place, people are respectful and kind. Don't hesitate to ask for their opinions if you don't know what to pick, they will take the time to explain to you their menu."
Thai Express (Saint Fleurimont),1,"Ordered, deleviry closed before I received it, I called and someone that couldn't understand a word told me to call uber eat (I tried hard enough to tell her that I didn't ordered through uber eat), restaurant closed, never received it neither my money back even after trying to communicate with the support on their website. Will never order there again."
Super Pita,5,"Super friendly owner, food is amazing and well priced. There is a student deal (bring student card). I will be back to the restaurant soon!"
Super Pita,5,Really friendly and amazing cheap food for students!
Super Pita,5,It's a nice place to eat with some vegan dishes as an option. There is also other things that a non-vegan may also like. I would say that my overall experience has always been great since I go there and I would definitively recommend it to everyone to try it at least once.
Super Pita,5,J‚Äôadore ces restaurants. The owner is AMAZING and the food is just pure love into your belly. 150% definitely recommend. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Super Pita,5,Excellent! This place is worth the 100km needed from my place! Delicious food delivered by kind and joyfull employees. Definitely recommend!
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Sherbrooke),5,"My friends and I were hungry and looking for specifically a place that does burritos right. We are absolutely ecstatic that we stumbled upon Queseda. The lady who served us was extremely helpful, nice and quick. This establishment was clean and very professional looking. The food was fresh and extremely good. I had the burrito bowl and I was in absolute heaven. The flavours melded together in a beautiful combination. I never written a review on a restaurant but needed to praise such an amazing restaurant."
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Sherbrooke),5,"A nice place, where you can always enjoy a nice atmosphere, awesome DELICOUS, fresh food for a good price considering the current ""situation"".
My favorite restaurant now üòã"
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Sherbrooke),4,"It's like a subway for tacos. I.e
You get to select everything you want to be included in your buritto or taco. Clean and friendly."
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Sherbrooke),3,"Food was declicious. However, kids that work there should be taught a thing or two about customer service because they look like they want to kill themselves. Guess what, you still have 30 years of labor ahead of y'all."
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Sherbrooke),5,"This is so great I love it. The portions are good and with their app, you can earn points, I would highly recommend buying from this restaurant."
Caf√© restaurant L,5,"Such a pleasant experience:
Food tastes amazing, good portion size, cooked to the best
Atmosphere was nice and cozy
Service was nice
And the most important: customer service and hospitality was amazing üòä
You‚Äôd enjoy every minute you spend there
Wi-Fi as well if you‚Äôre traveling and you need to connect to internet"
Caf√© restaurant L,5,"Best Iranian food I‚Äôve had in Canada, and I‚Äôve eaten in Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver. The owner is extremely nice and personable. The food is sooo good I‚Äôve traveled over 2 hours for it.
The Koobideh is my favourite, but all kababs are tender. The saffron icecream is made in house and delicious. Perfect way to end the meal.

I will definitely visit again. If I could give the restaurant and service 10 stars I would. Merci for everything!"
Caf√© restaurant L,5,"So deliciousÔºåI ordered the twin beef rice, I have to give a five star rate before I finish the food. Definitely will order again"
Caf√© restaurant L,5,Wonderful place to get high quality Persian cuisine. The kabobs and the rice were cooked to perfection. The presentation and the care taken were great. Very good prices and quick service. Very friendly staff. Very cozy atmosphere and a very good experience. Highly recommended!
Caf√© restaurant L,5,"I totally enjoyed the service. The meal was excellent. Staff and management were very approachable and friendly. In between, the manager greeted us which it was nice of him."
Au Sanglier Dor√©,5,Great place! The food is amazing. Simple and delicious. The drinks are great and well served. Staff is always very friendly and accomodating.
Au Sanglier Dor√©,4,"First time to visit the place out of curiosity as we are checking places to eat for supper.service is good.food is very good.not the typical brasserie type that serves fries.i love their concept of side dishes and accompaniments. Duck truffle sausage is awesome.Good portions ...so full that i had no place for dessert.
Deco is true to their theme. (Medievalistic)"
Au Sanglier Dor√©,5,"Everything there is nice and cozy!

The tavernier is making auoer drinks!

The menu is always changing a little. Keep an eye on it.

Orice are good! But caution.. the big bread is expensive! Unless you are 4 people. Take the small one instead."
Au Sanglier Dor√©,1,The food is fine and the theme is cool. But everytime I went there me and my friends felt very disrespected. I will never return to this place.
Au Sanglier Dor√©,5,Haven't eaten there yet but wow does it look good! The medieval decor is astounding.
McDonald's (Arthur St),5,"Quick service, food was ok. They probably have better coffee than Tim Horton."
McDonald's (Arthur St),1,"Downloaded their app and sent customer service an email asking how to unsubscribe from the thousands of emails every day for food I will never eat. Instead of replying to the email, they just deleted my account completely. Didn't let me know they were doing it either, just all of a sudden my account didn't exist and points I had were all wiped out. Won't be downloading the app again if it means a bunch of emails I don't want and that's extremely poor customer ""service"" in my opinion. If I could rate 0 stars I would have"
McDonald's (Arthur St),3,Typical fast food. Fries are always either cold or as hot as the sun. Drive-through always tells you to pull over and they eventually bring the food to your car. Pleasant service.
McDonald's (Arthur St),1,Old lady does not like kids. Will not go here again due to her ignorance towards my son. 3 year olds get excited when they come here and she continues to have ignorant remarks towards children. Not the first time I have seen this.
McDonald's (Arthur St),1,"So this is the third time in the past fee months that my orders have been so messed up. I could not understand the girl at the drive through, it's unfortunate but the accent was too thick. I got my order and it wasn't placed properly so I had to go inside and it still ain't placed properly because the guy at the till had minimal communication in English. Not a pleasant experience to start the day. Highly would not recommend."
Boston Pizza (Thunder Bay),5,This place has great pizza loved it. I recommend the cheesy bread
Boston Pizza (Thunder Bay),5,Came in for pizza üçï and ended up with garlic shrimp mac and cheese. Very happy trying BP for the first time. Maybe next jaunt into CA I'll try the pizza. Thx for the good service too. üòÄ
Boston Pizza (Thunder Bay),3,"I really like the food here; however, the service is terrible more than half time I go here.

Going to stop giving 20-30% tips for now on.

Would be nice to just pick my order give the cooks a $20 tip each time"
Boston Pizza (Thunder Bay),1,Very bad experience last night . Ordered dinner and some drinks go to pay and the server Carly f. Told us to tip her cause she pays ten bucks for the table we were dinning at. I was gonna tip her but not after that experience. Afterwards she kept giving me and my family dirty looks. We attend this bp regularly but not after last nights experience.
Boston Pizza (Thunder Bay),4,This location was very clean and great friendly service. I would give it a 5 but honestly boston pizza is making all their food too peppery ruining a lot of it. Bandera bread was amazing though.
Pizza Hut (707 Memorial Ave.),3,"I struggled to understand the accent of the person taking our order, and though she said ""bone in or boneless"" three times exactly the same it really didn't help but eventually my daughters friend figured it out.
One of our pizzas was supposed to be half  pepperoni but they missed that completely.
Other than that the food was very tasty."
Pizza Hut (707 Memorial Ave.),1,"Lady at the front told me, her recipe for tomato is only this much, super rude, never coming back"
Pizza Hut (707 Memorial Ave.),5,The place is on the main road and probably very fast at the orders. The pizza delieverd to us was fresh and colour and taste was also good  and Wow wow wow it's the first time that I tried pizza hut . I ordered the pan chicken ceasar and it is sooooo good and crispy!!! The guy who handled the pizza today was very polite and nice. Definitely will come back! Thank you üòä
Pizza Hut (707 Memorial Ave.),3,Has gotten  better since they got rid of thre whities and repalced them with Indian people.
Pizza Hut (707 Memorial Ave.),1,"Original service was amazing but after I called back to ask a question someone else answered and were very abrupt and rude. After they provided an answer of no I said ok, no worries, have a great night and they cut me off in the middle of my sentence. That is not how you treat a customer and I‚Äôm speaking as someone who works for a restaurant and deals with customers all day. Needs work. I can accept no as an answer but not rude customer service in return"
Goodlife Foods Co.,1,"I have ordered from this place online a decent amount of times. But I went in person yesterday. We stood at the order counter for 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged our existence (not a big deal it was 6:30) then when we ordered were told ‚Äúthat is going to take a long time, like 10 minutes‚Äù like? Okay? I still want it. We order our second item and are told ‚ÄúI have to check if we have the ingredients‚Äù so he never moves from where he‚Äôs standing and asks what we wanted again then we say. We go find our table and another 45 minutes go by and the person that was behind us in line gets served first (no big deal we ordered the ‚Äò10 minute‚Äô item) however the person that was in front of us was still waiting. So on to the food, we ordered the beef raider burrito. Now correct me if I am wrong, but something called a beef raider should have beef it, this burrito was 90%rice 7%veggies 2%sauce and 1% beef. When went went up to complain we told told that he‚Äôd make a new one, at this point it is just us in here and not even the skip noise has gone off. We waited another 25 minutes for this burrito and when I turned and looked no one was making it. The Azteka salad, this is the only thing I have ever eaten here, I love it, it‚Äôs delicious was still delicious when I ate it yesterday, this is the item were were originally told they needed to see if all of the ingredients were there for it. Because they weren‚Äôt, the salad comes with feta cheese Parmesan was added. We ended up leaving without the burrito."
Goodlife Foods Co.,5,"Indian and Mexican fusion finally.   The service was great and the menu has a huge selection of burritos,  bowls, salads tacos and family dinners.   I had a paneer taco and it was amazing.   Price was decent,  49$ to feed 4 adults."
Goodlife Foods Co.,3,"They have some of the East Indian foods including Dosa(masala dosa),
Burrito bowl either with butter chicken or veg options like butter paneer.
The food is good and the price is really reasonable.
If we are goin for burrito bowl, there is not wait time at all, but if you are ordering dosa try ti gibe them a call and order ahead to avoid waiting"
Goodlife Foods Co.,1,"I ordered samosas and they were awful literally drenched in oil , there was lots of oil inside them , i would never eat here again"
Goodlife Foods Co.,5,"Came across on our travels while searching skip for gluten free options. This place had also been previously recommended by family that used to live here. They have the most amazing salad selection I‚Äôve ever seen! Everything on the menu looks amazing. I opted for the vibrant venus salad and was not disappointed. Extremely large potion, generous on the protein.
Would highly recommend !!"
KFC (2013 Arthur Street East),3,The food was ok. I got a lunch box. The packaging wasnt great and looked really rushed but the food was good. I mean it's fast food so it's good and I'll be back. I liked the zinger burger and potato salad.
KFC (2013 Arthur Street East),4,"It's been more than 15 years when I stopped buying KFC so I decided to go and try the chicken bacon sandwich and it was really good. 4 Stars because cleaning should be more taken care of. As every single table was dirty. I took the most ""decent one"" fries are good and coleslaw. Service was fast."
KFC (2013 Arthur Street East),5,"I had some speedy service today at the house that Sanders built. Cheap and fast order. I love KFC gravy, so I got a bucket of that with my double big stack chicken burger, small popcorn chicken and a large order of fries.
Obviously not the place for vegetarian or vegans. There is limited indoor dining, or place and order online for pickup or delivery."
KFC (2013 Arthur Street East),1,"Was there today and decided to dine in since there was no one in the store. What a mistake, at least four employees working but the store was disgusting. Two bites out of my ‚Äútwister‚Äù and lost my appetite so through out my lunch, in an overflowing garbage. The floor, drink machine and tables were absolutely disgusting. Imagine what the kitchen looks like. Where are the owners or at the very least management?"
KFC (2013 Arthur Street East),1,"Paid over $70.00 for 2 Big Crunch stackers, small popcorn chicken, 2 poutines and 9 chicken tenders, we got all the way home and we were missing a stacker and the popcorn chicken. Do better at checking the orders before you dish them out, we wasted gas going all the way back to get the rest of our food."
Robin's (300 May Street S),5,"The woman at the till is an incredibly kind soul and I love the food and drinks there. They have great sandwiches, donuts and coffee. This is my favourite place to get coffee. Much better than Tim Hortons. 5 stars deserved. Thank you for the great experience. :)"
Robin's (300 May Street S),5,My dogs appreciate the treats and the people serving me. They have yet to bark at any of my fellow workers. That says everything to me
Robin's (300 May Street S),5,Coffee is always the right strength and sugar and cream amounts on point. Unlike the other location.
Robin's (300 May Street S),5,"Stopped in at Robins and enjoyed a delicious Nanaimo bar! Freshly made, light sugar, not too sweet, just right. The bottom was coconut crumbleüëå"
Robin's (300 May Street S),5,Always hit up a Robin's when I'm on the city.  Good coffee and donuts. Lady at the Window was friendly
Wendy's (950 Memorial Avenue),4,"Nice and clean place to grab a fast meal.
Very fast service, tasty food fresh and hot.

The main problem is that the front door wheelchair accessibility doesn't work! And some employees don't understand what we ask ..

Plus be aware they got B from the health unit."
Wendy's (950 Memorial Avenue),3,"Kids ordered frostys they had change and used it, Im Assuming it was the manager or supervisor who came to the window and told us next time we need at least a 10.00 bill it came to 16.00. Was 13.00 in loonies and quarters rest Dimes and nickles I could see if there was a line up but there wasn't plus we waited at least 8 min or more for our stuff. And it's kids for goodness sakes one with a disability.  The girl at the take out window was very kind tho and apologized for taking so long."
Wendy's (950 Memorial Avenue),1,I guess do to labour shortage. N Canada's  immigration  policy we the people who live here have to lower our standards  because it seems this restaurant  is lowering its standards. Hiring hard to understand  staff. Who seem like they hate there  job n have 0 personality  when it comes to service  i hope elon makes robots soon cus robots  can be properly  programmed.  The pic. Is a fly someone  stuck to the  glass at my table. If i saw it!!! Staff are completely  blind or dont care. I find it sad u call this fast food. No line up at the  till  n i waited 10 mins for a 1 star burger. Im only able to lower my standards  to what they are now any lower n ill be eating out of the  dumpster  out back. Its probably  cleaner then inside.
Wendy's (950 Memorial Avenue),1,"Tempurature is +32¬∞C at the time of review. The lobby smelled of urine, there was no AC in the lobby and most of the tables were dirty. The food was OK at best, the frostys were basically chocolate milk, ice machine was broken, pop fountain in the lobby was out of order and the fountain for drive thru which was serving the whole restaurant had a broken ice maker and there was 0 carbonation, there was no condiments available to guests other than ketchup packets. Overall abismal dine in experience and evidence suggests a similar experience for drive thru customers."
Wendy's (950 Memorial Avenue),5,"Got a free lovely breakfast today. Seems like new product coming up. Really tasty, fresh as always. Love Wendy's, excellent staff, excellent company."
Monsoon Indian Cuisine,5,Amazing variety in the buffet for a great price! The restaurant was clean and inviting. Service was great as well.
Monsoon Indian Cuisine,4,"Great experience goin there for dine in.
Went for a dinner on a Sunday eve and the server who was the only one on the day, helped really good and was really friendly.
Food didnt take any long and the food was really good.
Tried lamb biriyani, beef biriyani and nan with palak paneer and chilli chicken.
Everything was tasty.
I had also tried their buffet which only happens on pirticular days a week and thats a good proce too.
Overall a great indian food experience."
Monsoon Indian Cuisine,5,"Every food item individually well-packaged came in uber eats . with the dishes, I received complementary rice.
The rotis and garlic naan were delicious. Malai kofta and daal tadka were Less spicy, but equally delicious,"
Monsoon Indian Cuisine,5,Food has a very authentic taste and portion sizes are huge. Very reasonable prices. Would definitely try it again.
Monsoon Indian Cuisine,4,"It was so good! We got the monsoon papa chicken, butter chicken, chana masala, naan platter, samosas, and gulab jamun. The portions were moderate‚Äî they weren‚Äôt super big, and the price was okay (ranging from $17-20 for bigger dishes, and $6-9 for the side dishes). It was super flavourful‚Äî we ordered mild-medium spiciness level, and it was good for us! Definitely would come back üî•üî•üî•"
Curry Up Now,2,"Bought ""burrito bowl"" today around 3pm-4pm
*The yellow rice was dry i wasn't abel to chew.
*The chicken tikka which they gave me it was just gravy, found 2 slice of chicken inside the gravy(really unfair).
*the chicken was overcooked

*The taste wasn't good.

About my previous orders around 1am-3am morning ""burrito bowl"" doesn't remember the dates.

>butter chicken was nice had lot of chicken pieces.
> good portion was served.
> the rice was good.
>everything was perfect.

Will give a try someday, if had a bad exp again than you will loss a customer."
Curry Up Now,2,"Ordered chicken biryani. The overall portion size was good but the portion of chicken is very small. And I am giving this review as I have tried other Indian restaurants that were able to maintain a standard. I did not like the quality of rice. It was overcooked and mushy. Did not feel like restaurant quality. Except for the heat coming from spices, the biryani's taste was bland. Indian cuisine in Thunder Bay is expensive. I expect everything to be top notch at that price. This was disappointing. I'll rather order from other Indian restaurant next time. P.S: It was an online order through Skip the dishes app."
Curry Up Now,5,"Edit: Came here again, got the Naughty Butter Chicken Chaat. So I can handle the spice, since the flavour is SOO GOOD. This dish is amazing! Well done! Wish it were less spicy on my baby tongue still. The samosas in butter chicken sauce are amazing.

TOO SPICY! Every time I order from them their butter chicken is different. Container/Portion size, Spicy-ness please be consistent and less spicy. Samosas, Rice and Gulab Jamun are yummy though."
Curry Up Now,1,"Just an hour back today I.e 31/01/2024 ordered 2 chicken biryani's over the phone for pickup around 12:45pm and I told the lady I'll come in 10 mins and pickup my order. They said ok it will be ready. When I went in there biryani's were not ready and she was telling me that biryani is under process it will take  10 more mins, I said it's ok and waited till 10 mins and went in to pick up my order. When I picked up my order the biryani's were cold and then I understood that biryani was last night's leftovered one. I came home and unpacked the biryani. The quantity was less and the chicken pieces were very dry. Their services are very poor and the lady who served me is the owner of the restaurant. The owner itself is doing like this means how the restaurant runs well. I think she is feeling proud that none of the Indian restaurants do well in Thunder Bay except her restaurant."
Curry Up Now,3,"I honestly love the food here, i order it a bunch from skip the dishes, unfortunately i was eating my food and enjoying it until I found a long thin hair stuck in my basmati rice. I was repulsed. I understand that happens sometimes but thats why hair nets are a thing. Ill still or order from here but if that happens again I will not anymore."
Taco Time (679 Memorial Avenue),2,Ordered a beef and cheese burrito...  received 1 with lettuce tomatoes.. white stuff... not good.  Won't be driving 10 miles to bring back...  never again Tt.
Taco Time (679 Memorial Avenue),5,"The staff was amazing! Even when another customer was impatient and demanding their food they all stayed calm and professional, got the man's food an continued to attend to the rest of the guests!
Great service"
Taco Time (679 Memorial Avenue),5,Great service. Fast food tacos at their finest.  Clean dining room.   Never disappoint.
Taco Time (679 Memorial Avenue),5,Tried it before but not the restaurant more like a fast food booth tried and didn't like.  The restaurant was a way better experience food was great and place was clean.
Taco Time (679 Memorial Avenue),5,They make good tacos and have Taco Tuesday which is when they sell tacos for $2.
Pho Umami,5,"I‚Äôm someone who enjoys a light and simple diet and prefers foods cooked with fewer ingredients. So this Pho Nam perfectly satisfies my palate.
The soup is extremely delicious with light but rich flavor.
The beef is also very incredibly tender
I had twice of the same pho and I definitely will be back."
Pho Umami,3,"It's our 1st time here and I ordered lunch special with beef n greens and my hubby ordered special wonton soup.

My food was okay. Big portion for 14.99 and for wonton soup special.  It was okay too, could be better if they use rice noodles and have pho spoon.

The place is clean and big."
Pho Umami,3,"I would do 3.5 if possible, as it wasn‚Äôt horrible.
The pho broth was pretty tasty, the only disappointment was for the price there was barely any meat. I‚Äôm used to pho being loaded especially when you‚Äôre getting a mixture of meat types.
Lots of noodles.
The spring rolls were alright, also stingy on the meat (I didn‚Äôt get a photo) but I did appreciate that they split the order in two with two dipping bowls as we split the order and meant we could ‚Äúdouble dip‚Äù so to speak.
The place has a strange atmosphere. It‚Äôs very open, and when you walk in it seems like you‚Äôre walking into an establishment that is currently under construction. There‚Äôs an empty entry way, and you need to walk past it to get to the actual restaurant. It can give the impression it‚Äôs not open or there isn‚Äôt an active business.
Staff was friendly enough. Food arrived with a decent time.
I probably won‚Äôt return, as I‚Äôm not from the area. But it did the trick to soothe my Vietnamese cravings."
Pho Umami,2,"First the good; the atmosphere seemed okay, the food didn't take too long to come out.
Now what you want to hear - the pho came with cilantro and not basil (she said they ""ran out"") and no hot peppers (good thing I brought my own).  The broth was barely passable, they were very stingy with the beef (for almost 20 bucks a bowl I felt swindled), and they don't have the proper spoons.  I know much of this sounds trivial, but it all adds up to a less than enjoyable experience.  Who has the word ""pho"" in their name and not have basil??
Also had the spring rolls, they were not terrible."
Pho Umami,4,"Pretty cozy atmosphere! Service was a bit slow but it doesn't seem like there's a lot of people working, maybe 3. Very friendly staff.
When the food arrived, it was good. Good portion for price and with the pho there were lots of meat. Humble establishment, good food."
Kelseys (805 Memorial Ave),5,Went there with a large group of people for a birthday celebration. Our server Kodi It was incredible. He was engaging and entertaining and took care of our table very efficiently. It was a great experience!  Great food and great atmosphere.
Kelseys (805 Memorial Ave),4,"Had an amazing time this last time. Our servers are always friendly. And, the food is always fresh. It has a lot of TVs near the bar for you to view and a lot of sports games/ programming to view depending on where you want to sit. Wide selection of beverage options. The only low calorie options seem to be water and diet coke. They have a great selection of specialty drinks for you to choose from. The menu had everything from bar food burgers and nachos. To steak fish and salads. As well as pasta dishes. I really enjoyed the lunch special trio bbq chicken sandwich, soup broccoli chedder, and salad. The salad was amazing. It had feta, dried berries, raisens, tomateos, onion with nuts, in spring mix with a special vinaigrette. Will for sure want the soup and salad again in the future. On other occasions. I had the swiss mushroom burger, onion rings, and the spinach dip. The burger was some what ok, the onion rings were great but small as portion, and the spinach dip was great, with fried peta to dip in it."
Kelseys (805 Memorial Ave),5,"Kodie was our server and he was unreal! I have celiac disease and he took the extra time to make sure that my meal was safe to eat with the kitchen (salmon), and I felt confident in this. He also had a great energy, was super friendly and attentive. Great experience! I‚Äôll be coming back for sure."
Kelseys (805 Memorial Ave),5,"Good food, great drinks and excellent customer service. Kodie was friendly, checked in on us more than a few times. Always makes the experience more enjoyable!"
Kelseys (805 Memorial Ave),2,"We were there when the power went out. After being there for an hour,  we had the choice of leaving or having our dinner with cold fries and barely warm everything else, so we chose to stay.  Seeimg that our orders were going to he thrown out, I thought we might get a break on the bill. Our drinks were free, we had water and one gravy wasn't charged for.  The Cajun chicken wings had no spice at all, just a greasy taste. So much for our evening out. We tried ti fill out the survey but we didn't get a proper bill because the POWER WAS OUT. We have a handwritten bill with no date just the total so we couldn't give a ticket  number.  Do  no survey"
A&W (526 Memorial Ave),1,I went with someone in a wide wheelchair. The ramp is not flush with the ground and the doors are not on buttons. So people had to hold doors. There was not enough space for me to open the second door to fit through and get buy at the same time. Very poorly set up
A&W (526 Memorial Ave),5,"Fast food, but good food. Consistent with what I expect from A&W"
A&W (526 Memorial Ave),2,"What happened to your Beyond Burger.
I used to love it, but the last two times it was like mush!
Are you microwaving it or what?"
A&W (526 Memorial Ave),5,So i am in love!! With the frozen rootbeer with cream shake! I live out of town about 3 hours to the nearest town and often travel there for app and what not . So i didcivered these delisouse delights and vowed to come back one day and this time id buy 10 no 20!! Well the next week i honored ny promise and hit up the first place i seen ( this one) and low and behond their machine was down:( no for real :( i then drove around to about 3 other a and ws idk but alot till finally the last one i was gonna try had a working machine!! Haalaloya it was a festivfus miracle i screamed. But ya back to this place i was happy with the shake first visit even tho food was not even room temp when i was literally only person there so how long does this food sit to get below room temp? Your guesse is as good as mine thank god i got iron guts .but i have to knock off points because its so so unacceotable to have your machine down for 2 visits now? And i have a sneaking suspicion its not down just workers to lazy to clean it lol
A&W (526 Memorial Ave),5,"Great burgers, nice employees. I wish the burger patties were juicer tho.
And, the small juice glass is weird looking."
Salween Restaurant,5,"I loved it! It was delicious! I ordered the Cashew Stirfry and it was perfect, lots of delicious vegetables and the shrimp was so good! I have zero complaints, I had a great experience, the food is great. Big serving sizes too! Made a great dinner."
Salween Restaurant,5,Located in what appears to be a more outdated part of town but the food is still delicious. A bit on the mild side compared to other Thai restaurants which is fine for those who don't like it spicy. Portion sizes are great with very reasonable prices. I would definitely recommend this to any visitors to Thunder Bay.
Salween Restaurant,5,"Super yummy foods! We were going to Toronto and drove by this place. We ordered all five different items on the menu and they were all so good! I would like to suggest to the white folks, get out of your comfort zone and try different menus other than ‚ÄúPad Thai‚Äù. If you want to try one of these menus, you can just show them the following pictures! I‚Äôm definitely returning if I‚Äôm ever going to drive by Thunder Bay. Satisfaction level is 100% üëçüèºüëçüèºüëåüèºüëåüèº"
Salween Restaurant,5,"A gem in thunder bay! Burmese cuisine is difficult to find and this restaurant had such a great selection of dishes. Had the tea leaf salad and tum carrot salad, both were really delicious. Would definitely return if I pass through TB again!"
Salween Restaurant,5,"The food was delicious and there were three dishes and spring rolls ordered!
We will be ordering from there again! Absolutely delicious and the portions were great!"
Little Caesars (Arthur St W),1,"My boyfriend use to work here. I got banned from bringing him in his beverage (I'd get a drink when he started from my job at Shoppers, next door) to keep him hydrated for the day. The boss only favored her children who she hired to only work there, she treated her children awfully
If you EVER complain about them and they know you, get ready to be banned for life. lol"
Little Caesars (Arthur St W),1,If your going to make up your own hours and close at random times  at least update your hours on Google first so people don't show up to a locked up and closed location on a day that is not a holiday.
Little Caesars (Arthur St W),5,Picked up a couple pizzas for our trip home a few hours away. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and recieved very friendly service. There wasn't a Hawaiian in the warmer so the assistant manager fired one up for us and it was done up very fast. All of the staff was very professional and the storefront was very clean. From what I could see the back was tidy as well. This is a great place to grab a quick and affordable pizza when your on the go. Very tasty and fresh ingredients. Thanks a bunch and look forward to stopping in again!
Little Caesars (Arthur St W),1,I placed a large order online and there was items missing and they don't answer there phone. Thats hooked up to a facts machine.
Little Caesars (Arthur St W),4,Can't relay complain much. You get what you order. Their fast and cheap. Kids love it and that's all that matters to me most days.
Macao Imperial Tea (Thunder Bay),3,I was unimpressed with the quality and flavors of the food I purchased. Beef dishes were watery and tasteless. Rice was soggy. Vegetable dishes were bland. Chicken balls were hard and tough meat. The service was pleasant. The atmosphere is homey. 3 out of 5 is generous.
Macao Imperial Tea (Thunder Bay),5,"Very good service and food. Only drawback is the seats ( benches) are mot very comfortable.  We didn't sit and  chat  after the meal. Also, one of my favourite meals is Singapore noodles  however, you cannot order a single serving.  Only a meal for 2. Strange."
Macao Imperial Tea (Thunder Bay),5,Always very friendly service both on the phone and when you enter. Food is excellent. Great prices and a dinner will last me 3 meals lol.
Macao Imperial Tea (Thunder Bay),1,"(I rarely write bad reviews but I had to share for those ordering delivery).
Sorry I tried to like it, but worst chinese food and most expensive I have ordered.
Temperature was good and the service was fast as I was told it was busy.  The egg rolls and chicken balls were ok but the garlic ribs were tiny bits with a lot of hard pieces. Chicken fried rice tasteless.  Wonton soup had it's own taste, not the regular taste of a wonton soup.  Ate the stock of the soup but threw the rest in the garbage including the ribs, and rest of rice.  TOO BAD to throw it out since the trio plate at 17.95$, 2 egg rolls (7$), and a soup (7.75$), added up to 45,80$.  Hard to understand the bill but had like 10$+ of extra fees.  With the tip it added up to 53.80$ for a plate, soup and 2 egg rolls.  I understand that taste can be subjective, but all the added fees should have been told and explained to the customer."
Macao Imperial Tea (Thunder Bay),5,So good! Best egg rolls in town! Superb service and excellent food.
The Bannock Lady,5,I‚Äôm new to Thunder Bay and was happy to see The Bannock Lady sign.  On my first visit I tried the Bannock Hotdog‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.yummmmy!  I have since had the balongna sandwich and the bannock hamburger and have been pleased with it all.  Each item is delicious and very filling as well as very well priced.  A great meal for a great price:)
The Bannock Lady,1,"At the CLE fair, I had ordered bannock burgers. The blonde woman handling money was putting the food together, too. No gloves, no hand washing, whatsoever. The burger was so bland, I waited more than half an hour in line, then only noticed she was handling money and making the food after ordering.  I spent too much for a bland burger and stood too long in line, and I‚Äôm not one to make a scene. So, I hoped for the best, only to have an upset stomach. Do better, you‚Äôre going to make more people sick."
The Bannock Lady,5,Awesome!!!  Delish! Generous portions at a low price!!  Totally recommend
The Bannock Lady,1,"I had terrible food poisoning.. :(( Ordered the Indian Taco Deluxe, it was kind of bland, not much seasoning on the meat. I've had better. At 2:00AM, I suffered for it and ended up vomitting because my stomach was in too much pain even with the pepto and tums I was taking. I would not recommend eating here ever. The Indian Taco Deluxe should be more like The Indian Taco Disaster.."
The Bannock Lady,5,I would definitely go back to this establishment again
Tokyo House,5,"They have come a long way in quality. The food is a bit pricey but it's all you can eat seafood, it's not cheap. They have a great selection of rolls, and even with the language barrier they are still very courteous. I highly recommend you try their Hawaiian roll while you're there. Very overlooked but a phenomenal balance of sweet and savory. My go to place for sushi in thunder bay now."
Tokyo House,5,"We really enjoyed Tokyo House. The sushi was good and the service was great despite having a sign posted that they were short staffed. The place was clean and had a nice ambiance. My favourite was the summer roll (pictured with the kiwi on top), very sweet with unexpected ingredients. Would definitely recommend this place."
Tokyo House,5,"Some of the best sushi I've had, great quality and very well made. The restaurant is fantastic, you get up to 3 orders for AYCE. ""Expensive items"" such as butter fish and salmon sashimi are limited to 10pc per person per visit. The staff is very kind, this place is well worth the visit üíØ"
Tokyo House,3,"Overall the food was pretty good, would definitely go again, but I advise being prepared for a long time to wait for your orders to come in as they only had two people in the kitchen, and two people serving, one being the manager who also sat us. The restaurant itself was not that busy, they have signs up stating they‚Äôre only allowed to have five tables at a time due to their shortage of staff. So of course the wait time is to be expected, but not to the extent it was. Overall would go again, but only every once in a while as the dinner for all - you - can - eat for adults was $39.75 per person."
Tokyo House,5,"Great service and servers, friendly staff! The fish was amazing - fresh and well assembled sushi and sashimi. The other dishes were great as well and all came through timely."
Montana's (Thunder Bay),5,Great Montana's well kept. Attentive staff. Good food. Fun mod was to change the chicken tacos to bang bang shrimp.
Montana's (Thunder Bay),5,"Stopped in here during my travels through Thunder Bay and was very happy with the experience.  The food and atmosphere were very good and the service was amazing.  The server wrote her name as Hayley.  She was very friendly, smiled throughout my stay there and gave a good suggestion when I asked what's good even though it was busy.  Buttermilk Fried Chicken for the win!  Thanks Hayley and Montana's in Thunder Bay, will definitely stop in next time through town!"
Montana's (Thunder Bay),4,"Went in last weekend. Server basically forgot about our table. Kiddo never got his drink, plates were never removed from the table. Had to ask for the kids dessert about 3 times. Server spent a lot of time chatting with her other table. Poor time management or too many tables. Spinach dip was good tho!"
Montana's (Thunder Bay),5,"Went for a late supper after a very long day and the staff was amazing and fast with service. This is especially from our server Eve who was kind, courteous and funny. Would definitely recommend visiting due to the friendly atmosphere and enjoyable food experience."
Montana's (Thunder Bay),5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Montana's and I must say, it was an exceptional experience. From the moment I walked in, Bryannah, our server, provided us with outstanding service that was both nice and caring. Her attentiveness and commitment to ensuring our dining experience was top-notch were truly commendable.

Bryannah's warm and friendly demeanor made us feel welcome right away. She took the time to explain the menu and made excellent recommendations based on our preferences. Her knowledge of the dishes and willingness to accommodate our dietary needs was impressive. It was evident that she genuinely cared about our satisfaction and went above and beyond to ensure we had a memorable meal.

Throughout the evening, Bryannah remained attentive without being intrusive. She always had a smile on her face and promptly attended to any requests or questions we had. Her efficiency and professionalism were truly remarkable, and it made the overall dining experience even more enjoyable.

One piece of advice I would give to those considering dining at Montana's is to visit mid-week. During our visit, the restaurant was relatively quiet, allowing Bryannah to provide personalized attention to each table. It was evident that the mid-week atmosphere allowed the staff to focus more closely on their guests, resulting in an even more delightful dining experience.

In terms of the food, Montana's did not disappoint. The menu offered a wide range of mouth-watering options, and the quality of the dishes was superb. From the succulent ribs to the perfectly cooked steaks, every bite was a delight to the taste buds. The portions were generous, and the presentation was visually appealing.

Overall, my experience at Montana's was exceptional, and much of that credit goes to Bryannah for her exceptional service. Her friendly and caring nature, coupled with her attention to detail, truly elevated our dining experience. I highly recommend visiting Montana's and, if you have the opportunity, being served by Bryannah. Just remember, for the best experience, try to visit mid-week when the restaurant is less crowded. You won't be disappointed"
Bliss,5,"Oh my what an amazing spot.  I've been to lots of vegan/plant based, gluteen free spot and can say for sure this spot is dynamite.  The cookies and sweets were fresh, full and huge.  Tons of hot sauces, frozen meals to go.  They have a scotch bonnet jam that my friend and I polished off in 2 days.  Best hot jam/sauce ever.  Amazing.  The ladies were very kind and made us feel right at home.  Everyone needs to give those place some love."
Bliss,5,"Teena and Lynn at Bliss did an amazing job at catering our wedding for us! The gluten-free and vegan platters were a huge hit. So many of our friends were grateful to be able to enjoy and indulge at our wedding. The wedding cake was spectacular! People are still raving about it even weeks after our wedding! The support, service and quality provided to us by the team at Bliss was above and beyond our expectations. We cannot recommend them enough! Thank you so much for being a part of our special day!"
Bliss,5,"Teena and Lynn exceeded all our expectations as caterers for our wedding. From the very beginning, they were so helpful with planning- from arranging tastings, to discussing options and accepting feedback. There was no guesswork because there was clear and consistent communication. The day of the wedding, Teena was wonderful with delivery and set up and even gave us a hand with a few other things that needed to be done. The food was delicious and the presentation was beautiful. All our guests loved it! I cannot thank them both enough for all their hard work. I will definitely recommend Bliss to others in the future!"
Bliss,5,"Wow! A shop with all vegan / plant based things! Amazing!! Loveedd the ‚Äútwix‚Äù bar!

Very impressed with their creativity to create delicious things for all the dietary restrictions yet still make them look so good and taste taste good too!

Can‚Äôt wait to try other items on their menu!

And the artwork with the b incorporated was just sooo beautiful!"
Bliss,5,"My favourite restaurant is open again!!!
They have new items and old favs. All gluten free, vegan, refined sugar free.
I got the jalape√±o ""cheddar"" veggie burger, charcuterie bowl, ginger cookie and Twix bar.

All are SO good and you'd hardly know they're vegan. Love to have fresh options in TBay.

They also do pizza, variety of burgers, bowls, treats... they'll be having smoothies and bulk items, grab and go salads, meal kits etc etc.

I am in no way affiliated just a loyal customer haha."
Edo Japan -  Brentwood Village,4,"It was really fast, affordable, friendly and great service. I loved their menu. Just a lot of fantastic and easy to choose from. They had a lot of variety. From sushi to soups to cooked meals (Rice meals, noodle meals, Bento boxes) to starters etc. I was craving sushi last night so I went there to order their Easi Sushi Platter. I loved it. So delicious. I cannot wait to try their other meals. I am so sure this place will become a staple for my takeout meals."
Edo Japan -  Brentwood Village,5,"I recently visited Edo Japan to try their veggie sushi and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm smile from the staff and a welcoming atmosphere. The restaurant had a modern and clean feel, which immediately made me feel comfortable."
Edo Japan -  Brentwood Village,5,"Fast and friendly service. I was greeted as if i were Norm walking into Cheers.
This is the type of fast food I should be eating. Japanese cuisine that is delicious and prepared quickly.
Wheelchair accessible parking and entrance. Prices are fair and the teriyaki sauce is some of the best I‚Äôve ever tasted. I‚Äôm not the biggest sushi fan, but I am a massive stir fry supporter.
Kids menu and vegetarian items are also available."
Edo Japan -  Brentwood Village,5,"I get takeout from here regularly. And I it‚Äôs nothing fancy, but it‚Äôs always good.
I recommend the spring rolls, and chicken and beef rice bowl with two scoops of teriyaki sauce. Order ahead of time on their app because they‚Äôre usually quite busy."
Edo Japan -  Brentwood Village,3,"Not Bad sushi at all. Honestly a place I prefer to go to for a quick sushi pickup. Staff is Friendly and the food is great, but This is the 2nd time I have gone and my Salmon was browning. I used to go here before work every day because it was just the perfect place.

But twice in a row my (raw) fish is starting to brown is a bad sign."
Freshii (Thunder Bay),2,The service and the atmosphere was good. I got the Mediterranean bowl with chicken and a smoothie. I didn't like the taste of the Mediterranean bowl or the smoothie. The smoothie tasted more like honey than the fruits that were supposed to make up the smoothie. The chicken in my Mediterranean bowl tasted like it wasnt properly warmed. Also my sauce for the bowl was all down below my veggies. Honestly I didn't understand it.
Freshii (Thunder Bay),5,"Buddha bowl with steak is very good.
Shout out to Advy for excellent service -
Very fast , helpful, and with a smile."
Freshii (Thunder Bay),5,"If you want to eat healthy, try this place!  They have many different varieties of healthy salad bowls.  You can also get them as wraps and add protein to all of the bowls.  A group of five of us ordered 5 different bowls and found them all to be delicious.  The young ladies preparing the food were very friendly.  Although they offer delivery, I found it easy and convenient to pick up the food."
Freshii (Thunder Bay),1,Always liked Freshii as a franchise but I had a bad experience once at this location. The girl making my bowl had long claw nails poking through each finger of her gloves. When it came time to scoop avocado into my bowl she used her bare fake long nail as the spoon to do it ü§Æü§Æü§Æ not hygienic at all. So disgusting. Never went back after that.
Freshii (Thunder Bay),5,"Staff was amazing and the food was super fresh! Love how you can get boxes of fresh food delivered to the house too, very helpful when in a pinch. Highly recommend the metaboost salad/ wrap."
BarBurrito (Thunder Bay),1,"Year ago tried delivery from this location, food arrived ice cold! Tried it again today for take out, figured give it a second chance! What a waste of my time staff don't even listen. Asked for a spicy chicken bowl double meat! Counter staff asks whole wheat or white ?? I'm like I am ordering a BOWL!!! So she put on the rice then single meat and rest not even listened to the request! Only was billed for single but I wanted to buy double! The food was at least warm this time. But get some staff that actually listen before you lose more client's. I figured give a second chance, there won't be a third!!"
BarBurrito (Thunder Bay),5,"I recently had the opportunity to dine at a local establishment and was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food and service. The portions were generous, and the food itself was delicious, leaving me completely satisfied. The service was fast, ensuring that I didn't have to wait long for my meal.

One thing to note is that the portions are quite large, so those with smaller appetites may want to share a dish or save some for later. For those looking for a wide variety of options, the restaurant offers an extensive menu with a variety of dishes to choose from. Overall, I would highly recommend this establishment for their delicious food and efficient service"
BarBurrito (Thunder Bay),1,"Sadly said but Worst outside meal ever have :(
Ordered quesadilla and a wrap. Raw cheese, less toppings, not properly cooked. Asked to cook little bit more but her face expression was not good.
Bad customer service but not from all staff. Some staff was good"
BarBurrito (Thunder Bay),4,"Was really yummy! Tried it for the first time through skip the dishes. Burrito was very good, however the extra sour cream, salsa, and cheese I ordered was too little (has to use my own sour cream from home). Other than that, veggies were fresh, beans and rice were tasty. Good experience."
BarBurrito (Thunder Bay),1,"I respectfully urge you to taste your spicy chicken today. It is extremely awful in taste, super salty and has a rotten taste. I am not sure what happened, it used to much better than this. I had to throw it away, complete waste of hard earned money and meal. I am utterly disappointed. You can do better than this."
BeefCakes Burger Factory,5,"My. God. It was amazing! I tried the Mushroom Swiss Burger, and it was absolutely the best one in my life! The hot dog was the bigger size, not the smaller ones most restaurants use. The pricing is similar to fast food, so if you don't mind a tiny wait, it is absolutely worth it. The fries were tasty though not crispy enough, and weirdly the onion rings had the opposite effect, where they were too crispy to the point that it was difficult to bite into them (but when I did, it was also quite tasty). The service was awesome, they were accommodating and very nice to my daughter and I. Despite the minor complaints with the sides, I will definitely adopt this place as my burger go-to, and it did not take away from the positive experience I had! Thank you for the awesome lunch, guys!"
BeefCakes Burger Factory,5,"One of the best burgers in town, I fully recommend the Canadian one, amazing burger and the service was really great."
BeefCakes Burger Factory,5,Excellent service. Street parking. We had the plant based burgers and they were great!!
BeefCakes Burger Factory,5,"I had food for 10+ people delivered to an event that I hosted, and Beefcake‚Äôs did not disappoint! Everyone loved their food, especially their stacked burger fries!

The foods were definitely made with lots of love and detail to attention put to them. You can tell they did not rush or quickly made them as they were amazing in quality.

They were even kind enough to put each meals to the respective people at my event.

The courier was also early to deliver the foods as well, which was amazing. As well, the communication with the courier and the restaurant was very easy; the entire process from start to end flowed easily.

I highly recommend Beefcake‚Äôs; they won‚Äôt disappoint you."
BeefCakes Burger Factory,5,Awesome and friendly staff. Great food! They do not skimp on the fries!
Manchu Wok (1000 Fort William Road),2,"Very tiny portions. Even the rice. The chicken balls were gross, tiny, dry and overdone. It only gets a two because nothing beats their sweet and sour pork. But the pork still could have been cooked better."
Manchu Wok (1000 Fort William Road),4,"Located inside the Intercity shopping mall
We can do dine in but @ the mall dine in area like all other food places inside the mall.
Food is good and reasonable price when we try the combos.
Sometimes the quantity seems to be less which depends on the server helping you.
Some serves are nice and welcoming while some are really not that friendly always."
Manchu Wok (1000 Fort William Road),3,"It's fast food so it serves the purpose. Had a hankering for noodles to which I was glad to see a new batch being tossed as I arrived. Price is a bit high but then again, so is everything these days."
Manchu Wok (1000 Fort William Road),5,"Excellent customer service, food is deeeeelicious! Highly recommend!!"
Manchu Wok (1000 Fort William Road),5,Honestly I was so happy they were open in the mall after this long pandemic quarantine. It was a taste of things going back to normal and felt really nostalgic. üòä
"Pita Pit (500 Arthur St. West, Unit A)",4,"Stopped in for a pita, got a pita.  Communication issue with the cashier ended up with incorrect ingredients on the grill was corrected promptly when I pointed it out.  Food was good, service was passable and atmosphere was ok."
"Pita Pit (500 Arthur St. West, Unit A)",3,"I came in 10 min. before closing and there were two on staff duty. I know this isn't ideal, however my thought is if your hours are posted for a certain time than service will be provided until that time. I was surprised when one staff member tried to refuse serving me, saying that they stopped serving already and tried saying that it was 9pm (it wasn't). We went back and forth a little, but then the other staff member stepped in assuring me that it was okay and the small falafel pita can be made. The second employee ended up giving me good service and with a smile. The pita was good but again, I was surprised at the initial resistance to serve me."
"Pita Pit (500 Arthur St. West, Unit A)",5,"Excellent food, I had the grilled bbq steak pita and it was amazing. As far as pita pits go this one is pretty big and fancy / well decorated. Pricing is great (mine was $9.69). I'd recommend arriving before 11:30 for lunch as it can get busy. Staff were moving as quickly as possible and the restaurant has lots of them, the only bottle neck in my opinion was the customers choosing the contents of their pita (can't do much about that). Only complaint I have is some of the booth tables inside were a little messy but we just went to the tables instead. Overall I'd recommend this pita pit.
Edit: There is free wifi here too by the way!"
"Pita Pit (500 Arthur St. West, Unit A)",3,"This place is normally pretty good but this time around I preordered and not only was my order forgotten, they were kind of defensive about me asking about my order. And when they made it it was so saturated in sauce I could not eat it. Not sure if this was purposefully done because I inconvenienced them with making an order that I placed hours in advance. My partner‚Äôs pita out was fine but yeah mine was gross"
"Pita Pit (500 Arthur St. West, Unit A)",5,"I stopped in here for a quick bite to eat.  This was a good choice.  The options were good and the ability to customize your own pita was great.  The end result was very flavorful.  I found the small to be a bit small, granted I was hungry and hadn't eaten yet that day so if you are hungry, the small is probably not big enough.

The staff was friendly and helpful because I hadn't been to a Pita Pit before and wasn't quite sure of the process but they were great at helping me out."
Menchie's (Thunder Bay),4,"Frozen Yogurt place with tons of toppings to make it how you want it.
Downside was the watermelon slices were hard from sitting out for so long.

Cake batter, vanilla, and chocolate frozen yogurt were delicious!"
Menchie's (Thunder Bay),5,This is very good great milkshakes and great cheesecake also late hours
Menchie's (Thunder Bay),5,"I love Menchie's!
There sundaes are super delicious and very customizable to your liking.
The staff is superb, they're very polite and they put effort into there work!
Would recommend!"
Menchie's (Thunder Bay),5,Everything about Menchie's Thunder Bay is awesome.  The store is really clean and the staff are super friendly.  I really like the self-serve fro-yo bar   and the huge selection of toppings to make it just the way you want.  I have also been to a kids birthday party there and it was well organized by the staff and the kids had a blast.
Menchie's (Thunder Bay),5,My favorite dessert in the entire world I would recommend to anyone. There are great options for dairy free and other dietary specifics. Even during covid they are still doing amazing work.
The Brew Pub,3,"Waitress was wonderful and attentive, unfortunately the food didn't live up to the service. The ribs were dry and stuck to the bones, my chicken pasta was nothing to write home about and the cornbread was stale. All in all the Coleslaw that came as a side with the ribs was the best part of the actual meal.
Atmosphere was pleasant and again, wait staff was fantastic, too bad the food didn't measure up."
The Brew Pub,4,"14 craft taps and lots of variety in cans, plus knowledgeable staff means it's a great place to go for the beers.

I had higher hopes for the food though, it was just ok.  Brisket was dry, mac and cheese was gritty.

Games and darts to keep you occupied."
The Brew Pub,4,"The service was excellent - our server was attentive, she was helpful, she offered great suggestions and she made us feel welcomed; the atmosphere was awesome - we felt at ease and it was airy, not imposing at all. Felt great to be there!
The food was... Inconsistent. My meal was mostly excellent, my appetizer was great but my wife's meal was somewhat bland. It was like there were notes missing from each part of her meal. The food was not unpleasant but it also wasn't a smash out of the park. Maybe it was an off night and we will try again another day because the service was truly excellent."
The Brew Pub,5,5 star service by Jade on our visit today. Totally random pick of a restaurant turned into the best meal we had while visiting Thunder Bay. The tacos were excellent! Coleslaw was to die for and the Brisket & Blue sandwich was delish. Thank you Red Lion Smokehouse
The Brew Pub,4,"Food was amazing!! Service was very slow/intermittent, but they seemed understaffed the day we ate there. The servers were very apologetic, and compensated for the significant delays in food arriving which was very kind of them."
Island Spice Jerk House,5,"Trust mi. Food was amazing. I never expected top quality Jamaican food in Thunderbay. I had the stew Chicken with jerk chicken, plantain and festival. The stesm veggies and rice snd peas was done proper. The only drawback, no jerk pork is available on menu. Will definitely recommend...6 stars."
Island Spice Jerk House,4,"I had the oxtail and this is me finished it cause it‚Äôs good. Rice is yummy, I just don‚Äôt eat carbs much."
Island Spice Jerk House,5,"Food was dynamite,   the service was amazing very friendly  , the jerk chicken was one of the best I've had in along time, and the gravy was excellent..  plantains were just right ....highly recommend  you come try this place out...."
Island Spice Jerk House,4,"I ordered the Jerk chicken meal with steamed veggies and oxtail sauce. It was nice. I had it for lunch. The chicken was good. The rice portion was pretty great and sufficient. The steamed veggies were done nicely too. I didn't taste the oxtail sauce in my food so I'm pretty sure they must have forgotten to put it on it. Nevertheless, it was a decent meal."
Island Spice Jerk House,5,"So, I had delivered to myself the ""Irie Sample Feast. Options were: 4 Meats, Rice & Beans, Coleslaw & Steamed Vegetables, 4 Festivals, Roti, 2 Beef Patties. I chose: Curry Chicken, Oxtail, Curry Goat & Jerk Chicken. I wanted the Steamed Fish because it was recommended online, but I wasn't allowed. Next visit!

Curry Chicken (8.4/10). Not sure if it's the best I've had, but extremely close. No bones which I appreciated, but that makes it not authentic.

Curry Goat (8.2/10). Never had it. Would recommend it.

Oxtail (8.5/10). Had difficulty telling the difference between this and the Curry Goat embarrassingly, so I called someone. üòÖ Jamaicans don't curry oxtail I was told, so then I knew the difference. It was my first time and it tastes like a fatties roast beef that melts off the bone. I see the appeal.

Jerk Chicken (7.4/10). This score isn't reflected, by the fact I didnt get steamed fish. It was good, but unspectacular. Spices didn't stsnd out and I tasted mostly pepper. Wasn't bad at all, but was expecting more.

Steamed Vegetables (7.8/10). Was surprised and I could probably eat them straight which is something I normally wouldn't say.

Coleslaw (7/10). Meh, nothing to write home about.

Beef Patties (8.8/10). I had a homemade one of these years back and wasn't into them, but this was really good. The meat was almost pasty, but really good.

Festivals (8.4/10). Kind of like strips of bannock/sasass with sugar, but not sweat enough to be a donut. Was great for dipping.

Roti (8.5/10). Never had fresh Roti, but this was really good. Reminded me of a warm giant folded thicker tortilla. Great for dipping or eating straight.

Rice & Beans (7.9/10). Most commented thing online and was good, but I felt like I could make or have better. Wasn't something I'd seek out, but I'm glad I had it.

Mango Carrot Juice (8.1/10). It's a brand. Lots of sugar in it, but I don't think it. Good and would recommend.

I actually haven't finished all the food yet at the time of this review üòÖ, but I felt the need to comment fast due to the sheer amount that I likely won't finish in one sitting."
Vedic Foods,5,Very nice oasis of vedic culture.  Pleasing atmosphere.

Sushi Station,5,"I just dropped by the light crossingÔºåand saw this restaurant openÔºå on Easter Monday!!! Dragon Sushi is pretty Good. Avocado is one of my favourite. asparagus is not exact the same in the menu picture. but flavor is Good.If you love Asian food, sushi.station is a Good place to goq in thunderbay, where there seems not many authentic Asian food."
Sushi Station,5,"The best all-you-can-eat Sushi in Thunder Bay, they have great service and food. Service may be a little slower during busy hours, but it's worth it!"
Sushi Station,5,Locally owned and operated either dinner service. Wonderfully open atmosphere with booth style seating as well as bench and chair seating for larger groups. Happy and courteous staff that are accommodating and friendly. There is an unending stream of food delivery drivers sending out their finely crafted and delicious foods. You can order takeout boxes or have a seat in their dining area that has a capacity of about 30 to 40 customers. A tablet ordering system is used by the client during the dining experience that has each items caloric value and description.
Sushi Station,5,"Seven of us enjoyed the superb food and service.  You use an  iPad  and order a few items at a time from the all you can eat menu, then pass to another at our table. Items arrived within a few minutes of hitting send. No stress as we consumed our present choices,  knowing we will order additional food whenever.
This made the experience for all so relaxed.
Highly recommend eating at Sushi Station.
Donna"
Sushi Station,5,"Fantastic sushi! We ordered a tray of various rolls (dragon roll, California roll, salmon rolls and more) for takeout. Not a single miss on the entire tray. Everything was delicious!  Will definitely be going back."
SilverCity Thunder Bay Cinemas,5,"I‚Äôm someone who enjoys a light and simple diet and prefers foods cooked with fewer ingredients. So this Pho Nam perfectly satisfies my palate.
The soup is extremely delicious with light but rich flavor.
The beef is also very incredibly tender
I had twice of the same pho and I definitely will be back."
SilverCity Thunder Bay Cinemas,3,"It's our 1st time here and I ordered lunch special with beef n greens and my hubby ordered special wonton soup.

My food was okay. Big portion for 14.99 and for wonton soup special.  It was okay too, could be better if they use rice noodles and have pho spoon.

The place is clean and big."
SilverCity Thunder Bay Cinemas,3,"I would do 3.5 if possible, as it wasn‚Äôt horrible.
The pho broth was pretty tasty, the only disappointment was for the price there was barely any meat. I‚Äôm used to pho being loaded especially when you‚Äôre getting a mixture of meat types.
Lots of noodles.
The spring rolls were alright, also stingy on the meat (I didn‚Äôt get a photo) but I did appreciate that they split the order in two with two dipping bowls as we split the order and meant we could ‚Äúdouble dip‚Äù so to speak.
The place has a strange atmosphere. It‚Äôs very open, and when you walk in it seems like you‚Äôre walking into an establishment that is currently under construction. There‚Äôs an empty entry way, and you need to walk past it to get to the actual restaurant. It can give the impression it‚Äôs not open or there isn‚Äôt an active business.
Staff was friendly enough. Food arrived with a decent time.
I probably won‚Äôt return, as I‚Äôm not from the area. But it did the trick to soothe my Vietnamese cravings."
SilverCity Thunder Bay Cinemas,2,"First the good; the atmosphere seemed okay, the food didn't take too long to come out.
Now what you want to hear - the pho came with cilantro and not basil (she said they ""ran out"") and no hot peppers (good thing I brought my own).  The broth was barely passable, they were very stingy with the beef (for almost 20 bucks a bowl I felt swindled), and they don't have the proper spoons.  I know much of this sounds trivial, but it all adds up to a less than enjoyable experience.  Who has the word ""pho"" in their name and not have basil??
Also had the spring rolls, they were not terrible."
SilverCity Thunder Bay Cinemas,4,"Pretty cozy atmosphere! Service was a bit slow but it doesn't seem like there's a lot of people working, maybe 3. Very friendly staff.
When the food arrived, it was good. Good portion for price and with the pho there were lots of meat. Humble establishment, good food."
El Tres,5,This place is absolutely amazing. The staff are super knowledgeable and very friendly. The food is amazing. I have yet to try something I did not enjoy. Reasonably priced great for date night or group outings.
El Tres,5,We went for dinner there and the food was delicious! Loved the Mexican vibe and the paintings on the wall. Nick was our waiter and he was amazing & charming! We were about 12 and he did a great job explaining the meals to us and serving us! We all commented how great he was! We all enjoyed our food. I didn't get the picture of everyone's meals cos we dug in so quick so only got the picture of my meal. A note that my meal was a special as  that time so not sure it's on the regular menu.
El Tres,5,"You need to eat here. Best Mexican restaurant in town by far.

The food is amazing, the staff are incredible.

Nick was able to fit our party in on zero notice on a busy night. He explained the menu perfectly, the food came out fast, the drinks were amazing and the prices were reasonable.

I couldn't ask for a better experience. Nick, you made our night."
El Tres,5,"This place is our go to date night. We had a new waitress, she used to be a host (Julia). She was professional, friendly and attentive. She‚Äôs great and as always we had an excellent experience. The green couch is amazing will definitely be coming back to look at it but definitely will not sit on it 11/10"
El Tres,5,"MUCHO AMAZING!

Probably used that Spanish word wrong but this was very amazing - from the service to the food it was awesome!

Our server was fabulous - we saw on Instagram he won best server award in Thunder Bay this year that‚Äôs so cool but very well deserved he was excellent! Tentative, friendly, helpful, and made an excellent recommendation on the tequila!

Our food was also top notch! We only had drinks and appetizers but we will definitely be returning for meals!

Also appreciated the branding and overall look and feel of the place and even the down to the cute side plates! üëèüèº

We had such a great time here - would highly recommend!!"

Tim Hortons (390-398 Cumberland St North),1,"Today I bought caramel macchiato from this Tim and I got coffee instead. I payed 17 dollars in total for the food and drinks so I went back again and asked for the caramel macchiato again. They gave me the same coffee again, I have no clue if they know how to make it. Anyway.. the worst tims in Tbay in my opinionüëé"
Tim Hortons (390-398 Cumberland St North),3,I never see hairnets on employees at this location but they are super nice

Tim Hortons (390-398 Cumberland St North),1,"My order was steeped tea triple triple, it tasted like hot water in a cup, my friend asked for a mocha latte but got just latte, it was a still ok, but got the same hot watered steeped tea in the afternoon. Sitting area is great for everyone and plenty parking space"
Tim Hortons (390-398 Cumberland St North),5,Your usual tim Hortons. No different from all the other tim Hortons in Ontario.service was great and quick. I usually go through drive thru when I go there. Lines aren't long and drive thru service is quick.
Swiss Chalet  (879 Fort William Rd),1,So I was at the Thunder Bay store today for my 50th birthday and sharing it with my wife she asked where do you want to go I said Swiss Chalet because I love the deep fried perogies and the chicken dinners and buns also saw the coconut cream pie which is also a favourite. Ordered the drinks and when they came I started to order to find out nope we don‚Äôt have coconut cream pie or the perogies happy birthday to me right  now I have to choose something else because now I already have my drink great. Why is there none of this at the store this is what a managers job is correct to manage food so you don‚Äôt run out
Swiss Chalet  (879 Fort William Rd),5,"Honestly the staff was great. The food was SO good, delicious and so very well cooked! we got here right after church service on Sunday & the place filled up quickly after I took the pictures. The portions were quite decent and filling too. I had the Ribs + 5 wings (which comes with a side, dinner roll, coleslaw and dipping sauce) while my husband had the Quarter chicken dinner + chalet chicken soup + slice of pie which came with a choice of dessert. He had a lemon cake which I tasted as well. We will definitely be back."
Swiss Chalet  (879 Fort William Rd),2,"The last visit they forgot our appetizer, didn‚Äôt think lightening could strike twice. But here we go again. Our appetizer was forgotten.
How many chances do we give you. Service has declined not happy
Edited April 29th.  3rd try but today was the last time I will dine at Swiss chalet. Service is horrible. If we wanted McDonald‚Äôs service we‚Äôd go to McDonald‚Äôs"
Swiss Chalet  (879 Fort William Rd),4,"Lovely place to have Sunday brunch. It seemed they were understaffed but the staff still worked with a smile on their faces. Also, the food was good"
Swiss Chalet  (879 Fort William Rd),2,"Made an online order...from the time the restaurant listed the food as ready until the time it arrived was near half an hour (literally a 15 minute drive) The food was ice cold and parts of the order missing. I phoned the restaurant and ma currently on 9 minutes on hold
seems every delivery order is crewed up from this restaurant... am questioning why I continue to allow such poor customer service...not good value for the money"
The fastlane bar and grill,5,"I met the most beautiful woman there and went out on our first date, so awesome! The regulars and staff keeps you coming back. Bring your spouse or find one there. Food is very good. Great place to stop and feel comfortable. Az from Toronto."
The fastlane bar and grill,5,"Nice menu choices, great food and cheap prices. Waitress that served us went above and beyond serving us and everyone else in a timely fashion. Definately a must goto if in the area."
The fastlane bar and grill,2,"We called for takeout, it took much longer than they told us. The place was empty except two people who had their food. The girl behind the bar was impersonal, short and unfriendly. Food was a 4 out of 10, and very small portioned. Would not recommend."
The fastlane bar and grill,3,"The Fast Lane Bar and Grill is a nice destination for watching sports, quality food and daily drink specials. Their menu offers a wide variety of delicious meals that will satisfy your hunger. You can start with a loaded plate of Nachos, or try their signature Fastlane Burger, Smoking Stampede Grilled Chicken and Fastlane Big Breakfast! They have very friendly staff. The ambiance could do with a little more light."
The fastlane bar and grill,1,Rather disappointed. Used ‚ÄúSkipTheDishes‚Äù (which is an AMAZING app) to order from Fastlane. It took 1.5hrs for the food to be ready (according to the app). However when we received the food it was freezing cold. Which makes me feel that the kitchen staff told the driver to wait. My partner and I were up all night sick to our stomach. Would not recommend to anyone.
Royal Aleppo Food,5,Top rank just for bringing this menu to this city. A street food gem. St. Paul street food scene throws down. Had chicken sandwich Shawarma. Hit the spot. Take the time to really read that menu.
Royal Aleppo Food,5,"This is one of my absolutely favourite places to eat. The food is amazing, the owners and staff are super friendly, it's just an amazing experience overall. Their vegetarian plate is delicious with lots of different goodies, their falafel is flavourful and the perfect blend of moist and crispy, their hummus and baba ganoush is the best I've ever had. We also love their donair, rice, stuffed vine leaves, rice pudding, baklava... we've never had anything we've disliked. Highly recommend them. We go pretty much once a week.  They also have curbside pick up (great for social distancing!) and they offer delivery now."
Royal Aleppo Food,5,"Have never been disappointed with the Shawarma Wraps from Royal Aleppo (especially the chicken shawarma wraps).
I ordered two massive boxes of Shawarma family platters which comes with your choice of chicken, donair or falafel wraps!!
Needless to say all the guests enjoy the food.
Additionally, i happened to mention that the wraps are for a birthday party and they were nice enough to include a birthday message for the birthday boy!!
Definitely recommend this local family restaurant to everyone in or visiting thunder bay"
Royal Aleppo Food,5,"In this place you will find such a great service from the ladies. The experience is very authentic, delicious food and very good prices from what you get.  Totally recommended."
Royal Aleppo Food,5,"By far the best shawarma place in Thunder Bay. Great food, prices and an amazing friendly staff! Highly recommended!"
"Subway (1072 Oliver Rd, 1)",2,"Went in, place was really slow today. As I was in yesterday for work and was busier. No additional flavours of bread available‚Ä¶. They also didn‚Äôt have lettuce, when I asked expecting that maybe they had run out, market shortage or what not. I was informed individual working had not prepped any and didn‚Äôt have time to prep. I believe I was the only one on there as the last two people sitting there were there for long enough to eat and be finished and said it was dead to me as I walked in. As normally it‚Äôs not like this for this location"
"Subway (1072 Oliver Rd, 1)",2,"Staff packaged up the sub before asking if I wanted to add toppings. I explained this to the woman working the till, but she did not offer to unwrap and add toppings to the sub."
"Subway (1072 Oliver Rd, 1)",2,"06/21 6:45pm Long queue. Single person working during such a busy supper time. Food quality, taste and cleanliness on point."
"Subway (1072 Oliver Rd, 1)",1,"Totally rubbish ‚Ä¶
Staff is too rude .. she cut  our veggie sub with the same knife with which she cut Bacon just few seconds ago ‚Ä¶ Not cleaning the board or any other equipments..
when I asked every restaurant have different policies for veggie and non veggie food  .. she denied the thing and replied subway have Nothing for Veggie lovers ..  we can‚Äôt do anything ..
worst experience ever
There was no option for ‚ÄúZero star ‚Äú"
"Subway (1072 Oliver Rd, 1)",1,Staying at Day Inn. Decided to go get a subs. Staff was extremely rude and ignorant.  Had to ask for a bag because we were walking. She was not impressed. Not a person in store but felt like I was imposing on her.
Wild Thyme,5,"Food never let me down for the taste or price. I haven‚Äôt had all their drinks but the ones I‚Äôve had are great. Staff are wonderful people, they always seem happy and nice. This spot definitely deserves some more attention"
Wild Thyme,5,"Ohhhhh myyyy! Had the raspberry cheesecake with white chocolate on top. This, by far, was the best cheesecake I‚Äôve ever had‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm no spring chicken! Tried a couple of the 16 beers on tap. Very tasty and ice cold (had a brown ale and a blonde). My son had the rib special. Of course, I had to try some. The ribs were fall off the bone tender. Well spiced and a delicious sauce to top it off. Will definitely stop here the next time in town! Delicious!"
Wild Thyme,5,Absolutely a great business that is nice and lounge like. The bartenders care about your experience and make sure you are happy. They frequently come out with amazing unique drinks and great food. One of my new favorite places. Thankyou Wild Thyme. Keep it up!
Wild Thyme,4,"Pizza and wings were absolutely delicious! The wait was short too. The staff was friendly and lit a candle for us. However, the server didn't state the special of the day (which had I known I would have ordered it) and no non alcoholic beverages (except water) was on the menu."
Wild Thyme,5,"This is an amazing place to eat at. The staff were wonderful, the menu was packed and the atmosphere was just great. Went as part of a group and everything was just 5 stars.... I definitely recommend!!!"
McDonald's (Arthur St),5,"Quick service, food was ok. They probably have better coffee than Tim Horton."
McDonald's (Arthur St),1,"Downloaded their app and sent customer service an email asking how to unsubscribe from the thousands of emails every day for food I will never eat. Instead of replying to the email, they just deleted my account completely. Didn't let me know they were doing it either, just all of a sudden my account didn't exist and points I had were all wiped out. Won't be downloading the app again if it means a bunch of emails I don't want and that's extremely poor customer ""service"" in my opinion. If I could rate 0 stars I would have"
McDonald's (Arthur St),3,Typical fast food. Fries are always either cold or as hot as the sun. Drive-through always tells you to pull over and they eventually bring the food to your car. Pleasant service.
McDonald's (Arthur St),1,Old lady does not like kids. Will not go here again due to her ignorance towards my son. 3 year olds get excited when they come here and she continues to have ignorant remarks towards children. Not the first time I have seen this.
McDonald's (Arthur St),1,"So this is the third time in the past fee months that my orders have been so messed up. I could not understand the girl at the drive through, it's unfortunate but the accent was too thick. I got my order and it wasn't placed properly so I had to go inside and it still ain't placed properly because the guy at the till had minimal communication in English. Not a pleasant experience to start the day. Highly would not recommend."
Boston Pizza (Thunder Bay),5,This place has great pizza loved it. I recommend the cheesy bread
Boston Pizza (Thunder Bay),5,Came in for pizza üçï and ended up with garlic shrimp mac and cheese. Very happy trying BP for the first time. Maybe next jaunt into CA I'll try the pizza. Thx for the good service too. üòÄ
Boston Pizza (Thunder Bay),3,"I really like the food here; however, the service is terrible more than half time I go here.

Going to stop giving 20-30% tips for now on.

Would be nice to just pick my order give the cooks a $20 tip each time"
Boston Pizza (Thunder Bay),1,Very bad experience last night . Ordered dinner and some drinks go to pay and the server Carly f. Told us to tip her cause she pays ten bucks for the table we were dinning at. I was gonna tip her but not after that experience. Afterwards she kept giving me and my family dirty looks. We attend this bp regularly but not after last nights experience.
Boston Pizza (Thunder Bay),4,This location was very clean and great friendly service. I would give it a 5 but honestly boston pizza is making all their food too peppery ruining a lot of it. Bandera bread was amazing though.
Pizza Hut (707 Memorial Ave.),3,"I struggled to understand the accent of the person taking our order, and though she said ""bone in or boneless"" three times exactly the same it really didn't help but eventually my daughters friend figured it out.
One of our pizzas was supposed to be half  pepperoni but they missed that completely.
Other than that the food was very tasty."
Pizza Hut (707 Memorial Ave.),1,"Lady at the front told me, her recipe for tomato is only this much, super rude, never coming back"
Pizza Hut (707 Memorial Ave.),5,The place is on the main road and probably very fast at the orders. The pizza delieverd to us was fresh and colour and taste was also good  and Wow wow wow it's the first time that I tried pizza hut . I ordered the pan chicken ceasar and it is sooooo good and crispy!!! The guy who handled the pizza today was very polite and nice. Definitely will come back! Thank you üòä
Pizza Hut (707 Memorial Ave.),3,Has gotten  better since they got rid of thre whities and repalced them with Indian people.
Pizza Hut (707 Memorial Ave.),1,"Original service was amazing but after I called back to ask a question someone else answered and were very abrupt and rude. After they provided an answer of no I said ok, no worries, have a great night and they cut me off in the middle of my sentence. That is not how you treat a customer and I‚Äôm speaking as someone who works for a restaurant and deals with customers all day. Needs work. I can accept no as an answer but not rude customer service in return"
Goodlife Foods Co.,1,"I have ordered from this place online a decent amount of times. But I went in person yesterday. We stood at the order counter for 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged our existence (not a big deal it was 6:30) then when we ordered were told ‚Äúthat is going to take a long time, like 10 minutes‚Äù like? Okay? I still want it. We order our second item and are told ‚ÄúI have to check if we have the ingredients‚Äù so he never moves from where he‚Äôs standing and asks what we wanted again then we say. We go find our table and another 45 minutes go by and the person that was behind us in line gets served first (no big deal we ordered the ‚Äò10 minute‚Äô item) however the person that was in front of us was still waiting. So on to the food, we ordered the beef raider burrito. Now correct me if I am wrong, but something called a beef raider should have beef it, this burrito was 90%rice 7%veggies 2%sauce and 1% beef. When went went up to complain we told told that he‚Äôd make a new one, at this point it is just us in here and not even the skip noise has gone off. We waited another 25 minutes for this burrito and when I turned and looked no one was making it. The Azteka salad, this is the only thing I have ever eaten here, I love it, it‚Äôs delicious was still delicious when I ate it yesterday, this is the item were were originally told they needed to see if all of the ingredients were there for it. Because they weren‚Äôt, the salad comes with feta cheese Parmesan was added. We ended up leaving without the burrito."
Goodlife Foods Co.,5,"Indian and Mexican fusion finally.   The service was great and the menu has a huge selection of burritos,  bowls, salads tacos and family dinners.   I had a paneer taco and it was amazing.   Price was decent,  49$ to feed 4 adults."
Goodlife Foods Co.,3,"They have some of the East Indian foods including Dosa(masala dosa),
Burrito bowl either with butter chicken or veg options like butter paneer.
The food is good and the price is really reasonable.
If we are goin for burrito bowl, there is not wait time at all, but if you are ordering dosa try ti gibe them a call and order ahead to avoid waiting"
Goodlife Foods Co.,1,"I ordered samosas and they were awful literally drenched in oil , there was lots of oil inside them , i would never eat here again"
Goodlife Foods Co.,5,"Came across on our travels while searching skip for gluten free options. This place had also been previously recommended by family that used to live here. They have the most amazing salad selection I‚Äôve ever seen! Everything on the menu looks amazing. I opted for the vibrant venus salad and was not disappointed. Extremely large potion, generous on the protein.
Would highly recommend !!"
KFC (2013 Arthur Street East),3,The food was ok. I got a lunch box. The packaging wasnt great and looked really rushed but the food was good. I mean it's fast food so it's good and I'll be back. I liked the zinger burger and potato salad.
KFC (2013 Arthur Street East),4,"It's been more than 15 years when I stopped buying KFC so I decided to go and try the chicken bacon sandwich and it was really good. 4 Stars because cleaning should be more taken care of. As every single table was dirty. I took the most ""decent one"" fries are good and coleslaw. Service was fast."
KFC (2013 Arthur Street East),5,"I had some speedy service today at the house that Sanders built. Cheap and fast order. I love KFC gravy, so I got a bucket of that with my double big stack chicken burger, small popcorn chicken and a large order of fries.
Obviously not the place for vegetarian or vegans. There is limited indoor dining, or place and order online for pickup or delivery."
KFC (2013 Arthur Street East),1,"Was there today and decided to dine in since there was no one in the store. What a mistake, at least four employees working but the store was disgusting. Two bites out of my ‚Äútwister‚Äù and lost my appetite so through out my lunch, in an overflowing garbage. The floor, drink machine and tables were absolutely disgusting. Imagine what the kitchen looks like. Where are the owners or at the very least management?"
KFC (2013 Arthur Street East),1,"Paid over $70.00 for 2 Big Crunch stackers, small popcorn chicken, 2 poutines and 9 chicken tenders, we got all the way home and we were missing a stacker and the popcorn chicken. Do better at checking the orders before you dish them out, we wasted gas going all the way back to get the rest of our food."
Robin's (300 May Street S),5,"The woman at the till is an incredibly kind soul and I love the food and drinks there. They have great sandwiches, donuts and coffee. This is my favourite place to get coffee. Much better than Tim Hortons. 5 stars deserved. Thank you for the great experience. :)"
Robin's (300 May Street S),5,My dogs appreciate the treats and the people serving me. They have yet to bark at any of my fellow workers. That says everything to me
Robin's (300 May Street S),5,Coffee is always the right strength and sugar and cream amounts on point. Unlike the other location.
Robin's (300 May Street S),5,"Stopped in at Robins and enjoyed a delicious Nanaimo bar! Freshly made, light sugar, not too sweet, just right. The bottom was coconut crumbleüëå"
Robin's (300 May Street S),5,Always hit up a Robin's when I'm on the city.  Good coffee and donuts. Lady at the Window was friendly
Wendy's (950 Memorial Avenue),4,"Nice and clean place to grab a fast meal.
Very fast service, tasty food fresh and hot.

The main problem is that the front door wheelchair accessibility doesn't work! And some employees don't understand what we ask ..

Plus be aware they got B from the health unit."
Wendy's (950 Memorial Avenue),3,"Kids ordered frostys they had change and used it, Im Assuming it was the manager or supervisor who came to the window and told us next time we need at least a 10.00 bill it came to 16.00. Was 13.00 in loonies and quarters rest Dimes and nickles I could see if there was a line up but there wasn't plus we waited at least 8 min or more for our stuff. And it's kids for goodness sakes one with a disability.  The girl at the take out window was very kind tho and apologized for taking so long."
Wendy's (950 Memorial Avenue),1,I guess do to labour shortage. N Canada's  immigration  policy we the people who live here have to lower our standards  because it seems this restaurant  is lowering its standards. Hiring hard to understand  staff. Who seem like they hate there  job n have 0 personality  when it comes to service  i hope elon makes robots soon cus robots  can be properly  programmed.  The pic. Is a fly someone  stuck to the  glass at my table. If i saw it!!! Staff are completely  blind or dont care. I find it sad u call this fast food. No line up at the  till  n i waited 10 mins for a 1 star burger. Im only able to lower my standards  to what they are now any lower n ill be eating out of the  dumpster  out back. Its probably  cleaner then inside.
Wendy's (950 Memorial Avenue),1,"Tempurature is +32¬∞C at the time of review. The lobby smelled of urine, there was no AC in the lobby and most of the tables were dirty. The food was OK at best, the frostys were basically chocolate milk, ice machine was broken, pop fountain in the lobby was out of order and the fountain for drive thru which was serving the whole restaurant had a broken ice maker and there was 0 carbonation, there was no condiments available to guests other than ketchup packets. Overall abismal dine in experience and evidence suggests a similar experience for drive thru customers."
Wendy's (950 Memorial Avenue),5,"Got a free lovely breakfast today. Seems like new product coming up. Really tasty, fresh as always. Love Wendy's, excellent staff, excellent company."
Monsoon Indian Cuisine,5,Amazing variety in the buffet for a great price! The restaurant was clean and inviting. Service was great as well.
Monsoon Indian Cuisine,4,"Great experience goin there for dine in.
Went for a dinner on a Sunday eve and the server who was the only one on the day, helped really good and was really friendly.
Food didnt take any long and the food was really good.
Tried lamb biriyani, beef biriyani and nan with palak paneer and chilli chicken.
Everything was tasty.
I had also tried their buffet which only happens on pirticular days a week and thats a good proce too.
Overall a great indian food experience."
Monsoon Indian Cuisine,5,"Every food item individually well-packaged came in uber eats . with the dishes, I received complementary rice.
The rotis and garlic naan were delicious. Malai kofta and daal tadka were Less spicy, but equally delicious,"
Monsoon Indian Cuisine,5,Food has a very authentic taste and portion sizes are huge. Very reasonable prices. Would definitely try it again.
Monsoon Indian Cuisine,4,"It was so good! We got the monsoon papa chicken, butter chicken, chana masala, naan platter, samosas, and gulab jamun. The portions were moderate‚Äî they weren‚Äôt super big, and the price was okay (ranging from $17-20 for bigger dishes, and $6-9 for the side dishes). It was super flavourful‚Äî we ordered mild-medium spiciness level, and it was good for us! Definitely would come back üî•üî•üî•"
Curry Up Now,2,"Bought ""burrito bowl"" today around 3pm-4pm
*The yellow rice was dry i wasn't abel to chew.
*The chicken tikka which they gave me it was just gravy, found 2 slice of chicken inside the gravy(really unfair).
*the chicken was overcooked

*The taste wasn't good.

About my previous orders around 1am-3am morning ""burrito bowl"" doesn't remember the dates.

>butter chicken was nice had lot of chicken pieces.
> good portion was served.
> the rice was good.
>everything was perfect.

Will give a try someday, if had a bad exp again than you will loss a customer."
Curry Up Now,2,"Ordered chicken biryani. The overall portion size was good but the portion of chicken is very small. And I am giving this review as I have tried other Indian restaurants that were able to maintain a standard. I did not like the quality of rice. It was overcooked and mushy. Did not feel like restaurant quality. Except for the heat coming from spices, the biryani's taste was bland. Indian cuisine in Thunder Bay is expensive. I expect everything to be top notch at that price. This was disappointing. I'll rather order from other Indian restaurant next time. P.S: It was an online order through Skip the dishes app."
Curry Up Now,5,"Edit: Came here again, got the Naughty Butter Chicken Chaat. So I can handle the spice, since the flavour is SOO GOOD. This dish is amazing! Well done! Wish it were less spicy on my baby tongue still. The samosas in butter chicken sauce are amazing.

TOO SPICY! Every time I order from them their butter chicken is different. Container/Portion size, Spicy-ness please be consistent and less spicy. Samosas, Rice and Gulab Jamun are yummy though."
Curry Up Now,1,"Just an hour back today I.e 31/01/2024 ordered 2 chicken biryani's over the phone for pickup around 12:45pm and I told the lady I'll come in 10 mins and pickup my order. They said ok it will be ready. When I went in there biryani's were not ready and she was telling me that biryani is under process it will take  10 more mins, I said it's ok and waited till 10 mins and went in to pick up my order. When I picked up my order the biryani's were cold and then I understood that biryani was last night's leftovered one. I came home and unpacked the biryani. The quantity was less and the chicken pieces were very dry. Their services are very poor and the lady who served me is the owner of the restaurant. The owner itself is doing like this means how the restaurant runs well. I think she is feeling proud that none of the Indian restaurants do well in Thunder Bay except her restaurant."
Curry Up Now,3,"I honestly love the food here, i order it a bunch from skip the dishes, unfortunately i was eating my food and enjoying it until I found a long thin hair stuck in my basmati rice. I was repulsed. I understand that happens sometimes but thats why hair nets are a thing. Ill still or order from here but if that happens again I will not anymore."
Taco Time (679 Memorial Avenue),2,Ordered a beef and cheese burrito...  received 1 with lettuce tomatoes.. white stuff... not good.  Won't be driving 10 miles to bring back...  never again Tt.
Taco Time (679 Memorial Avenue),5,"The staff was amazing! Even when another customer was impatient and demanding their food they all stayed calm and professional, got the man's food an continued to attend to the rest of the guests!
Great service"
Taco Time (679 Memorial Avenue),5,Great service. Fast food tacos at their finest.  Clean dining room.   Never disappoint.
Taco Time (679 Memorial Avenue),5,Tried it before but not the restaurant more like a fast food booth tried and didn't like.  The restaurant was a way better experience food was great and place was clean.
Taco Time (679 Memorial Avenue),5,They make good tacos and have Taco Tuesday which is when they sell tacos for $2.
Pho Umami,5,"I‚Äôm someone who enjoys a light and simple diet and prefers foods cooked with fewer ingredients. So this Pho Nam perfectly satisfies my palate.
The soup is extremely delicious with light but rich flavor.
The beef is also very incredibly tender
I had twice of the same pho and I definitely will be back."
Pho Umami,3,"It's our 1st time here and I ordered lunch special with beef n greens and my hubby ordered special wonton soup.

My food was okay. Big portion for 14.99 and for wonton soup special.  It was okay too, could be better if they use rice noodles and have pho spoon.

The place is clean and big."
Pho Umami,3,"I would do 3.5 if possible, as it wasn‚Äôt horrible.
The pho broth was pretty tasty, the only disappointment was for the price there was barely any meat. I‚Äôm used to pho being loaded especially when you‚Äôre getting a mixture of meat types.
Lots of noodles.
The spring rolls were alright, also stingy on the meat (I didn‚Äôt get a photo) but I did appreciate that they split the order in two with two dipping bowls as we split the order and meant we could ‚Äúdouble dip‚Äù so to speak.
The place has a strange atmosphere. It‚Äôs very open, and when you walk in it seems like you‚Äôre walking into an establishment that is currently under construction. There‚Äôs an empty entry way, and you need to walk past it to get to the actual restaurant. It can give the impression it‚Äôs not open or there isn‚Äôt an active business.
Staff was friendly enough. Food arrived with a decent time.
I probably won‚Äôt return, as I‚Äôm not from the area. But it did the trick to soothe my Vietnamese cravings."
Pho Umami,2,"First the good; the atmosphere seemed okay, the food didn't take too long to come out.
Now what you want to hear - the pho came with cilantro and not basil (she said they ""ran out"") and no hot peppers (good thing I brought my own).  The broth was barely passable, they were very stingy with the beef (for almost 20 bucks a bowl I felt swindled), and they don't have the proper spoons.  I know much of this sounds trivial, but it all adds up to a less than enjoyable experience.  Who has the word ""pho"" in their name and not have basil??
Also had the spring rolls, they were not terrible."
Pho Umami,4,"Pretty cozy atmosphere! Service was a bit slow but it doesn't seem like there's a lot of people working, maybe 3. Very friendly staff.
When the food arrived, it was good. Good portion for price and with the pho there were lots of meat. Humble establishment, good food."
Kelseys (805 Memorial Ave),5,Went there with a large group of people for a birthday celebration. Our server Kodi It was incredible. He was engaging and entertaining and took care of our table very efficiently. It was a great experience!  Great food and great atmosphere.
Kelseys (805 Memorial Ave),4,"Had an amazing time this last time. Our servers are always friendly. And, the food is always fresh. It has a lot of TVs near the bar for you to view and a lot of sports games/ programming to view depending on where you want to sit. Wide selection of beverage options. The only low calorie options seem to be water and diet coke. They have a great selection of specialty drinks for you to choose from. The menu had everything from bar food burgers and nachos. To steak fish and salads. As well as pasta dishes. I really enjoyed the lunch special trio bbq chicken sandwich, soup broccoli chedder, and salad. The salad was amazing. It had feta, dried berries, raisens, tomateos, onion with nuts, in spring mix with a special vinaigrette. Will for sure want the soup and salad again in the future. On other occasions. I had the swiss mushroom burger, onion rings, and the spinach dip. The burger was some what ok, the onion rings were great but small as portion, and the spinach dip was great, with fried peta to dip in it."
Kelseys (805 Memorial Ave),5,"Kodie was our server and he was unreal! I have celiac disease and he took the extra time to make sure that my meal was safe to eat with the kitchen (salmon), and I felt confident in this. He also had a great energy, was super friendly and attentive. Great experience! I‚Äôll be coming back for sure."
Kelseys (805 Memorial Ave),5,"Good food, great drinks and excellent customer service. Kodie was friendly, checked in on us more than a few times. Always makes the experience more enjoyable!"
Kelseys (805 Memorial Ave),2,"We were there when the power went out. After being there for an hour,  we had the choice of leaving or having our dinner with cold fries and barely warm everything else, so we chose to stay.  Seeimg that our orders were going to he thrown out, I thought we might get a break on the bill. Our drinks were free, we had water and one gravy wasn't charged for.  The Cajun chicken wings had no spice at all, just a greasy taste. So much for our evening out. We tried ti fill out the survey but we didn't get a proper bill because the POWER WAS OUT. We have a handwritten bill with no date just the total so we couldn't give a ticket  number.  Do  no survey"
A&W (526 Memorial Ave),1,I went with someone in a wide wheelchair. The ramp is not flush with the ground and the doors are not on buttons. So people had to hold doors. There was not enough space for me to open the second door to fit through and get buy at the same time. Very poorly set up
A&W (526 Memorial Ave),5,"Fast food, but good food. Consistent with what I expect from A&W"
A&W (526 Memorial Ave),2,"What happened to your Beyond Burger.
I used to love it, but the last two times it was like mush!
Are you microwaving it or what?"
A&W (526 Memorial Ave),5,So i am in love!! With the frozen rootbeer with cream shake! I live out of town about 3 hours to the nearest town and often travel there for app and what not . So i didcivered these delisouse delights and vowed to come back one day and this time id buy 10 no 20!! Well the next week i honored ny promise and hit up the first place i seen ( this one) and low and behond their machine was down:( no for real :( i then drove around to about 3 other a and ws idk but alot till finally the last one i was gonna try had a working machine!! Haalaloya it was a festivfus miracle i screamed. But ya back to this place i was happy with the shake first visit even tho food was not even room temp when i was literally only person there so how long does this food sit to get below room temp? Your guesse is as good as mine thank god i got iron guts .but i have to knock off points because its so so unacceotable to have your machine down for 2 visits now? And i have a sneaking suspicion its not down just workers to lazy to clean it lol
A&W (526 Memorial Ave),5,"Great burgers, nice employees. I wish the burger patties were juicer tho.
And, the small juice glass is weird looking."
Salween Restaurant,5,"I loved it! It was delicious! I ordered the Cashew Stirfry and it was perfect, lots of delicious vegetables and the shrimp was so good! I have zero complaints, I had a great experience, the food is great. Big serving sizes too! Made a great dinner."
Salween Restaurant,5,Located in what appears to be a more outdated part of town but the food is still delicious. A bit on the mild side compared to other Thai restaurants which is fine for those who don't like it spicy. Portion sizes are great with very reasonable prices. I would definitely recommend this to any visitors to Thunder Bay.
Salween Restaurant,5,"Super yummy foods! We were going to Toronto and drove by this place. We ordered all five different items on the menu and they were all so good! I would like to suggest to the white folks, get out of your comfort zone and try different menus other than ‚ÄúPad Thai‚Äù. If you want to try one of these menus, you can just show them the following pictures! I‚Äôm definitely returning if I‚Äôm ever going to drive by Thunder Bay. Satisfaction level is 100% üëçüèºüëçüèºüëåüèºüëåüèº"
Salween Restaurant,5,"A gem in thunder bay! Burmese cuisine is difficult to find and this restaurant had such a great selection of dishes. Had the tea leaf salad and tum carrot salad, both were really delicious. Would definitely return if I pass through TB again!"
Salween Restaurant,5,"The food was delicious and there were three dishes and spring rolls ordered!
We will be ordering from there again! Absolutely delicious and the portions were great!"
Little Caesars (Arthur St W),1,"My boyfriend use to work here. I got banned from bringing him in his beverage (I'd get a drink when he started from my job at Shoppers, next door) to keep him hydrated for the day. The boss only favored her children who she hired to only work there, she treated her children awfully
If you EVER complain about them and they know you, get ready to be banned for life. lol"
Little Caesars (Arthur St W),1,If your going to make up your own hours and close at random times  at least update your hours on Google first so people don't show up to a locked up and closed location on a day that is not a holiday.
Little Caesars (Arthur St W),5,Picked up a couple pizzas for our trip home a few hours away. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and recieved very friendly service. There wasn't a Hawaiian in the warmer so the assistant manager fired one up for us and it was done up very fast. All of the staff was very professional and the storefront was very clean. From what I could see the back was tidy as well. This is a great place to grab a quick and affordable pizza when your on the go. Very tasty and fresh ingredients. Thanks a bunch and look forward to stopping in again!
Little Caesars (Arthur St W),1,I placed a large order online and there was items missing and they don't answer there phone. Thats hooked up to a facts machine.
Little Caesars (Arthur St W),4,Can't relay complain much. You get what you order. Their fast and cheap. Kids love it and that's all that matters to me most days.
Macao Imperial Tea (Thunder Bay),3,I was unimpressed with the quality and flavors of the food I purchased. Beef dishes were watery and tasteless. Rice was soggy. Vegetable dishes were bland. Chicken balls were hard and tough meat. The service was pleasant. The atmosphere is homey. 3 out of 5 is generous.
Macao Imperial Tea (Thunder Bay),5,"Very good service and food. Only drawback is the seats ( benches) are mot very comfortable.  We didn't sit and  chat  after the meal. Also, one of my favourite meals is Singapore noodles  however, you cannot order a single serving.  Only a meal for 2. Strange."
Macao Imperial Tea (Thunder Bay),5,Always very friendly service both on the phone and when you enter. Food is excellent. Great prices and a dinner will last me 3 meals lol.
Macao Imperial Tea (Thunder Bay),1,"(I rarely write bad reviews but I had to share for those ordering delivery).
Sorry I tried to like it, but worst chinese food and most expensive I have ordered.
Temperature was good and the service was fast as I was told it was busy.  The egg rolls and chicken balls were ok but the garlic ribs were tiny bits with a lot of hard pieces. Chicken fried rice tasteless.  Wonton soup had it's own taste, not the regular taste of a wonton soup.  Ate the stock of the soup but threw the rest in the garbage including the ribs, and rest of rice.  TOO BAD to throw it out since the trio plate at 17.95$, 2 egg rolls (7$), and a soup (7.75$), added up to 45,80$.  Hard to understand the bill but had like 10$+ of extra fees.  With the tip it added up to 53.80$ for a plate, soup and 2 egg rolls.  I understand that taste can be subjective, but all the added fees should have been told and explained to the customer."
Macao Imperial Tea (Thunder Bay),5,So good! Best egg rolls in town! Superb service and excellent food.
The Bannock Lady,5,I‚Äôm new to Thunder Bay and was happy to see The Bannock Lady sign.  On my first visit I tried the Bannock Hotdog‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.yummmmy!  I have since had the balongna sandwich and the bannock hamburger and have been pleased with it all.  Each item is delicious and very filling as well as very well priced.  A great meal for a great price:)
The Bannock Lady,1,"At the CLE fair, I had ordered bannock burgers. The blonde woman handling money was putting the food together, too. No gloves, no hand washing, whatsoever. The burger was so bland, I waited more than half an hour in line, then only noticed she was handling money and making the food after ordering.  I spent too much for a bland burger and stood too long in line, and I‚Äôm not one to make a scene. So, I hoped for the best, only to have an upset stomach. Do better, you‚Äôre going to make more people sick."
The Bannock Lady,5,Awesome!!!  Delish! Generous portions at a low price!!  Totally recommend
The Bannock Lady,1,"I had terrible food poisoning.. :(( Ordered the Indian Taco Deluxe, it was kind of bland, not much seasoning on the meat. I've had better. At 2:00AM, I suffered for it and ended up vomitting because my stomach was in too much pain even with the pepto and tums I was taking. I would not recommend eating here ever. The Indian Taco Deluxe should be more like The Indian Taco Disaster.."
The Bannock Lady,5,I would definitely go back to this establishment again
Tokyo House,5,"They have come a long way in quality. The food is a bit pricey but it's all you can eat seafood, it's not cheap. They have a great selection of rolls, and even with the language barrier they are still very courteous. I highly recommend you try their Hawaiian roll while you're there. Very overlooked but a phenomenal balance of sweet and savory. My go to place for sushi in thunder bay now."
Tokyo House,5,"We really enjoyed Tokyo House. The sushi was good and the service was great despite having a sign posted that they were short staffed. The place was clean and had a nice ambiance. My favourite was the summer roll (pictured with the kiwi on top), very sweet with unexpected ingredients. Would definitely recommend this place."
Tokyo House,5,"Some of the best sushi I've had, great quality and very well made. The restaurant is fantastic, you get up to 3 orders for AYCE. ""Expensive items"" such as butter fish and salmon sashimi are limited to 10pc per person per visit. The staff is very kind, this place is well worth the visit üíØ"
Tokyo House,3,"Overall the food was pretty good, would definitely go again, but I advise being prepared for a long time to wait for your orders to come in as they only had two people in the kitchen, and two people serving, one being the manager who also sat us. The restaurant itself was not that busy, they have signs up stating they‚Äôre only allowed to have five tables at a time due to their shortage of staff. So of course the wait time is to be expected, but not to the extent it was. Overall would go again, but only every once in a while as the dinner for all - you - can - eat for adults was $39.75 per person."
Tokyo House,5,"Great service and servers, friendly staff! The fish was amazing - fresh and well assembled sushi and sashimi. The other dishes were great as well and all came through timely."
Montana's (Thunder Bay),5,Great Montana's well kept. Attentive staff. Good food. Fun mod was to change the chicken tacos to bang bang shrimp.
Montana's (Thunder Bay),5,"Stopped in here during my travels through Thunder Bay and was very happy with the experience.  The food and atmosphere were very good and the service was amazing.  The server wrote her name as Hayley.  She was very friendly, smiled throughout my stay there and gave a good suggestion when I asked what's good even though it was busy.  Buttermilk Fried Chicken for the win!  Thanks Hayley and Montana's in Thunder Bay, will definitely stop in next time through town!"
Montana's (Thunder Bay),4,"Went in last weekend. Server basically forgot about our table. Kiddo never got his drink, plates were never removed from the table. Had to ask for the kids dessert about 3 times. Server spent a lot of time chatting with her other table. Poor time management or too many tables. Spinach dip was good tho!"
Montana's (Thunder Bay),5,"Went for a late supper after a very long day and the staff was amazing and fast with service. This is especially from our server Eve who was kind, courteous and funny. Would definitely recommend visiting due to the friendly atmosphere and enjoyable food experience."
Montana's (Thunder Bay),5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Montana's and I must say, it was an exceptional experience. From the moment I walked in, Bryannah, our server, provided us with outstanding service that was both nice and caring. Her attentiveness and commitment to ensuring our dining experience was top-notch were truly commendable.

Bryannah's warm and friendly demeanor made us feel welcome right away. She took the time to explain the menu and made excellent recommendations based on our preferences. Her knowledge of the dishes and willingness to accommodate our dietary needs was impressive. It was evident that she genuinely cared about our satisfaction and went above and beyond to ensure we had a memorable meal.

Throughout the evening, Bryannah remained attentive without being intrusive. She always had a smile on her face and promptly attended to any requests or questions we had. Her efficiency and professionalism were truly remarkable, and it made the overall dining experience even more enjoyable.

One piece of advice I would give to those considering dining at Montana's is to visit mid-week. During our visit, the restaurant was relatively quiet, allowing Bryannah to provide personalized attention to each table. It was evident that the mid-week atmosphere allowed the staff to focus more closely on their guests, resulting in an even more delightful dining experience.

In terms of the food, Montana's did not disappoint. The menu offered a wide range of mouth-watering options, and the quality of the dishes was superb. From the succulent ribs to the perfectly cooked steaks, every bite was a delight to the taste buds. The portions were generous, and the presentation was visually appealing.

Overall, my experience at Montana's was exceptional, and much of that credit goes to Bryannah for her exceptional service. Her friendly and caring nature, coupled with her attention to detail, truly elevated our dining experience. I highly recommend visiting Montana's and, if you have the opportunity, being served by Bryannah. Just remember, for the best experience, try to visit mid-week when the restaurant is less crowded. You won't be disappointed"
Bliss,5,"Oh my what an amazing spot.  I've been to lots of vegan/plant based, gluteen free spot and can say for sure this spot is dynamite.  The cookies and sweets were fresh, full and huge.  Tons of hot sauces, frozen meals to go.  They have a scotch bonnet jam that my friend and I polished off in 2 days.  Best hot jam/sauce ever.  Amazing.  The ladies were very kind and made us feel right at home.  Everyone needs to give those place some love."
Bliss,5,"Teena and Lynn at Bliss did an amazing job at catering our wedding for us! The gluten-free and vegan platters were a huge hit. So many of our friends were grateful to be able to enjoy and indulge at our wedding. The wedding cake was spectacular! People are still raving about it even weeks after our wedding! The support, service and quality provided to us by the team at Bliss was above and beyond our expectations. We cannot recommend them enough! Thank you so much for being a part of our special day!"
Bliss,5,"Teena and Lynn exceeded all our expectations as caterers for our wedding. From the very beginning, they were so helpful with planning- from arranging tastings, to discussing options and accepting feedback. There was no guesswork because there was clear and consistent communication. The day of the wedding, Teena was wonderful with delivery and set up and even gave us a hand with a few other things that needed to be done. The food was delicious and the presentation was beautiful. All our guests loved it! I cannot thank them both enough for all their hard work. I will definitely recommend Bliss to others in the future!"
Bliss,5,"Wow! A shop with all vegan / plant based things! Amazing!! Loveedd the ‚Äútwix‚Äù bar!

Very impressed with their creativity to create delicious things for all the dietary restrictions yet still make them look so good and taste taste good too!

Can‚Äôt wait to try other items on their menu!

And the artwork with the b incorporated was just sooo beautiful!"
Bliss,5,"My favourite restaurant is open again!!!
They have new items and old favs. All gluten free, vegan, refined sugar free.
I got the jalape√±o ""cheddar"" veggie burger, charcuterie bowl, ginger cookie and Twix bar.

All are SO good and you'd hardly know they're vegan. Love to have fresh options in TBay.

They also do pizza, variety of burgers, bowls, treats... they'll be having smoothies and bulk items, grab and go salads, meal kits etc etc.

I am in no way affiliated just a loyal customer haha."
Edo Japan -  Brentwood Village,4,"It was really fast, affordable, friendly and great service. I loved their menu. Just a lot of fantastic and easy to choose from. They had a lot of variety. From sushi to soups to cooked meals (Rice meals, noodle meals, Bento boxes) to starters etc. I was craving sushi last night so I went there to order their Easi Sushi Platter. I loved it. So delicious. I cannot wait to try their other meals. I am so sure this place will become a staple for my takeout meals."
Edo Japan -  Brentwood Village,5,"I recently visited Edo Japan to try their veggie sushi and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm smile from the staff and a welcoming atmosphere. The restaurant had a modern and clean feel, which immediately made me feel comfortable."
Edo Japan -  Brentwood Village,5,"Fast and friendly service. I was greeted as if i were Norm walking into Cheers.
This is the type of fast food I should be eating. Japanese cuisine that is delicious and prepared quickly.
Wheelchair accessible parking and entrance. Prices are fair and the teriyaki sauce is some of the best I‚Äôve ever tasted. I‚Äôm not the biggest sushi fan, but I am a massive stir fry supporter.
Kids menu and vegetarian items are also available."
Edo Japan -  Brentwood Village,5,"I get takeout from here regularly. And I it‚Äôs nothing fancy, but it‚Äôs always good.
I recommend the spring rolls, and chicken and beef rice bowl with two scoops of teriyaki sauce. Order ahead of time on their app because they‚Äôre usually quite busy."
Edo Japan -  Brentwood Village,3,"Not Bad sushi at all. Honestly a place I prefer to go to for a quick sushi pickup. Staff is Friendly and the food is great, but This is the 2nd time I have gone and my Salmon was browning. I used to go here before work every day because it was just the perfect place.

But twice in a row my (raw) fish is starting to brown is a bad sign."
Freshii (Thunder Bay),2,The service and the atmosphere was good. I got the Mediterranean bowl with chicken and a smoothie. I didn't like the taste of the Mediterranean bowl or the smoothie. The smoothie tasted more like honey than the fruits that were supposed to make up the smoothie. The chicken in my Mediterranean bowl tasted like it wasnt properly warmed. Also my sauce for the bowl was all down below my veggies. Honestly I didn't understand it.
Freshii (Thunder Bay),5,"Buddha bowl with steak is very good.
Shout out to Advy for excellent service -
Very fast , helpful, and with a smile."
Freshii (Thunder Bay),5,"If you want to eat healthy, try this place!  They have many different varieties of healthy salad bowls.  You can also get them as wraps and add protein to all of the bowls.  A group of five of us ordered 5 different bowls and found them all to be delicious.  The young ladies preparing the food were very friendly.  Although they offer delivery, I found it easy and convenient to pick up the food."
Freshii (Thunder Bay),1,Always liked Freshii as a franchise but I had a bad experience once at this location. The girl making my bowl had long claw nails poking through each finger of her gloves. When it came time to scoop avocado into my bowl she used her bare fake long nail as the spoon to do it ü§Æü§Æü§Æ not hygienic at all. So disgusting. Never went back after that.
Freshii (Thunder Bay),5,"Staff was amazing and the food was super fresh! Love how you can get boxes of fresh food delivered to the house too, very helpful when in a pinch. Highly recommend the metaboost salad/ wrap."
BarBurrito (Thunder Bay),1,"Year ago tried delivery from this location, food arrived ice cold! Tried it again today for take out, figured give it a second chance! What a waste of my time staff don't even listen. Asked for a spicy chicken bowl double meat! Counter staff asks whole wheat or white ?? I'm like I am ordering a BOWL!!! So she put on the rice then single meat and rest not even listened to the request! Only was billed for single but I wanted to buy double! The food was at least warm this time. But get some staff that actually listen before you lose more client's. I figured give a second chance, there won't be a third!!"
BarBurrito (Thunder Bay),5,"I recently had the opportunity to dine at a local establishment and was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food and service. The portions were generous, and the food itself was delicious, leaving me completely satisfied. The service was fast, ensuring that I didn't have to wait long for my meal.

One thing to note is that the portions are quite large, so those with smaller appetites may want to share a dish or save some for later. For those looking for a wide variety of options, the restaurant offers an extensive menu with a variety of dishes to choose from. Overall, I would highly recommend this establishment for their delicious food and efficient service"
BarBurrito (Thunder Bay),1,"Sadly said but Worst outside meal ever have :(
Ordered quesadilla and a wrap. Raw cheese, less toppings, not properly cooked. Asked to cook little bit more but her face expression was not good.
Bad customer service but not from all staff. Some staff was good"
BarBurrito (Thunder Bay),4,"Was really yummy! Tried it for the first time through skip the dishes. Burrito was very good, however the extra sour cream, salsa, and cheese I ordered was too little (has to use my own sour cream from home). Other than that, veggies were fresh, beans and rice were tasty. Good experience."
BarBurrito (Thunder Bay),1,"I respectfully urge you to taste your spicy chicken today. It is extremely awful in taste, super salty and has a rotten taste. I am not sure what happened, it used to much better than this. I had to throw it away, complete waste of hard earned money and meal. I am utterly disappointed. You can do better than this."
BeefCakes Burger Factory,5,"My. God. It was amazing! I tried the Mushroom Swiss Burger, and it was absolutely the best one in my life! The hot dog was the bigger size, not the smaller ones most restaurants use. The pricing is similar to fast food, so if you don't mind a tiny wait, it is absolutely worth it. The fries were tasty though not crispy enough, and weirdly the onion rings had the opposite effect, where they were too crispy to the point that it was difficult to bite into them (but when I did, it was also quite tasty). The service was awesome, they were accommodating and very nice to my daughter and I. Despite the minor complaints with the sides, I will definitely adopt this place as my burger go-to, and it did not take away from the positive experience I had! Thank you for the awesome lunch, guys!"
BeefCakes Burger Factory,5,"One of the best burgers in town, I fully recommend the Canadian one, amazing burger and the service was really great."
BeefCakes Burger Factory,5,Excellent service. Street parking. We had the plant based burgers and they were great!!
BeefCakes Burger Factory,5,"I had food for 10+ people delivered to an event that I hosted, and Beefcake‚Äôs did not disappoint! Everyone loved their food, especially their stacked burger fries!

The foods were definitely made with lots of love and detail to attention put to them. You can tell they did not rush or quickly made them as they were amazing in quality.

They were even kind enough to put each meals to the respective people at my event.

The courier was also early to deliver the foods as well, which was amazing. As well, the communication with the courier and the restaurant was very easy; the entire process from start to end flowed easily.

I highly recommend Beefcake‚Äôs; they won‚Äôt disappoint you."
BeefCakes Burger Factory,5,Awesome and friendly staff. Great food! They do not skimp on the fries!
Manchu Wok (1000 Fort William Road),2,"Very tiny portions. Even the rice. The chicken balls were gross, tiny, dry and overdone. It only gets a two because nothing beats their sweet and sour pork. But the pork still could have been cooked better."
Manchu Wok (1000 Fort William Road),4,"Located inside the Intercity shopping mall
We can do dine in but @ the mall dine in area like all other food places inside the mall.
Food is good and reasonable price when we try the combos.
Sometimes the quantity seems to be less which depends on the server helping you.
Some serves are nice and welcoming while some are really not that friendly always."
Manchu Wok (1000 Fort William Road),3,"It's fast food so it serves the purpose. Had a hankering for noodles to which I was glad to see a new batch being tossed as I arrived. Price is a bit high but then again, so is everything these days."
Manchu Wok (1000 Fort William Road),5,"Excellent customer service, food is deeeeelicious! Highly recommend!!"
Manchu Wok (1000 Fort William Road),5,Honestly I was so happy they were open in the mall after this long pandemic quarantine. It was a taste of things going back to normal and felt really nostalgic. üòä
"Pita Pit (500 Arthur St. West, Unit A)",4,"Stopped in for a pita, got a pita.  Communication issue with the cashier ended up with incorrect ingredients on the grill was corrected promptly when I pointed it out.  Food was good, service was passable and atmosphere was ok."
"Pita Pit (500 Arthur St. West, Unit A)",3,"I came in 10 min. before closing and there were two on staff duty. I know this isn't ideal, however my thought is if your hours are posted for a certain time than service will be provided until that time. I was surprised when one staff member tried to refuse serving me, saying that they stopped serving already and tried saying that it was 9pm (it wasn't). We went back and forth a little, but then the other staff member stepped in assuring me that it was okay and the small falafel pita can be made. The second employee ended up giving me good service and with a smile. The pita was good but again, I was surprised at the initial resistance to serve me."
"Pita Pit (500 Arthur St. West, Unit A)",5,"Excellent food, I had the grilled bbq steak pita and it was amazing. As far as pita pits go this one is pretty big and fancy / well decorated. Pricing is great (mine was $9.69). I'd recommend arriving before 11:30 for lunch as it can get busy. Staff were moving as quickly as possible and the restaurant has lots of them, the only bottle neck in my opinion was the customers choosing the contents of their pita (can't do much about that). Only complaint I have is some of the booth tables inside were a little messy but we just went to the tables instead. Overall I'd recommend this pita pit.
Edit: There is free wifi here too by the way!"
"Pita Pit (500 Arthur St. West, Unit A)",3,"This place is normally pretty good but this time around I preordered and not only was my order forgotten, they were kind of defensive about me asking about my order. And when they made it it was so saturated in sauce I could not eat it. Not sure if this was purposefully done because I inconvenienced them with making an order that I placed hours in advance. My partner‚Äôs pita out was fine but yeah mine was gross"
"Pita Pit (500 Arthur St. West, Unit A)",5,"I stopped in here for a quick bite to eat.  This was a good choice.  The options were good and the ability to customize your own pita was great.  The end result was very flavorful.  I found the small to be a bit small, granted I was hungry and hadn't eaten yet that day so if you are hungry, the small is probably not big enough.

The staff was friendly and helpful because I hadn't been to a Pita Pit before and wasn't quite sure of the process but they were great at helping me out."
Menchie's (Thunder Bay),4,"Frozen Yogurt place with tons of toppings to make it how you want it.
Downside was the watermelon slices were hard from sitting out for so long.

Cake batter, vanilla, and chocolate frozen yogurt were delicious!"
Menchie's (Thunder Bay),5,This is very good great milkshakes and great cheesecake also late hours
Menchie's (Thunder Bay),5,"I love Menchie's!
There sundaes are super delicious and very customizable to your liking.
The staff is superb, they're very polite and they put effort into there work!
Would recommend!"
Menchie's (Thunder Bay),5,Everything about Menchie's Thunder Bay is awesome.  The store is really clean and the staff are super friendly.  I really like the self-serve fro-yo bar   and the huge selection of toppings to make it just the way you want.  I have also been to a kids birthday party there and it was well organized by the staff and the kids had a blast.
Menchie's (Thunder Bay),5,My favorite dessert in the entire world I would recommend to anyone. There are great options for dairy free and other dietary specifics. Even during covid they are still doing amazing work.
The Brew Pub,3,"Waitress was wonderful and attentive, unfortunately the food didn't live up to the service. The ribs were dry and stuck to the bones, my chicken pasta was nothing to write home about and the cornbread was stale. All in all the Coleslaw that came as a side with the ribs was the best part of the actual meal.
Atmosphere was pleasant and again, wait staff was fantastic, too bad the food didn't measure up."
The Brew Pub,4,"14 craft taps and lots of variety in cans, plus knowledgeable staff means it's a great place to go for the beers.

I had higher hopes for the food though, it was just ok.  Brisket was dry, mac and cheese was gritty.

Games and darts to keep you occupied."
The Brew Pub,4,"The service was excellent - our server was attentive, she was helpful, she offered great suggestions and she made us feel welcomed; the atmosphere was awesome - we felt at ease and it was airy, not imposing at all. Felt great to be there!
The food was... Inconsistent. My meal was mostly excellent, my appetizer was great but my wife's meal was somewhat bland. It was like there were notes missing from each part of her meal. The food was not unpleasant but it also wasn't a smash out of the park. Maybe it was an off night and we will try again another day because the service was truly excellent."
The Brew Pub,5,5 star service by Jade on our visit today. Totally random pick of a restaurant turned into the best meal we had while visiting Thunder Bay. The tacos were excellent! Coleslaw was to die for and the Brisket & Blue sandwich was delish. Thank you Red Lion Smokehouse
The Brew Pub,4,"Food was amazing!! Service was very slow/intermittent, but they seemed understaffed the day we ate there. The servers were very apologetic, and compensated for the significant delays in food arriving which was very kind of them."
Island Spice Jerk House,5,"Trust mi. Food was amazing. I never expected top quality Jamaican food in Thunderbay. I had the stew Chicken with jerk chicken, plantain and festival. The stesm veggies and rice snd peas was done proper. The only drawback, no jerk pork is available on menu. Will definitely recommend...6 stars."
Island Spice Jerk House,4,"I had the oxtail and this is me finished it cause it‚Äôs good. Rice is yummy, I just don‚Äôt eat carbs much."
Island Spice Jerk House,5,"Food was dynamite,   the service was amazing very friendly  , the jerk chicken was one of the best I've had in along time, and the gravy was excellent..  plantains were just right ....highly recommend  you come try this place out...."
Island Spice Jerk House,4,"I ordered the Jerk chicken meal with steamed veggies and oxtail sauce. It was nice. I had it for lunch. The chicken was good. The rice portion was pretty great and sufficient. The steamed veggies were done nicely too. I didn't taste the oxtail sauce in my food so I'm pretty sure they must have forgotten to put it on it. Nevertheless, it was a decent meal."
Island Spice Jerk House,5,"So, I had delivered to myself the ""Irie Sample Feast. Options were: 4 Meats, Rice & Beans, Coleslaw & Steamed Vegetables, 4 Festivals, Roti, 2 Beef Patties. I chose: Curry Chicken, Oxtail, Curry Goat & Jerk Chicken. I wanted the Steamed Fish because it was recommended online, but I wasn't allowed. Next visit!

Curry Chicken (8.4/10). Not sure if it's the best I've had, but extremely close. No bones which I appreciated, but that makes it not authentic.

Curry Goat (8.2/10). Never had it. Would recommend it.

Oxtail (8.5/10). Had difficulty telling the difference between this and the Curry Goat embarrassingly, so I called someone. üòÖ Jamaicans don't curry oxtail I was told, so then I knew the difference. It was my first time and it tastes like a fatties roast beef that melts off the bone. I see the appeal.

Jerk Chicken (7.4/10). This score isn't reflected, by the fact I didnt get steamed fish. It was good, but unspectacular. Spices didn't stsnd out and I tasted mostly pepper. Wasn't bad at all, but was expecting more.

Steamed Vegetables (7.8/10). Was surprised and I could probably eat them straight which is something I normally wouldn't say.

Coleslaw (7/10). Meh, nothing to write home about.

Beef Patties (8.8/10). I had a homemade one of these years back and wasn't into them, but this was really good. The meat was almost pasty, but really good.

Festivals (8.4/10). Kind of like strips of bannock/sasass with sugar, but not sweat enough to be a donut. Was great for dipping.

Roti (8.5/10). Never had fresh Roti, but this was really good. Reminded me of a warm giant folded thicker tortilla. Great for dipping or eating straight.

Rice & Beans (7.9/10). Most commented thing online and was good, but I felt like I could make or have better. Wasn't something I'd seek out, but I'm glad I had it.

Mango Carrot Juice (8.1/10). It's a brand. Lots of sugar in it, but I don't think it. Good and would recommend.

I actually haven't finished all the food yet at the time of this review üòÖ, but I felt the need to comment fast due to the sheer amount that I likely won't finish in one sitting."

Sushi Station,5,"I just dropped by the light crossingÔºåand saw this restaurant openÔºå on Easter Monday!!! Dragon Sushi is pretty Good. Avocado is one of my favourite. asparagus is not exact the same in the menu picture. but flavor is Good.If you love Asian food, sushi.station is a Good place to goq in thunderbay, where there seems not many authentic Asian food."
Sushi Station,5,"The best all-you-can-eat Sushi in Thunder Bay, they have great service and food. Service may be a little slower during busy hours, but it's worth it!"
Sushi Station,5,Locally owned and operated either dinner service. Wonderfully open atmosphere with booth style seating as well as bench and chair seating for larger groups. Happy and courteous staff that are accommodating and friendly. There is an unending stream of food delivery drivers sending out their finely crafted and delicious foods. You can order takeout boxes or have a seat in their dining area that has a capacity of about 30 to 40 customers. A tablet ordering system is used by the client during the dining experience that has each items caloric value and description.
Sushi Station,5,"Seven of us enjoyed the superb food and service.  You use an  iPad  and order a few items at a time from the all you can eat menu, then pass to another at our table. Items arrived within a few minutes of hitting send. No stress as we consumed our present choices,  knowing we will order additional food whenever.
This made the experience for all so relaxed.
Highly recommend eating at Sushi Station.
Donna"
Sushi Station,5,"Fantastic sushi! We ordered a tray of various rolls (dragon roll, California roll, salmon rolls and more) for takeout. Not a single miss on the entire tray. Everything was delicious!  Will definitely be going back."
SilverCity Thunder Bay Cinemas,5,"I‚Äôm someone who enjoys a light and simple diet and prefers foods cooked with fewer ingredients. So this Pho Nam perfectly satisfies my palate.
The soup is extremely delicious with light but rich flavor.
The beef is also very incredibly tender
I had twice of the same pho and I definitely will be back."
SilverCity Thunder Bay Cinemas,3,"It's our 1st time here and I ordered lunch special with beef n greens and my hubby ordered special wonton soup.

My food was okay. Big portion for 14.99 and for wonton soup special.  It was okay too, could be better if they use rice noodles and have pho spoon.

The place is clean and big."
SilverCity Thunder Bay Cinemas,3,"I would do 3.5 if possible, as it wasn‚Äôt horrible.
The pho broth was pretty tasty, the only disappointment was for the price there was barely any meat. I‚Äôm used to pho being loaded especially when you‚Äôre getting a mixture of meat types.
Lots of noodles.
The spring rolls were alright, also stingy on the meat (I didn‚Äôt get a photo) but I did appreciate that they split the order in two with two dipping bowls as we split the order and meant we could ‚Äúdouble dip‚Äù so to speak.
The place has a strange atmosphere. It‚Äôs very open, and when you walk in it seems like you‚Äôre walking into an establishment that is currently under construction. There‚Äôs an empty entry way, and you need to walk past it to get to the actual restaurant. It can give the impression it‚Äôs not open or there isn‚Äôt an active business.
Staff was friendly enough. Food arrived with a decent time.
I probably won‚Äôt return, as I‚Äôm not from the area. But it did the trick to soothe my Vietnamese cravings."
SilverCity Thunder Bay Cinemas,2,"First the good; the atmosphere seemed okay, the food didn't take too long to come out.
Now what you want to hear - the pho came with cilantro and not basil (she said they ""ran out"") and no hot peppers (good thing I brought my own).  The broth was barely passable, they were very stingy with the beef (for almost 20 bucks a bowl I felt swindled), and they don't have the proper spoons.  I know much of this sounds trivial, but it all adds up to a less than enjoyable experience.  Who has the word ""pho"" in their name and not have basil??
Also had the spring rolls, they were not terrible."
SilverCity Thunder Bay Cinemas,4,"Pretty cozy atmosphere! Service was a bit slow but it doesn't seem like there's a lot of people working, maybe 3. Very friendly staff.
When the food arrived, it was good. Good portion for price and with the pho there were lots of meat. Humble establishment, good food."
El Tres,5,This place is absolutely amazing. The staff are super knowledgeable and very friendly. The food is amazing. I have yet to try something I did not enjoy. Reasonably priced great for date night or group outings.
El Tres,5,We went for dinner there and the food was delicious! Loved the Mexican vibe and the paintings on the wall. Nick was our waiter and he was amazing & charming! We were about 12 and he did a great job explaining the meals to us and serving us! We all commented how great he was! We all enjoyed our food. I didn't get the picture of everyone's meals cos we dug in so quick so only got the picture of my meal. A note that my meal was a special as  that time so not sure it's on the regular menu.
El Tres,5,"You need to eat here. Best Mexican restaurant in town by far.

The food is amazing, the staff are incredible.

Nick was able to fit our party in on zero notice on a busy night. He explained the menu perfectly, the food came out fast, the drinks were amazing and the prices were reasonable.

I couldn't ask for a better experience. Nick, you made our night."
El Tres,5,"This place is our go to date night. We had a new waitress, she used to be a host (Julia). She was professional, friendly and attentive. She‚Äôs great and as always we had an excellent experience. The green couch is amazing will definitely be coming back to look at it but definitely will not sit on it 11/10"
El Tres,5,"MUCHO AMAZING!

Probably used that Spanish word wrong but this was very amazing - from the service to the food it was awesome!

Our server was fabulous - we saw on Instagram he won best server award in Thunder Bay this year that‚Äôs so cool but very well deserved he was excellent! Tentative, friendly, helpful, and made an excellent recommendation on the tequila!

Our food was also top notch! We only had drinks and appetizers but we will definitely be returning for meals!

Also appreciated the branding and overall look and feel of the place and even the down to the cute side plates! üëèüèº

We had such a great time here - would highly recommend!!"

Tim Hortons (390-398 Cumberland St North),1,"My order was steeped tea triple triple, it tasted like hot water in a cup, my friend asked for a mocha latte but got just latte, it was a still ok, but got the same hot watered steeped tea in the afternoon. Sitting area is great for everyone and plenty parking space"
Tim Hortons (390-398 Cumberland St North),5,Your usual tim Hortons. No different from all the other tim Hortons in Ontario.service was great and quick. I usually go through drive thru when I go there. Lines aren't long and drive thru service is quick.
Swiss Chalet  (879 Fort William Rd),1,So I was at the Thunder Bay store today for my 50th birthday and sharing it with my wife she asked where do you want to go I said Swiss Chalet because I love the deep fried perogies and the chicken dinners and buns also saw the coconut cream pie which is also a favourite. Ordered the drinks and when they came I started to order to find out nope we don‚Äôt have coconut cream pie or the perogies happy birthday to me right  now I have to choose something else because now I already have my drink great. Why is there none of this at the store this is what a managers job is correct to manage food so you don‚Äôt run out
Swiss Chalet  (879 Fort William Rd),5,"Honestly the staff was great. The food was SO good, delicious and so very well cooked! we got here right after church service on Sunday & the place filled up quickly after I took the pictures. The portions were quite decent and filling too. I had the Ribs + 5 wings (which comes with a side, dinner roll, coleslaw and dipping sauce) while my husband had the Quarter chicken dinner + chalet chicken soup + slice of pie which came with a choice of dessert. He had a lemon cake which I tasted as well. We will definitely be back."
Swiss Chalet  (879 Fort William Rd),2,"The last visit they forgot our appetizer, didn‚Äôt think lightening could strike twice. But here we go again. Our appetizer was forgotten.
How many chances do we give you. Service has declined not happy
Edited April 29th.  3rd try but today was the last time I will dine at Swiss chalet. Service is horrible. If we wanted McDonald‚Äôs service we‚Äôd go to McDonald‚Äôs"
Swiss Chalet  (879 Fort William Rd),4,"Lovely place to have Sunday brunch. It seemed they were understaffed but the staff still worked with a smile on their faces. Also, the food was good"
Swiss Chalet  (879 Fort William Rd),2,"Made an online order...from the time the restaurant listed the food as ready until the time it arrived was near half an hour (literally a 15 minute drive) The food was ice cold and parts of the order missing. I phoned the restaurant and ma currently on 9 minutes on hold
seems every delivery order is crewed up from this restaurant... am questioning why I continue to allow such poor customer service...not good value for the money"
The fastlane bar and grill,5,"I met the most beautiful woman there and went out on our first date, so awesome! The regulars and staff keeps you coming back. Bring your spouse or find one there. Food is very good. Great place to stop and feel comfortable. Az from Toronto."
The fastlane bar and grill,5,"Nice menu choices, great food and cheap prices. Waitress that served us went above and beyond serving us and everyone else in a timely fashion. Definately a must goto if in the area."
The fastlane bar and grill,2,"We called for takeout, it took much longer than they told us. The place was empty except two people who had their food. The girl behind the bar was impersonal, short and unfriendly. Food was a 4 out of 10, and very small portioned. Would not recommend."
The fastlane bar and grill,3,"The Fast Lane Bar and Grill is a nice destination for watching sports, quality food and daily drink specials. Their menu offers a wide variety of delicious meals that will satisfy your hunger. You can start with a loaded plate of Nachos, or try their signature Fastlane Burger, Smoking Stampede Grilled Chicken and Fastlane Big Breakfast! They have very friendly staff. The ambiance could do with a little more light."
The fastlane bar and grill,1,Rather disappointed. Used ‚ÄúSkipTheDishes‚Äù (which is an AMAZING app) to order from Fastlane. It took 1.5hrs for the food to be ready (according to the app). However when we received the food it was freezing cold. Which makes me feel that the kitchen staff told the driver to wait. My partner and I were up all night sick to our stomach. Would not recommend to anyone.
Royal Aleppo Food,5,Top rank just for bringing this menu to this city. A street food gem. St. Paul street food scene throws down. Had chicken sandwich Shawarma. Hit the spot. Take the time to really read that menu.
Royal Aleppo Food,5,"This is one of my absolutely favourite places to eat. The food is amazing, the owners and staff are super friendly, it's just an amazing experience overall. Their vegetarian plate is delicious with lots of different goodies, their falafel is flavourful and the perfect blend of moist and crispy, their hummus and baba ganoush is the best I've ever had. We also love their donair, rice, stuffed vine leaves, rice pudding, baklava... we've never had anything we've disliked. Highly recommend them. We go pretty much once a week.  They also have curbside pick up (great for social distancing!) and they offer delivery now."
Royal Aleppo Food,5,"Have never been disappointed with the Shawarma Wraps from Royal Aleppo (especially the chicken shawarma wraps).
I ordered two massive boxes of Shawarma family platters which comes with your choice of chicken, donair or falafel wraps!!
Needless to say all the guests enjoy the food.
Additionally, i happened to mention that the wraps are for a birthday party and they were nice enough to include a birthday message for the birthday boy!!
Definitely recommend this local family restaurant to everyone in or visiting thunder bay"
Royal Aleppo Food,5,"In this place you will find such a great service from the ladies. The experience is very authentic, delicious food and very good prices from what you get.  Totally recommended."
Royal Aleppo Food,5,"By far the best shawarma place in Thunder Bay. Great food, prices and an amazing friendly staff! Highly recommended!"
"Subway (1072 Oliver Rd, 1)",2,"Went in, place was really slow today. As I was in yesterday for work and was busier. No additional flavours of bread available‚Ä¶. They also didn‚Äôt have lettuce, when I asked expecting that maybe they had run out, market shortage or what not. I was informed individual working had not prepped any and didn‚Äôt have time to prep. I believe I was the only one on there as the last two people sitting there were there for long enough to eat and be finished and said it was dead to me as I walked in. As normally it‚Äôs not like this for this location"
"Subway (1072 Oliver Rd, 1)",2,"Staff packaged up the sub before asking if I wanted to add toppings. I explained this to the woman working the till, but she did not offer to unwrap and add toppings to the sub."
"Subway (1072 Oliver Rd, 1)",2,"06/21 6:45pm Long queue. Single person working during such a busy supper time. Food quality, taste and cleanliness on point."
"Subway (1072 Oliver Rd, 1)",1,"Totally rubbish ‚Ä¶
Staff is too rude .. she cut  our veggie sub with the same knife with which she cut Bacon just few seconds ago ‚Ä¶ Not cleaning the board or any other equipments..
when I asked every restaurant have different policies for veggie and non veggie food  .. she denied the thing and replied subway have Nothing for Veggie lovers ..  we can‚Äôt do anything ..
worst experience ever
There was no option for ‚ÄúZero star ‚Äú"
"Subway (1072 Oliver Rd, 1)",1,Staying at Day Inn. Decided to go get a subs. Staff was extremely rude and ignorant.  Had to ask for a bag because we were walking. She was not impressed. Not a person in store but felt like I was imposing on her.
Wild Thyme,5,"Food never let me down for the taste or price. I haven‚Äôt had all their drinks but the ones I‚Äôve had are great. Staff are wonderful people, they always seem happy and nice. This spot definitely deserves some more attention"
Wild Thyme,5,"Ohhhhh myyyy! Had the raspberry cheesecake with white chocolate on top. This, by far, was the best cheesecake I‚Äôve ever had‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm no spring chicken! Tried a couple of the 16 beers on tap. Very tasty and ice cold (had a brown ale and a blonde). My son had the rib special. Of course, I had to try some. The ribs were fall off the bone tender. Well spiced and a delicious sauce to top it off. Will definitely stop here the next time in town! Delicious!"
Wild Thyme,5,Absolutely a great business that is nice and lounge like. The bartenders care about your experience and make sure you are happy. They frequently come out with amazing unique drinks and great food. One of my new favorite places. Thankyou Wild Thyme. Keep it up!
Wild Thyme,4,"Pizza and wings were absolutely delicious! The wait was short too. The staff was friendly and lit a candle for us. However, the server didn't state the special of the day (which had I known I would have ordered it) and no non alcoholic beverages (except water) was on the menu."
Wild Thyme,5,"This is an amazing place to eat at. The staff were wonderful, the menu was packed and the atmosphere was just great. Went as part of a group and everything was just 5 stars.... I definitely recommend!!!"
Manoir du spaghetti,5,Fabulous experience. I was greeted warmly and it wasn't a problem I was a single older woman. My server was friendly and responsive. The food - sublime! I ordered mushroom ravioli. The pillows were tender and the sauce smooth and rich. A delightful combination. I highly recommend a dining experience at Le Manoir Spaghetti. üòé
Manoir du spaghetti,3,"The food was quite nice. I liked the way they prepared their scallops, there was a nice soft crisp on the exterior which went really well with the softness of the inside. The quality was also great so no complaints there. Their sauce was probably what I didn't like as much. It was flavourful and well prepared but I don't think it paired that well with their scallops. That's just a personal preference though. Their pasta was great, a nice texture, not too soft nor too tough. For the portion they served, the prices were reasonable. The service on the other hand was a bit mediocre. It felt a bit like they did not want to serve us and one of the cups still had something stuck on it on the outside. I am also not a big fan of the paper like tablecloth."
Manoir du spaghetti,5,"I went on a Saturday during the day. The food was absolutely delicious! The portions are big. I couldn't finish my plate. The butter was hidden under the paper. Remember to check under the bread for the butter. You can see what I mean in the photo.
The prices are very reasonable. The service was good and fast. We felt a bit rushed though. We arrived around 3:40 pm and they said that we have until 5:30 pm which is not a problem at all. We usually eat fast so we weren't bothered. However, we felt rushed by the waitress. We left at 5:00 pm. It was enough time for us. No need to be rushed.
We would definitely come back because we loved the food. I highly recommend!"
Manoir du spaghetti,5,"Cosy and traditional ambience. Spicy chicken pasta can be requested to be extremely spicy! There are dried chilli flakes and hot sauce available to add to the spiciness. The service staff is friendly and patient. Parking-wise, there are some handicap lots just right in front of the restaurant. There are quite a number of parking lots along the street."
Manoir du spaghetti,1,"Foot was disgusting cold and the taste was like it had been sitting out for long time the server said everything was done in-house and fresh even the chocolate cake wasn‚Äôt very good.service was slow and poor. Been there before but with this we will never go back.
This is the first time I write a review"
Ma Belle Province Chez √âdem,5,"The sous marine combo was easily enough food for two. Delicious and fresh and hot, great fries, a great lunch."
Ma Belle Province Chez √âdem,5,"Great fast food, super clean dinning room and open kitchen. These owners are doing a fantastic job. Keep up the good work"
Ma Belle Province Chez √âdem,5,Nice
Ma Belle Province Chez √âdem,5,"bruuuuhhh, best bang for the buck"
Ma Belle Province Chez √âdem,5,"The subs are gigantic and delicious!!
Today most restaurants exploit the clientele by squeezing the lemon to the maximum, when the prices only increase and the quantities only decrease it becomes frustrating!
Well here it is not the case!!
The prices are really reasonable and the quantities are very generous!
The service is also excellent and courteous.
Thank you and see you soon!"
La Belle Province,5,"Excelent place, nice personal, good atention and food taste rich."
La Belle Province,5,One of the best old school poutine restaurant. The cheese is very bio and tasty. The potatos are handmade.and the stuff is really really nice and clean. It's not far from the highway and morgan cafe in the Jean 23 boukevard
La Belle Province,1,"My mother in law called with her phone as she was visiting us from Ontario to here and they never answered.

I called again with my phone and they answered. I asked why they did not answer with the phone with the Ontario area code and i was answered that they do not serve english people!

I will NEVER CALL THIS PLACE AGAIN! First the lady who takes order is rude, she tries to do the order so fast that she hung up on me before i was even done making my order. I had to call back! She hung up again on me in the middle of it again. When i tried to call AGAIN! It was an answering machine mentioning a personnal phone of 2 girls. And it never answered after that!

My unfisnished order arrived 1 hour later‚Ä¶We were at 5 mins from there‚Ä¶ The order was missing the drinks i paid for and the ustensils i asked for. I called the delievery guy to get my drinks but i was laughed at and hung up on again. I never received my drinks i paid for!

The pizza was barely having anything in it and let me tell you this‚Ä¶they have no idea what pepperoni is! The cheese on top was bathing in oil and the bacon on top was barely cooked‚Ä¶some big pieces was still Fridge cold! And the pizza was not even cut‚Ä¶or pre-cut‚Ä¶

The menu is OVER PRICED! for the quality they serve‚Ä¶The food was not edible‚Ä¶What a waste of money!

The fries were hard like they were cooked twice‚Ä¶We had a lot but most of them were rock hard‚Ä¶

It was my first time there and i will never call there again and i will never go eat there either due to the quality i was served!

Poor food quality, rude staffs and rude delievery guy!
I would give 0 star but i cant!

You can be sure that i will never try this place ever again! No 2nd chance!"
La Belle Province,1,"If I could give 5 negative stars I would.
They forgot about my order. I am standing right in front of them. They are making orders to the customers who are behind me.
My French is not perfect. It‚Äôs actually my fourth language. I do attempt to speak in French. I asked at least 4 times about my food. I was waiting for my order for half an hour standing in front of them. I needed to sit down , because I didn‚Äôt feel well. I asked to call me when it‚Äôs ready. He just said he doesn‚Äôt speak English. Well, they all understood me perfectly when I cancelled my order.
Meanwhile, I was standing there and watching them handling the food. It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting beyond imagination: with bare hands, not one person in a mask.
I can swear they never clean the tables. I tried to choose a cleaner one when I just came. But they all had bread crumbs and stains. I‚Äôm going to report this place.
Stay away from it!"
La Belle Province,3,The poutine and steamy hot dog were pretty decent. Good diner food. Convenient location with lots of available parking.
Mikes (des Forges),5,Good food at good prices and efficient service.
Mikes (des Forges),5,"Friendly staff, great service and for people like us that don't speak French, our server did his best to speak English. Highly recommend this restaurant and will be back"
Mikes (des Forges),5,I seriously don‚Äôt know their rule that we have to pay at least 10% of our order. Seriously this is not worth she is even not taking care of the customers we have to wait for 20 minutes just to get water
Mikes (des Forges),5,"Great food, really kind service :)"
Mikes (des Forges),1,"Was there 12/28/18 hoping to have breakfast (had amazing eggs benedict and phenomenal service at Mikes in Quebec City previously during the week). Seated at a booth and given lunch menus and then... tumbleweeds....waited...waited...waited and after several minutes of watching the waitresses standing behind the counter talking, we decided to leave. It's very disheartening that this is the same restaurant as the one in Quebec City but with very different service."
Capodimonte Pizza Artisanale,5,"The best pizza I‚Äôve had in my entire life.

After tasting a lot of different pizza places trying to learn and improve my own pizza at home this place definitely takes the crown, fast service, lovely staff and perfect pizza."
Capodimonte Pizza Artisanale,4,"Fast service, good oven wood pizza for the area. The crust is delicious"
Capodimonte Pizza Artisanale,1,I ordered a pizza for delivery but after one hour they called me and said we don‚Äôt have anyone to deliver it for you and you should come yourself to take it out üôÑ when i got the pizza it was burned and cold. The funny part is i paid 18% of tips before i know what services I‚Äôll receive. It‚Äôs a shameüòí
Capodimonte Pizza Artisanale,5,Great customer service! Thank you!
Capodimonte Pizza Artisanale,5,Best pizza we got since we came back 3 years ago from Italy! Simply amazing
Restaurant La Belle Province,3,"15.99 for a small poutine and a small pepsi.
The poutine could feed three people though.
The restaurant looks the same as it did whenever it was created. In need of reno.
They asked me out loud if i wanted to tip and i said no lol, that made it a little awkward. But this is a very expensive poutine. I couldnt afford to tip.
The poutine tastes great but overall im not a big fan of the restaurant."
Restaurant La Belle Province,5,"If you're in the mood for great tasting greasy food (lol) then this is the place to go!!  The poutine is really good and even something as simple as pogos are excellent! They have their ""greasy food genre"" down pat! Staff was also very friendly and polite!"
Restaurant La Belle Province,2,"Ordered poutine and hot dogs. Overcooked fries and old gelatinous gravy in a bland poutine. Hot dogs were ok, saving it from 1 star. The place was very dirty and everything looked like it had not been washed in ages, obviously lacking maintenance and care. Service was ok."
Restaurant La Belle Province,5,I was in Quebec working for a week and my coworkers wanted to take me here to try poutine for the first time. Large portions of food at good prices! Staff was very friendly as well!  I would return again!
Restaurant La Belle Province,5,I love there poutine damn it's huge and it's amazing. It's a very big place very clean. And a lot of parking space. Very friendly staffs. It's also a very clean place. So recommend for ever one who want some nice poutine..
Pizza Salvator√© (Rue Vachon) (4),5,Best pizza I‚Äôve had. Not too cheap. Not too expensive. Just perfect!
Pizza Salvator√© (Rue Vachon) (4),5,We are always happy and excited when we order from Salvatore. It's Hot Fresh and Amazing.
Pizza Salvator√© (Rue Vachon) (4),4,"Servers were really polite. Even when the person was having little knowledge of english, still they listened to my order very patiently since i don‚Äôt know french. Pizza was tasty."
Pizza Salvator√© (Rue Vachon) (4),5,"It was good, it was hot and delivered in a timely manner"
Pizza Salvator√© (Rue Vachon) (4),4,"Ok food for the time. We were there.  Service is top üëå  late night eats. Best place to go beside mc d. Plys they the only one open

Chicken wings are good"
A&W (3650 Boulevard des Forges),4,"A&W has good prices for their food and it is pretty good. Of course their frosted mug root beer is the best around and is a must have. I got a couple burgers and some fries and a root beer and was satisfied with everything I got. It was really quick, really easy, and really good."
A&W (3650 Boulevard des Forges),1,"I went there to order at 9:30 the did not want to let anybody in because they were closing in 30min no just that they were rushing to end their shift and missed my order , very poor customer service ."
A&W (3650 Boulevard des Forges),5,Delicious üòã we enjoyed it. The real taste of good things.+ The lemonades are exceptional. I loved it greatly.
A&W (3650 Boulevard des Forges),1,"Courteous staff, dirty front door, and down too!!! Dirty bathroom, sticky floor wash! More than 50% of the tables not cleaned! Outside paper everywhere and no umbrellas. Too dirty I will not come back! From a retired cook"
A&W (3650 Boulevard des Forges),4,"I like going to this place. Those at the counter are very friendly. Own. There are newspapers, but not enough for my taste. He has about 4 to 5. So have come across the old newspapers from 2 to 3 days before. Eating is good. Well served."
Harvey's (Trois Rivieres),1,"No good! Ordered from mobile app for my family of 7.
2 separate orders placed and both had plenty of mistakes. Wrong toppings on several burgers. We were missing salad dressing and nuggets sauce. We asked for utensils and they weren't in the bag for the salads and worst of all employees seemed frustrated that we had to constantly return to the counter to correct the mistakes to the point that we ended up eating some burgers with the wrong toppings as the employees started laughing at us among them selves. The employees seemed arrogant and anyoide by our presence and even walked away when asked for missing items.All 4 kids meals were also missing plant activities. Very disappointing experience and management should adresse the inappropriate behavior of their employees.  They were more concerned with mopping the floors and having personal conversations about their personal relationships and activities after work then providing service to all walk in customers. We noted that they were also rude to the other customers in line after us.Big fail!"
Harvey's (Trois Rivieres),5,"I love this location and their staff. Even when they mess your order up, they tell you to come back another time to have the same meal made correctly for you free of charge. They are always kind. They are always accommodating. They display great service and integrity in their business. Thank you for being dependable and the best Harvey's in Canada."
Harvey's (Trois Rivieres),5,"Friendly staff, fast service and as far as fast food goes - it's much better than competition. A place to sit outside, clean facilities, great for quick stop."
Harvey's (Trois Rivieres),4,"Heard it was their 60th anniversary and they offered limited-time birthday cake turnovers, and I had a coupon for their new deluxe poutines, so I figured I might as well pay 'em a visit since their fries are usually great (while their burgers not so much so).  When I arrived there, I noticed they had sour candy-flavored slush so I got that along with the spicy chicken poutine and the turnover.

Spicy chicken poutine was your everyday Buffalo chicken poutine; minus green onions, but since this is Harveys you can add yer own toppings so I added some jalapeno peppers and it was quite good, albeit maybe a little mild in terms of spice, compared to other places.  Good thing is, the bowl was surprisingly big, especially compared to other chains whose poutines are usually small.

The sour candy slush was pretty good; not too sour, not too sweet, and refreshing on a hot day.  Only gripe is that the pictures showed it as being blue, which woulda been nice, but it was this sickly shade of green instead; didn't look too appetizing.

Turnover, on the other hand, is what turned this review from a three stars to a four; it was really good.  Unlike McDonalds' generic commercial turnovers that are just squishy and taste of corn syrup, Harveys' turnovers are nice and crispy, coated in crushed candy, and filled with nice, simple baking cream.  Overall a nice wholesome treat.

So if yer more of a fries enthusiast, I'd defo recommend giving Harveys' new poutines a try.  Oh, and get their limited birthday cake turnovers while supplies last, you won't regret it!"
Harvey's (Trois Rivieres),5,"Service is excellent, love the fact that you can choose the toppings of your hamburgers just like at subway. Oh and I love the beef it's so juicy and full of flavour."
La Cage (Trois-Rivi√®res),3,Service was friendly. If chuck e cheese and red robin bar had a baby. Cant get over the burnt popcorn smellü§¢
La Cage (Trois-Rivi√®res),1,"I‚Äôve never experienced such RUDE staff in my life. I didn‚Äôt even think it was possible to talk to customers the way my group and I were spoken to at this location. The most disgusting staff of individuals we have ever had the displeasure of interacting with. Got up and left. Not worth the trouble. La Cage is great, go to another location where they employ people with even an ounce of respect."
La Cage (Trois-Rivi√®res),3,Great service but 4 out of 6 of us didn't finish our plates because of the disappointing taste. Too expensive for what it is. I don't recommend
La Cage (Trois-Rivi√®res),3,"Expensive: 2 burgers, 2 cokes, 16 wings,  1 dessert: $110
Slow service.
Wings were salty, not spicy.
Burgers were not great.
The place is very nice, we were watching a game that ended late and they didn't tell us anything for staying even after the restaurant was closed, that was the best thing. But I wouldn't go back cause the food was just bad."
La Cage (Trois-Rivi√®res),5,Clean friendly fast service. The food is good a wide variety of food to select from
Costco (3000 Boul. Des R√©collets),5,"2nd time there. The food always comes fast and tastes amazing.
Super friendly staff too.
This definitely makes my ""mandatory stops"" now whenever I'm in Qu√©bec"
Costco (3000 Boul. Des R√©collets),5,"Excellent service, great ambience and food at a good price. Definitely consider stopping here if you‚Äôre hungry and on the way from Quebec City and Montreal!"
Costco (3000 Boul. Des R√©collets),5,"In town for work, found online, you will not regret getting the Excalibur... juicy, tasty, flavourful, gone...

Did not take long to enjoy this burger, thick and meaty, fries were nice.

If you can try this out... a gem, for a weary traveler."
Costco (3000 Boul. Des R√©collets),3,Was here in March of 2018. It's been a while but good was good and staff was nice. Nice selection of drinks and wines. Recommended for a lunch.
Costco (3000 Boul. Des R√©collets),5,Staff were fantastic and friendly. The food was wonderfull and very filling
R√¥tisserie Fus√©e (Trois-Rivi√®res Ouest),5,Very good Poutine but ask for brown sauce...
R√¥tisserie Fus√©e (Trois-Rivi√®res Ouest),5,Very good the chicken wrap
R√¥tisserie Fus√©e (Trois-Rivi√®res Ouest),5,Super bon service note 1
R√¥tisserie Fus√©e (Trois-Rivi√®res Ouest),3,Face good excellent
R√¥tisserie Fus√©e (Trois-Rivi√®res Ouest),5,Top pouley
Scores (Blvd des Forges),5,Great food. Great salad bar for my kid with dietary requirements. Best allergen sheet and nutritional information I've seen so far. All available on their website. We will definitely be back.
Scores (Blvd des Forges),5,It's chicken so nothing fancy but it's good comfort food.
Scores (Blvd des Forges),4,They didn't have any choice in the kid's menu.
Scores (Blvd des Forges),4,This has to be the best Scores I‚Äôve been to! The salad bar was very fresh and well presented. The lettuce was super fresh.  I took the chicken breast which was crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside. I always stop in Trois Rivi√®res to eat there.   Excellent service too!
Scores (Blvd des Forges),1,Forget about the salad bar or the soup of the day. Now they give you a sour coleslaw salad served on a tiny plate. Smaller portions at the same price. This used to be my favorite place to go with the family. Not anymore.
PFK (14 rue Fusey),2,"Well we do not go to KFC that often, however in comparn with other fast food chains here in Canada, this was the worst experience so far‚Ä¶"
PFK (14 rue Fusey),1,This place is dirt as hell.  I am not sure how would a dead body smell like but its certainly not worst than here. . I am honest. It's really disgusting.
PFK (14 rue Fusey),4,Hot and fresh fried chicken served with reasonable price. Dinning area is clean. Need to wait for 20 mins in peak hour.
PFK (14 rue Fusey),5,"Food is as expected. The staff could benefit from more training. Check to make sure all your items are in the bag. That said, who I assume is the manager is quick to act if something is wrong. So A+ on that side."
PFK (14 rue Fusey),5,really friendly wich is a very good thing
"Subway (128, boul. Sainte-Madeleine)",5,excellent
"Subway (128, boul. Sainte-Madeleine)",5,Great! New favorite place to eat close to home.
"Subway (128, boul. Sainte-Madeleine)",3,The staff speak only French so was hard to order‚Äã in English
"Subway (128, boul. Sainte-Madeleine)",5,Always yummy and great service
"Subway (128, boul. Sainte-Madeleine)",5,Good service üëç
Pacini (Trois-Rivi√®res),5,Had a wonderful date with my partner here.   Amazing atmosphere and they nailed the non-alcoholic drink I got.
Pacini (Trois-Rivi√®res),5,"Nice place!
good food, but small portion :D"
Pacini (Trois-Rivi√®res),4,Our first meal in Trois-Rivi√®res and it was fantastique! We love everything about it. We had the duoetto option where we combined half a pizza with another dish - linguine alfredo and salad. Just the perfect amount of food. And absolutely delicious!
Pacini (Trois-Rivi√®res),4,Good food and good service...I recommand the cocktail it is so delicious
Pacini (Trois-Rivi√®res),4,Service is excellent. Atmosphere is great. Food is very good but not impressed by the risotto.  I want the italian flavour.
ITACHO SUSHI √Ä VOLONT√â,3,"The place is busy, but the service is quick. This is why it surprised me that a lot of the cooked food came out cold. The rice was inconsistent and sometimes overcooked and mushy. Often fell apart when I tried to eat with chopsticks. Overall, the flavor and presentation were there, and I enjoyed spending time with my friends, but I probably won't be coming back. Almost $100 for 2 people, and I don't feel it was really worth it."
ITACHO SUSHI √Ä VOLONT√â,4,"Food choices and the service was great, atmosphere kinda sucked..maybe a little update of furniture and paint and they will be the perfect place to have sushi.
Price was good for ayce sushi."
ITACHO SUSHI √Ä VOLONT√â,4,"Seen better for cheaper food wise, but it's a nice place to go for sure, don't forget to pat the cat waiter robot!"
ITACHO SUSHI √Ä VOLONT√â,5,I'm a vegetarian and I had plenty of options to choose from. They even customized some rolls toy choice. Enjoyed the food. Very friendly staff. this place was so packed. Glad we made a reso.
ITACHO SUSHI √Ä VOLONT√â,5,Great variety of food for the price. Good value. I am torn though because I would like to see more robots but of course not at the expense of staff. But seriously though the robot is super cool.
Benny&Co. (Trois-Rivi√®res),5,Fast and excellent service with Josee who served me at the table thank you very much delicious sauce and cabbage salad at will and also excellent driving service yesterday fast and the staff are very nice and smiling again thank you very good meal!!!
Benny&Co. (Trois-Rivi√®res),5,"Best chicken ever eaten! The portions are more than generous and with the flick of a fork, you are left with only the bones. It's impressive. The service is second to none. Thanks to Marie who convinced us to try with incomparable assurance, not to mention the smile in her voice. Fast and very friendly delivery. Thank you and congratulations to the team"
Benny&Co. (Trois-Rivi√®res),5,"What a superb service
We came to eat on site on Saturday May 27 at 5:00 p.m.
The service was well beyond our expectations. Congratulations to the whole team there. Food quality level A+
Hot, quick and succulent food."
Benny&Co. (Trois-Rivi√®res),3,My favorite grill! By cons a little disappointed that the person who took my order did not tell me that the sauce was not at will when it comes out and charged an extra. I still recommend it anyway because it's very good!
Benny&Co. (Trois-Rivi√®res),5,"New restaurant, new bistro-style decor, lots of staff on site, very warm welcome, fast and courteous table service. Very good chicken as always."
Fromagerie Victoria (Trois-Rivi√®res),4,"The poutine of the momemt, was a shish taouk inspired poutine. The topings choice (combination of flavor) was ok, but the cheese was delicious as away.

The ice of the moment was pistachio. It was delicious it would order ot again.

This place is a good choice for new famille, there is a lot of place to eat, baby chairs, AC."
Fromagerie Victoria (Trois-Rivi√®res),4,"Fromagerie Victoria has very good cheese. They have a variety of food items all sounding really good. I got the chicken poutine and was very impressed with it. It was fairly quick to get my food, a little expensive but very good. Very fun place, they had a sideshow of them making the cheese which was fun to watch while waiting. Would definitely recommend the poutine here."
Fromagerie Victoria (Trois-Rivi√®res),3,"Mediocre. Felt that $12 for a half club sandwich is kind of expensive. Also their Mac n cheese is dry, lots of cheese though, so depending on how you prefer it. Also expected more cheese selections to purchase to take home, since they are a ‚Äúfromagerie‚Äù."
Fromagerie Victoria (Trois-Rivi√®res),5,"Amazing place, amazing poutine, amazing cheese and thanks to the pretty girl who made sure I always had a full hot cup of coffee :)"
Fromagerie Victoria (Trois-Rivi√®res),4,"Super good and they give you a lot
fresh cheese on the poutines"
Restaurant Rico,5,I have been ordering and coming to this establishment often for the last 2 years. As a Latin American I get to enjoy so food I can‚Äôt easily find around.
Restaurant Rico,4,"Had coupons, so I figured I'd try this place, not knowing it was a Mexican/South American store/restaurant combo.

The restaurant part has an original menu, but is kind of average on the flavor and price department.

The store part though, has an amazing diversity of products you couldn't find anywhere else in town.  From authentic Mexican hot cocoa to non-candy guava paste cubes, it just has it all!"
Restaurant Rico,4,Good service.. good selection of Latin products.. food is hard to say.. you have to have an open view of what the food in south America is.. but is ok
Restaurant Rico,5,Best fire roasted chicken in Trois Rivi√®res for the price.
Restaurant Rico,4,Nice food. They offer mostly Colombian food.
Restaurant Soleil d‚ÄôAsie,4,"Totally unpredictable experience,  the food is unbelievable, but the waitress seems to be more interested in her phone then servicing tables."
Restaurant Soleil d‚ÄôAsie,4,Very good!
Restaurant Soleil d‚ÄôAsie,5,"The food was simply delicious, o But what really caught my attention were the generous portions which left me full and fully satisfied. I had trouble finishing my plate!"
Restaurant Soleil d‚ÄôAsie,5,"Superb discovery! I ordered the Thai beef, very tasty, just enough filling, loved it! I highly recommend. Nice atmosphere at the relaxed restaurant and beautiful decor, lots of parking. Thank you üôèüèΩüíûüôèüèΩ"
Restaurant Soleil d‚ÄôAsie,1,Really disappointing experience! As much for the two menus that we took. General Tao really good. Even the rice was not great. How to miss rice? The sauce on the other dish simply tasted like soy sauce. It was the first and last time I went there.
Kuto Comptoir √† Tartare (Trois-Rivi√®res),1,"Pire poke bowl, pire tartare‚Ä¶
EVER"
Kuto Comptoir √† Tartare (Trois-Rivi√®res),4,"Excellent tartar, good prices. Fast service."
Kuto Comptoir √† Tartare (Trois-Rivi√®res),5,Loved it!!! Excellent food and service!!!
Kuto Comptoir √† Tartare (Trois-Rivi√®res),5,Very good dinner for my birthday. The waitress service a1
Kuto Comptoir √† Tartare (Trois-Rivi√®res),2,"Unfortunately, have passed the ""kuto"" in quality! It's been 2 times that I'm disappointed ... new menu? ? Hmm, yes!! In fact, it's that the ingredients like in the pokes (fish that I like to catch) are less on the big check mark. Before: rice on the bottom with a little coulis that tasted of maple syrup. Today: rice with a little coulis that tastes like soy sauce. Before: a lot of texture in my poke, a little crispy, a little seaweed salad there. Now: it's salad, grape tomatoes and not too much fla fla. Not to mention the tartare on top which was very respectable. The last 2 experiences, full of sauce, bad texture. Bottom line, it's expensive, it cuts everywhere! Disappointing, it was so good!!!"
Thaizone (Barkoff),2,Ordered takeout and its alright. First time I have ever had pad thai with this much soy sauce in the mix. Didnt taste like peanut sauce at all. Also ordered chicken and it came with both tofu and chicken (not sure if thats how its supposed to be). Orange chicken came with not a lot of chicken but was very good.
Thaizone (Barkoff),2,"Food was alright, portions are a lot smaller than they use to be so paying 17$ for 4-5 pieces of chicken is a bit much. Bathrooms were absolutely disgusting, you can tell they do not clean them often, they reeked or urine and were unclean. We wanted to mention it to the staff but no one was at the front. Won't be returning to this location."
Thaizone (Barkoff),2,"Ordered 12 lunches, no spice levels or extra spice nor utensils. Too much sugar, will order elsewhere;("
Thaizone (Barkoff),1,The food here was terrible.  Ordered general Tao a l'orang√© and it was super sweet and soggy.   The kids working there are trying their best but have no supervision or resource so the food is not good.
Thaizone (Barkoff),1,"First off, the order was really long and cold when it arrived. Turned out it wasn't the right order. They came and dropped off our actual order and recovered the wrong one. The Pad Thai this time was hot. However there were only 3 shrimp in it and way too much soy plus a random chunk of apple for some reason. Feels like they made a mistake and just gave us scraps even though it cost us $45 for supper. So needless to say $45 down the drain and I'm still hungry."
Restaurant √âph√®se,5,"A great restaurant. Best Turkish food I've has in ages. Everything made in house, including the excellent baklava. Normally I'm not a huge fan of donair, but this was exceptional. Great service too."
Restaurant √âph√®se,5,"Friendly staff and proprietor, opened about 1 year ago (as of July 2022), traditional preparations, great burgers and meat at very reasonable prices! 5 stars üòä"
Restaurant √âph√®se,5,"Wonderful food with good service, everyone here is nice and helpful, the sandwich and coft√© wrap is amazing! Would definitely visit again next time when I'm in Trois-Rivi√®res :)"
Restaurant √âph√®se,5,"The best Turkish food that I tried in Canada.
Very friendly staff. Looking forward to open their branch in Montr√©al."
Restaurant √âph√®se,5,The people were very accommodating to me and my lack of French! They suggested a very good meal which I enjoyed greatly.
Pita Pit (Boulevard des Forges),5,"Best pita place around. It's 1h30 drive away from where i live but anytime i drive by Trois-Rivi√®res i stop for a Pita.

Hopelly one day there'll be one around Qu√©bec"
Pita Pit (Boulevard des Forges),1,Service was long. They did a error wrong meat in my pita...not really happy of my experience. I am assuming it's not always like that...
Pita Pit (Boulevard des Forges),5,very good fresh and very friendly staff
Pita Pit (Boulevard des Forges),5,"Always fresh and delicious, merci Michel!"
Pita Pit (Boulevard des Forges),5,Awesome food you can personalize.
Le Pot Papilles et Cocktails,5,"Nice atmosphere, very hip. Lots of drink selections and good menu.

If you love Tartare - this is the place to go. If you love good food, this is a good place, the tacos were perfectly done.

It was an unintended stop; but I'm glad we did. Food and service was 100%

Please note: they don't do fries. You get GOOD garden salad as a side, which is a welcome change."
Le Pot Papilles et Cocktails,1,"Worst customer service ever.
Came in to order 2 soups to go. The waiter seemed displeased already that I spoke only English to her. Tried to ask her additional questions and she clearly ignored me and continued to do what she was doing. She was not trying to be helpful at all. Then I saw that there were around 10 restaurant workers all around me that did not try to help me either. I totally felt like I was bothering them and disturbing whatever it is that they were doing. I approached the waitress again and she pointed to her coworker at the bar. I approached him and after a few attempts managed to order my two soups to go. While I was waiting for them, restaurant workers weirdly were looking at me instead of trying to accommodate me or make me feel welcomed. I finally got my two soups but they didn‚Äôt include the spoon. I approached the waitress who was clearly annoyed at that point by me and she showed it.
I got out of the restaurant and was grateful to be out. Wow! What a horrible feeling.

I was also disappointed that my soup cups were half full - see my photo. I mean - whatta!!? Either use smaller soup cups or give a normal portion.

In any case - if you speak English don‚Äôt come to this place. It‚Äôs a shame - because the place has a nice vibe and interior and waiters make you feel unwelcome."
Le Pot Papilles et Cocktails,4,"Stopped by this restaurant on our road trip and quite pleased with our dinner. The service was slow as it was great weather and the terrace was full. The presentation of the plates was amazing, and poke bowls were very fresh (could use a bit less vinegar though‚Ä¶the salmon poke bowl is a bit too sour for my taste). The nachos were amazing! (It‚Äôs a shame that they don‚Äôt have kids menu.) Overall, still a great experience."
Le Pot Papilles et Cocktails,5,"Superbe repas, cocktails d√©licieux! This restaurant was an amazing find during our trip. There was a special three course meal going on featuring local cheeses and that maple dessert felt like it was designed for me! Highly recommend to anyone."
Le Pot Papilles et Cocktails,5,"Went for lunch with wifey on a Friday. I had the p√¢t√© chinois tartare, oysters, and some wine. Wifey had a duck grill cheese. We both really enjoyed our food. Service was nice and polite. Server could speak some English. NZ sav blanc was nice. We would definitely go back again."
Caf√© Frida,5,"Delightful and delicious!  We really enjoyed the breakfast sandwich, shakshuka, and coffee.  We sat outside overlooking the river.
Everything is vegan and very flavorful.  As a regular carnivore I enjoyed the breakfast sandwich tremendously even though it was made entirely of vegetables.
I plan to return for more!"
Caf√© Frida,5,This is the best vegan restaurant in town. I could order anything without fear of ingredient from animal origin. I had falafel and matcha latte iced. Food is too good to be missed. Loved this place. God bless vegans.
Caf√© Frida,4,"BRUNCH REVIEW - The chicken waffle was quite difficult to eat as the waffles were very dense that I couldn't finish the dish. The vegan chicken was tastety though.
Their vegan sausage was really delicious but the vegan omelette was very bland but it was a place worth trying. You get the view of St. Lawrence River in a cheerful atmosphere. There was a long delay to receive our food which I think that they might be understaffed. A good one time visit if you are in the city."
Caf√© Frida,5,"Excellent vegan breakfast. Does not try to copy non-vegan dishes. I would recommend to vegans/vegetarians but not so much meat eaters. For example, the eggs Benedict was made with tempeh,mushroom, spinach and a cashew base sauce. If someone thinks they are getting a regular Benedict and get this they probably will not enjoy it. I personally adore this food as I am a vegan for 5 years now. beautiful view, adorable ambiance, great art on the walls, amiable staff."
Caf√© Frida,4,"Firstly, the food is incredible! Some of the best vegan food I'd ever had (and I'm not vegan). Lost a star because they forgot our order, and after waiting for 45 minutes we had to follow up with the wait staff."
Thai Express (Cap-de-la-Madeleine),1,"They never give the right drink through deliveries. Out of 3 times I ordered either a pepsi or a Mtn. Dew I got sent a diet pepsi. If you don't have the drink, don't charge it and don't send it, people will understand more than being charged for something they didn't want. Food is usually bland. We order for mild spicy stuff and it doesn't even taste seasoned.

Edit: Last time I tried to order a similar order with a pepsi, I never got notified they didn't have it. I called in store and the person in charge was rude. I explained her how to notify the customer via the uber app. and she didn't seem interested. I told her that when you receive a notification, your order becomes on hold and she immediately if I wanted an in-store credit or an online one. I asked for an online one and asked for directions and she hung up on me saying ""Ok merci bonne soir√©e"" without giving me explanations."
Thai Express (Cap-de-la-Madeleine),3,"Usually love this place and fully satisfied. Great size meals. Also has drive through. However, today I was unsatisfied my ravioli was burnt and meals had no sauce, no spices it was really dry and tasteless. Kinda sad."
Thai Express (Cap-de-la-Madeleine),1,"I ordered one of my usuals: peanut butter stir fry with chicken with no carrots, iceberg salad, mint and coriander. I also opted for extra chicken and extra peanut sauce.

When I arrived home, I noticed that they put iceberg salad and there was no extra chicken or sauce. Due to the distance, I was unable to return to the restaurant so I called them. The employee that I spoke to informed me that it was not iceberg salad but nappa and I should contact the store manager the next day, to see if he can give me a rebate on my next order since, there was no extra chicken or sauce.

I contacted the manager who was extremely rude and unprofessional towards me. He yelled at me and informed me that they always put nappa and his cooked confirmed that he put extra chicken and sauce and he hung up on me.

I have ordered this several times in the past and not once was nappa put in my stir fry. Furthermore, I did not receive the ingredients for which I had to pay extra.

In light of the horrible experience I had with the manager, his lack of professionalism, cooperation and customer service and because I did not receive what I ordered, I will never return to that Thai Express and do not recommend it to anyone."
Thai Express (Cap-de-la-Madeleine),2,"The general tao was good but they refused to change the veggies for fried rice. They made it how they see it on the board. Other than that it is a good place.

Update: the food was good a month ago. But i have been going the last 3 weeks and the food is downgrading...the rice the last 2 weeks is over cooked (took a dough texture), the shrimps...not cooked enough...and found a little bone in the ""Boneless chicken..."" And why do you leave the tail on the shrimps for?!
I asked for extra sauce and did not get it...

I am not going back...
The best thai express is the thai express at the round about of yamachiche guys!"
Thai Express (Cap-de-la-Madeleine),5,The new ice cream was good. The coconut water was refreshing. The servers were nice. I'd come back anytime!
D√©lices de Babi,5,HUGE portions. Incredibly delicious. Very nice
D√©lices de Babi,4,Cute place. Very hearty meals. It would be helpful if the menu had the typical one line description of each dish and the main ingredients.
D√©lices de Babi,5,"We stopped here on a whim on our way from Montreal to Quebec City. The food was delicious, fresh and cooked on the spot. I never had food from the Ivory Coast before but everything was really good!"
D√©lices de Babi,5,"Friendly employees and prompt service. The dishes are generous and delicious. Nice atmosphere too, different from the city center üòâ"
D√©lices de Babi,5,"Very warm and the meal is very good and well served thank you, I recommend this place"
Restaurant Soleil d‚ÄôAsie (Trois-Rivi√®re),5,"The store close at 2 pm and reopen after 4pm on Monday.
I loved the chicken and rice soup, it was the best so far.
I ordered seafood hot plate and it was good. I will certainly visit this place another time."
Restaurant Soleil d‚ÄôAsie (Trois-Rivi√®re),4,"Went there for the first time today, and it's certainly not gonna be my last.  Was served by an actual Vietnamese with a contagious laugh who obviously loved his job, and the food was absolutely delicious; easily the best Vietnamese in Trois-Rivieres by FAR.

The review only loses a star because the food was a bit on the fatty side; it's the best Vietnamese in town, but not the healthiest :P"
Restaurant Soleil d‚ÄôAsie (Trois-Rivi√®re),5,Awesome service! Owners are there all the time and want you to have a great time. Food was fresh and very tasty
Restaurant Soleil d‚ÄôAsie (Trois-Rivi√®re),4,Very nice bowl of pho. Reasonable price. The owner was really nice.
Restaurant Soleil d‚ÄôAsie (Trois-Rivi√®re),5,"Very good vietnamese resto in downtown three rivers. Check out their Pho, general tao, and pad thai."
Sushiman (Centre les Rivi√®res),1,Sushi cut super thin compared to other sushiman locations. For 20$ with tax and tip this is quite pathetic.
Sushiman (Centre les Rivi√®res),1,I regularly order on uber or doordash. It's been 3 times in a short time that I order to then see a notification that my order has been canceled because the trade does not take the order. I know how it works so I know it's the employee who refuses to place the order since I generally order in the middle of the afternoon when the business is open.....
Sushiman (Centre les Rivi√®res),1,"Hard lawyers, the rolls did not hold, impossible to take without them opening. Soft tempura. Extremely mushy rice. Order obviously made in a hurry by one or amateurs. Too bad my dudes."
Sushiman (Centre les Rivi√®res),2,The rice was transparent and dry so not fresh at all! $20 for a really inedible plate is very disappointing.
Sushiman (Centre les Rivi√®res),1,I've never eaten his sushi so disgusting it's been 3 times and it's always so disgusting! Made by amateurs to feed animals! ashamed !
La Cantine,1,"Ordered chicken tenders and pouting. Tenders were tiny, poutin was subpar. Will not order from here again. Waste of 28$, I now have to go to Tim Hortons across the street"
La Cantine,1,Every time I order at this restaurant there is an error or an item is burned... I paid for 2 poutine.. received 2 fries. It's been 20 minutes that I call in a loop at the restaurant and no one answers .. last order my club sandwich tasted so burned that even my dog ‚Äã‚Äãdid not want it. I eat at the restaurant almost every day so I leave several chances to the restaurant in the region since there are not tons of them but this is really the last time. I never thought I'd say that in my life but I sure would have had a better meal at the convenience store delivered. Do not order from this restaurant!!!!!!!!!!
La Cantine,1,"I ordered 6 kogos with a plate of 3 chicken fillets with fries and coleslaw.
The kogos arrived half cooked, the breadcrumbs in the center were still runny-sticky. THEN, I received a mini chicken breast with jasmine rice and garden salad."
La Cantine,1,"Very disappointed order 10.minute ago I received my. As a fried hamburger is missing, the meatball thus charred it. Half filled poutine bread very disappointed attacks call. THE. Restaurant no response..."
La Cantine,1,"NEVER ORDER THERE!!!!! We ordered several months ago and it was excellent, the caesar salad and the club was delicious!! We ordered today and it's disgusting! Nothing to do with the meals we had already ordered!!!! It makes no sense to pay for it!!!!!"
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Trois Rivieres),5,The menu is easy to understand and the ingredients are fresh and tasty! Definitely try the pork adobo and the drunk chicken üòÅüòã
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Trois Rivieres),3,Good food but the serving sizes are SMALL compared to other Quesadas I've been too.
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Trois Rivieres),5,"Good service,  and the food taste good, is a good place to dine in"
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Trois Rivieres),4,service Doordash svp
Quesada Burritos and Tacos (Trois Rivieres),5,The young man who served me was nice and gave me great service! I come from Mexico and in this restaurant I really felt like I was still there. Really great! I highly recommend!
Les Moulins La Fayette,5,"Delicious food! Decadent desserts and amazing service! The coffee is exceptionally great!
The staff was very informative and courteous! Will definitely be back for more!!!"
Les Moulins La Fayette,5,"A lovely caf√© with sandwiches, salads, soup and yummy dessert"
Les Moulins La Fayette,1,"Preferential service to French speaking customers. AVOID if you do not speak French... or, prior to entering this place, grab a Tylenol from Jean Coutu (in the same plaza)."
Les Moulins La Fayette,1,I am sure the cakes and the baguettes were  delicious... couple days ago before I bought them.
Les Moulins La Fayette,5,Delicious as always
Tiki-Ming (Centre commercial Les Rivi√®res),4,Food taste not bad. Good choice in the food court if you want some different choices from burger and sandwich.
Tiki-Ming (Centre commercial Les Rivi√®res),1,do not buy here very small portion
Tiki-Ming (Centre commercial Les Rivi√®res),2,I ordered by the UberEats app and they screwup my order! The food was not even ok. It didn‚Äôt taste anything except oil and fat
Tiki-Ming (Centre commercial Les Rivi√®res),5,Freshly made in front of you.
Tiki-Ming (Centre commercial Les Rivi√®res),5,the best
Le Poke Station (Trois-Rivi√®res),5,Great Restaurant
Le Poke Station (Trois-Rivi√®res),5,Restaurant
Le Poke Station (Trois-Rivi√®res),5,"Un bon endroit en ville si vous avez le go√ªt d'un Pok√© Bowl, prix raisonnable pour le poid du bol. Seul b√©mol de mon c√¥t√©, j'ai trouv√© les deux bol (aloha et honolulu) un peut s√®che, seulement quelque goute de sauce dans le honolulu et je n'en n'ai pas trouv√© dans l'aloha. La portion de saumon semblait plus petite que celle de thon."
Le Poke Station (Trois-Rivi√®res),5,"Very good tuna poke bowl (Honolulu). Very nice staff, punctual order. Good value for money. Thanks again I will be back üôèüèΩü•∞üíõüëçüèΩ"
Le Poke Station (Trois-Rivi√®res),5,"The service is exceptional. The portions are perfect and the food is very tasty and fresh. Having experienced it both in person and through DoorDash, it's delicious. I definitely recommend it, there are flavors for everyone."
Madame Woo,2,"The first thing that came into my mind when I opened the menu was that the food here is quite expensive. Most dishes are around 25$ which is somewhat crazy to me. Even a pokeball that you can usually find for around 10-15$, the most basic one here was around 23$. Just seeing the prices made me regret a bit going inside the restaurant. But, I have to admit that I do like the interior decorations. It makes it very cozy. Plus, the portions are pretty big so it does make up a bit for the price but I would have preferred it if the portions were smaller and the prices were lower. The food itself was of decent quality. The tuna that I had was great but I wasn't a big fan of the vinegary sauce they mixed in. Jasmin rice was also an interesting combination for this type of food, but I think I still prefer short grain rice instead, especially for pokebowls. Beside that, they had a lot of different toppings which made it a lot more enjoyable but some of them, like the carrots, were not a pleasant addition at least to me. The pad thai was also way too sweet, it was definitely not the best I had."
Madame Woo,1,The food was bad and expensive. I ordered a pad Thai which was extremely sweet. I had to send it back and asked for a Thai curry. The waitress then brought me another pad Thai. I sent that back too and finally got the curry which was edible but had a bit of a weird taste.
Madame Woo,4,Atmosphere and food felt very Asian despite the lack of any real Asian influence in the kitchen. Good place. To recommend. Great service. Place to go when hungry.
Madame Woo,1,"Sadly this could have been a great asian food experience but the food was super low quality and the service was ok at most. Not sure if they even know how to cook the actual recipes(?).

Drink was served in super cute Lucky Cat jar but was super watered down. Tasted like leftover cold green tea ‚Äî definitely less than a cap‚Äôs worth of alcohol ‚Äî no mango taste whatsoever.

The appetizers were VERY meh. Thai soup was more like a potage with little to no taste and edamame were so oily it was hard to pop them open. Drowned the soup in sriracha.

The main dish was even worse ‚Äî General Tao from the gutters. I switched rice for udon noodles and they was WAY too much and undercooked, the sauce was tasteless barely any tangy or sweetness and was legit not thickened at all ‚Äî just a gross soup. To top it off: one huge piece of frozen broccoli and three chicken pieces that tasted like flash fried frozen nuggets with 0 crispness ‚Äî just mushy and gross.

The only upside is they agreed to give me my drink for free after this terrible meal and still I will not be going back.

Sorry Madam Woo but clearly your authenticity is non-existant and you are an overpriced and false advertising low-tier asian place. The mall‚Äôs Thai Express beats you hands down."
Madame Woo,3,"Cute asian-inspired decor and fusion cuisine near Trois-Rivi√®res' Harbourfront Park. There aren't many vegan options. I asked for this spicy Thai tofu poke bowl which came with many fresh, colorful ingredients. It was delicious but there was a bit too much sauce. The price is midrange. Service is friendly but a bit slow."
Mezcal Taqueria,5,"Nice welcoming hostess with a big smile, kind bartender without any extravagant moves, fast service and nice ambient, tasty nachos on generous size, no discrimination to English speakers, respectful employees that don't rush you to choose your food&beverage. The venue is small, and you may feel a bit crowded, but it's all good üëç üòâ"
Mezcal Taqueria,5,"Excellent food! Fresh, tasty, diverse!"
Mezcal Taqueria,5,"This place was amazing! I really was mindblown by everything! The staff was friendly, the ambiance was good and the food was amazing!

With my friends we shared the guacamole & totopos which was delicious. The totopos (corn chips) were home made and incredible!

Then I had the shrimp tacos that were sooo good, I was happy I decided to had an extra one to my plate!

We finished with Churros which were also delicious!

All of the food on the menu looked appetizing and I wish I could have tried all of the tacos!

The only thing I wish they would have been done differently is the possibility to mix tacos filling. There was no way to try multiple filling unless you ordered different plates.

But it's not that big of a deal since I know I will comeback to try some more dishes."
Mezcal Taqueria,4,"Preface, professionally trained chef, I got there without a reservation which I know I should have done but I threw caution to the wind, whatever they had a spot (hurray for solo traveling), menu is small, but tight, I went for camaron taco (shrimps) and excellent, I was very pleased, my only gripe is that it is a party place so crowded and loud, but would recommend"
Mezcal Taqueria,5,"I stopped by this resto on my way from QC back to Mtl.
I have never tasted something so delicious in my life. This is the best tasting mexican restaurant I have ever been to. The presentation of the food is gorgeous, the food itself tastes amazing, I fell absolutely in love with their nachos and I would definitely be willing to drive from Montreal to Mezcal just for the food.
I absolutely recommend this Taqueria, it was an amazing experience."
Hippo Tea,5,They are really nice. The cashier couldn't understand you much in English but she really nice and heart warming. Not the best milk tea but i love their attitude
Hippo Tea,3,"These are not the authentic bubble teas. Tapioca pearls are soft. The staff is not flexible at all, they make funny faces at every customer request. I do not recommend! To try other shops nearby."
Hippo Tea,1,I ordered 2 teas from this place on uber eat. I was billed and never received the order.
Hippo Tea,5,Too good and super nice people :)
