heres the thing they miss items in orders rather often often as in 95 of the orders ive made here have had missing items or been just completely wrong
of course the reason for this issue could be any number of things it could be point of sale or just lack of coordination or anything else all i know is that this has not improved with time

i just want my darn large chocolate frosty its on the receipt theres a spoon in the bag but no frosty to be found
i dont know what i should expect continually ordering here but i just want the friggin frosty i ordered i mean seriously thats the item wendys is known for its printed down on the receipt its the only cold thing its in a cup as opposed to metallic wrapping the food has there are infinite opportunities to notice hey theres something missing here

the only reason this isnt a 15 is because their food is good

price  

music is really calm

maya and adam are really nice and friendly gives you really good recommendation

chai latte 1010  froth not airy dense has quite a flavor unlike others which is just air it has light and natural flavor which is really nice

mocha  810 its really good you have to mix the froth to have much better taste dont be shy asking for teaspoon

fried oyster mushroom 1010  smells like fried chicken the taste is really good

breaded cauliflower bites  910
 there is a bit of spicy kick cauliflower is nicely cooked taste better with the dipping sauce sweet and spicy

spicy  savoury eggplant 810  much spicer than dipping sauce of cauliflower bites there is a lot of bell pepper tho be careful there is one chili underneath otherwise you will be surprised why it got spicy so fast its quite good to partner with cauliflower bites or fried tofu

nasi goreng 910  has nice flavor to it not overpowering if youll eat it with the entree you could also eat it on its own which is great

we also had the very dense chocobrownie it looks appetizing but you definitely need water during and after eating it that aside the overall flavor profile was nice

the spicy coconut sauce and the chicken were the  in each dish for me im not a vegetarian nor vegan but ive grown up eating it the majority of my adult life and those aspects were a hit for my palate

the food was prepared nicely it took about 20 minutes maximum to be served

note the same chef prepares both dinein and take out orders it is not a large kitchen so patience should be exercised

the bathroom my mom says was spacious and clean

the dinein seating was comfortable

it was empty when we arrived but did not feel uncomfortable

service left much to be desired the initial server was attentive and hospitable but she left soon after we received our food and was seemingly replaced by 2 persons 1 who was tending to the register and assisting with take out order preparation and 2 a person who was glued to the phone and laptop

we practically cleared our own dishes had to keep going up front for assistance when we had questions",0.9783,Good

aside from the service issue we started with the pigs feet which was delicious personally this is not a dish i enjoy due to the many bones but it was very authentic to the real stuff in china and the sichuan pepper flavour was spot on definitely a great choice if looking for the real deal

for the noodles i had the tomato crossing the bridge which was delicious its not spicy at all but the flavour of the booth is amazing all of the crossing the bridge noodles come with a side tray of vegetables and if you get the beef slices or other meats they come on the tray like in a hot pot i get the meatballs though instead which are really nice and they come directly in the soup the other soup we had was the fish one which again the soup was amazing

the noodles are technically all you can eat but the bowls are so large you dont really need a second bowl of noodles and they dont actually taste like anything for us its all about the broths their bubble teas are also very good but take quite a while to be made so overall its worth it just dont go if in a rush",0.9935,Good

i love dagu rice noodle they have a lot of great soup dishes and sides if you go there you know youll be full when you leave

when they had the offer for a vip card i knew i had to get it and it was a good call for sure

their prices are very good for what you get and on mondays they have 1 skewers which is pretty awesome

i look forward to the day when tastebuds will adopt more environmentally sustainable methods of serving its patrons ie by way of using recyclable containers i chagrin every time i carry out styrofoam andor plastic containers out of tastebuds hopefully with time this will change and tastebuds will become the best takeout restaurant that not only looks after its patrons but also the environment",0.9941,Good

first and foremost the waiting time at this establishment continues to be excessively long despite the queue not being particularly extensive on this occasion i was made to wait for nearly 10 minutes mirroring previous experiences it is disheartening to see that despite having more than seven staff members working at the front the efficiency of service remains subpar

one of the main issues i encountered was the apparent lack of understanding displayed by the employee taking orders it was evident that she struggled to comprehend the items being ordered leading me to assume that she was new in her position however when i inquired about her experience she confirmed that she was not new which further solidified my concerns regarding the dedication of the staff clear communication and knowledge of the menu are fundamental aspects of providing satisfactory customer service and it was disconcerting to witness this lacking amongst the team

moreover the overall demeanor of the staff members was far from welcoming none of them had a cheerful or friendly disposition which is an essential characteristic in the field of customer service a warm and positive atmosphere plays a crucial role in ensuring a pleasant customer experience and unfortunately this was absent during my visit

it is with a heavy heart that i feel compelled to write this review as i genuinely hope that it will serve as constructive feedback for the management team of this tim horton store i believe there is a pressing need for action to address these recurring issues and develop effective solutions to improve the level of customer service at this establishment

in conclusion i kindly request that the management team thoroughly evaluates the performance of the employees focusing on their dedication training and understanding of customer needs additionally consider implementing measures to foster a positive and welcoming environment for customers as it can significantly enhance their overall experience

i trust that the management team will take the necessary steps to rectify these concerns promptly tim hortons has a reputation for excellence and it is my sincere hope that the management will restore the high standards that have come to be expected from the brand",0.9914,Good

and when he came on the phone i was not treated fairly he was interrupting me when i was trying to tell him what happened and how i would like it resolved then he proceeded to tell me to calm down when i truly was being calm and just trying to communicate to him what happened and how i would like it resolved he actually began to laugh sarcastically at one point and now i was feeling angry but i still did not raise my voice nor did i become abusive the manger did agree to send me a store credit of 20 which i will give to someone else because i will never do business with this franchise again

the floors in the restaurant look like they havent seen a broom in years fruit flies throughout the dining room half the tables uncleaned seat cushions ripped or cut out on most of the booths

the soda machine has about 5 percent of the drinks available the rest arent available

we ordered the sushi and walked over to pick it up we were incredibly disappointed with some of the worst sushi weve ever had it was almost sweet and noticeably worse than the sushi even at fortinos

not only was the food not the best but the service is awful the hours are completely random and they often have the sign showing open displayed but the door is locked user many passersby pull the door only to realize theres no food

whats worst even still is that this business took the business account of the previous business so as to maintain the good ratings and good will from the previous business which was something completely different they havent even taken down the signs from the only business almost as if to hide the fact that this is an entirely new business with a new owner selling a completely different product

not to mention all the delivery drivers that block both streets rather than using the generous parking lot in the rear and the business doesnt clear the sidewalks of snow in the winter so seniors and people with strollers and wheelchairs struggle to pass the building just zero effort to be part of the community

fast forward i instead had to pay the full price which is 7 more and when i asked the manager why i was paying full price she told me take out does not get the special price so dining in is cheaper then take out i have never seen that before i also told the manager they confirmed the 15 sale price over the phone and all she said was she will let the staff know not sure what that means but the service was horrible overall to top it off the pizza was horribly cut and i literally had to tear it with my hands as you can see in the right side of the photo horrible experience overall",-0.9607,Bad

portion sizes are reasonable to the price though there are some items that are certainly bangforthebuck the congee is spectacular for hamilton quality we have not experienced anything like this within the city confines and were sure to order it on every visit

as usual downtown parking is never thrilling but there is availability in rear lots and curbside if youre lucky but most of it will be paid unless you are willing to do a bit of a hike or its a weekendholiday

the staff there are attentive and friendly with years of exposure to the level of service at asian restaurantseateries i can say their service puts a smile on my face the atmosphere is inviting and the only area i would say is a bit lacking would be their washrooms theyre a bit dingy and is located downstairs would be a problem for those with accessibility needs this place accepts cash and card without a surcharge which is nice

i did notice some promotional offers on their tables one with a 10 discount offer and when i inquired about how to obtain it i was not given a very clear answer and left confused i had to do some digging on my own and my response to that would be if there are promotions available on the table then the staff should be aware of how to explain the promotion termsconditions",0.9589,Good

brought our family of 5 it started out strong with minimal wait on getting our drinks and food order placed however thats where it took a turn for the worse

i had ordered a house salad and soup for my mains which came out at the same time as everyone elses starters which ultimately left me sitting there awkwardly as everyone else ate after an ungodly long wait for their mains even after waiting so long the pastas were both rubbery and dry making 75 of the dishes inedible the pizza that came out was okay at best one of the kids said theirs was meh and the other commented saying its dry even the pineapple is dry my house salad i ordered due to the fact im vegetarian had a hair in it when i arrived which i decided to just eat around since our serverbartender was nowhere to be found later found bacon in it at which point i called it quits the tomato soup i ordered tasted like glorified tomato sauce overall was a waste of our time and money wont be back and wont order take out again due to the fact they clearly dont care and have subpar kitchen standards

when we went in i went to the cash and waited at least 7 minutes for an employee to come out when he did come out we were required to order off of the wall machines instead of ordering at the cash
we went ahead and tried to use the machines we got our order completed and when i proceeded to pay but their debit machine would not work it sent my order to the cash so i went up to ask to pay there in which i was able too thankfully
i noticed my order was double the price it said on the machine something was added to my order accidentally they said and  when i explained that is why i wanted to order at the cash because i prefer to place my order with an actual person rather than a machine the employee looked at me and said could you please go re order on the machines
i was extremely disappointed by this time i had already spent at least 25minutes in the store the employee was short with his words as well as rude he didnt show any concern or empathy at this point i just left the store

in my opinion service can determine if a business will make or break it as much as i enjoyed there stuff when i  ordered it for delivery i will never go back to ghost kitchens due to the experience i had today that employee ruined it for me and i wouldnt recommend going here to anyone they are far from accommodating",-0.7842,Bad

when i first went here they were still open for dine in and i loved how intimate the dining area was though its quite small its not often busy since covid they started doing takeout only they also usually give a discount when you pay with cash like most sushi places lately theyre doing a 20 discount on cash payments

they are a family owned business and have very kind customer service if youre ordering in a large group and getting one of the party trays youll be paying a bit less than other sushi places in the area however the size of their maki rolls are smaller than most places the quality can be hit or miss i have gone sometimes and found the fish didnt smell as fresh or that some pieces were a bit dry unfortunately

that being said my most recent experience with them was positive our order was ready on time we got a 20 discount for paying with cash and they packed a small container of soy sauce for each of us  we all like different levels of wasabi in our soy sauce so this was lovely most of our sushi pieces tasted fresh and the maki rolls all had a unique flavour to them which was nice

when we went in i went to the cash and waited at least 7 minutes for an employee to come out when he did come out we were required to order off of the wall machines instead of ordering at the cash
we went ahead and tried to use the machines we got our order completed and when i proceeded to pay but their debit machine would not work it sent my order to the cash so i went up to ask to pay there in which i was able too thankfully
i noticed my order was double the price it said on the machine something was added to my order accidentally they said and  when i explained that is why i wanted to order at the cash because i prefer to place my order with an actual person rather than a machine the employee looked at me and said could you please go re order on the machines
i was extremely disappointed by this time i had already spent at least 25minutes in the store the employee was short with his words as well as rude he didnt show any concern or empathy at this point i just left the store

just stopped here with family on my trip for dinner and wish i would have just stopped at a pizza hut and likely would have enjoyed the pizza there better spent over 150 and had an awful experience

my plates were wet and had to wipe them with tissues myself i asked for extra sauce and i could barely taste the sauce on my pizza my kids ordered pasta and they eat a few bites and refused to eat more and didnt want to take it home which is unusual for them my nachos where mostly half raw as if they werent fully baked the brand should really look into the quality of food served at this location

im editing this review to add to my miseries i just came to restroom and found no toilet paper when i went to wash hands one dispenser had no soap and another one was dripping soap on the counter and didnt look up to hygiene standards i work as a gm in retail and proud of the restroom areas we have in our store and how well we maintain them if there was a 5 star i would give it as a rating

club wrap 
i have this recent craving of sandwiches and wrap so i got a chicken wrap my fav type of protein it was so yummy as the combination of mayo sauce chicken and bacon goes so well together the lettuce and tomato also add a bit of freshness and cruchiness to the wrap totally should try this

home fries 
they also serve french fries or home fries with the wrap the difference between french fries and home fries is that frech fries are deep fried while home fries are seasoned and grilled i got the home fries this time it was perfect it was so soft and perfectly seasoned not so salty as i am writing this i am craving for it 

coffee 
a brunch with coffee is the best i got their coffee this time they allow refills as well i saw that there was a type of coffee that they serve is pretty special it is called greek iced frappe coffee i didnt get to try it this time but will do one day

fruit salad 
they also serve a lot of different types of sides like pancakes bacon strips and fruit salad they have two sizes of fruit salad small and large it is full of tropical fruits pineapples grapes watermelonetc

conveinience off all those separate items in one location 

but making all those menu items in one location must be fairly difficult you can only suspect that there are either 8 people in the back standing there waiting for orders or 1 dude that runs around to each station lol

this is probably why youll wait so much longer then you think you should

the food was pretty good the whipped feta dish could have used a longer cook on the roasted tomatoes the taco was excellent and the shrimp and calamari was heavy on the calamari and light on the shrimp

we ordered fried chicken and regular coffee our coffee was served without anything besides there was no trace of milk sugar or coffee spoon on the table we asked for milk for our coffee and it took six minutes to serve the milk for only one of us

the glass of water on the table was extremely cloudy it gave the feeling that it was dirty and had not been washed for a long time

our waiter was extremely welcoming and i liked her approach lets move on to the food we ordered fried chicken and it took a while to be served the taste of the chicken was great but it was very spicy so i dont think it was ideal for breakfast  the bacon was burnt and there was a piece of eggshell on my plate

the prices did not match at all compared to the food and service that was given to us considering that montreal is a brunch city and i have eaten a lot of brunches with better quality and lower prices in this city

honestly my expectation was much higher from a brunch spot that is so famous",0.9479,Good
Arthurs Nosh Bar,Breakfast and brunch,"4621 Notre-Dame St W, Montreal, QC H4C 1S5",QC,45.4734447,-73.5882848,5,"brunch at arthurs

lets address the elephant in the room the wait time so i was scrolling on the reviews of arthurs before going and i saw most of its negative reviews were about its long waiting time well guess what ive had to wait an hour too and i wasnt that mad about it after my brunch what do you expect from a small family owned breakfast place that is known for being the best brunch place on the island so if youre reading this review and you are impatient  then arthur aint for you if youre the opposite grab a protein bar and chill outside and wait as the others if you cant do that go somewhere else cause montreal isnt short on brunch places

now thats said lets move on to the foods we were a group of 3 the brunch and regular menu were available for us we ordered the moroccan toast the spicy fried chicken and smoked salmon from their brunch menu with a side of pancakes yes it did take some time to come but i didnt mind as we were having a great time talking with each over because of the places ambiance we even started talking with our neighbours and asking them for their choices on the menu their dishes reflect another level of quality everything was delicious from their coffee to their fried chicken everything were cooked to perfection the moroccan toast was a surprise for me the layers of flavour was amazing their pancakes are a must fried chicken wasnt even that greasy the beef bacon was a discovery for me and they dont miss on their hot sauce 

on to the service our waiter was really welcoming and attentive to us although he was busy with the other tables he always pass by ours to ask if we needed anything mind you that the brunch service happens every weekends and that place do not slow down your service team deserves all my praises 

when its comes to pricing arthurs is on the pricey side when it comes to brunch but their quality and quantity cant be compared to other places their smoked salmon is homemade and our waiter even explained to us where they get their beef bacon if youre a big group get all the dishes from the brunch menu as its worth the price if you want to share i also purchased a salami sandwich and really didnt mind the price as the quality was really good

overall brunch at arthurs was a first but not a last for me for me brunching with friends is to have a good time  great food and a great start of the day arthurs delivers just that with its quality dishes and amazing service",0.9975,Good

in this branch it was not

usually in ontario you get coffee top up and here they didnt offer us

something that made me nervous was the milk they figure it out annich told us but the decision is hard to take reputation of your brand or 6 sick customer that the milk was not good and offered us 3 new cappuccino but i told them be careful we are traveling and its not good to be sick with dieriha in a road trip

and he said yes i asked him to show me where it says no dogs he said on each entrance on doors i said lets go check because i said it doesnt he thought i became confrontational and radioed for back up i laughed at him and said because im questioning you you need back up he wouldnt go to the door to provide it then when i continued questioning him he threatened to have me trespassed i said for what asking to prove your policy he said its mall policy and we could go back to security office and hed show me i called him out on this and said lets go he said well thats a waste of time i said thats for me to decide his supervisor showed up and was very professional and deescalated the situation by taking the time to share with me that dogs were not allowed in the mall unless service dogs she agreed that courtesy desk was misinformed that represents the mall winners also allows dogs and the manger was all over our dog petting her and kissing her she said that she would have to speak to her then my wife went to home sense that allows dogs this is outside the mall and this was ok but still part of the pen centre then i returned to the mall to take care of what i intended to originally before this overzealous security guard confronted me and witnessed another dog in the mall in a a roller that was ok same security guard walked by and didnt say a word just a joke

i even talked to a few of the store managers in my shopping experience and was told that these security guards are hurting business with their commando attitude

do yourself a favour and go to the outlets pen centre has turned into a sub par mall and hiring sub par security is further hurting their already suspect business the mall has many empty stores and sub par stores courtesy desk  represents the mall not security that is contract hired i used to frequent the pen all the time not anymore do yourselves a favour and go to the outlet collection of niagara oh and i forgot to add when i said we called and said we had a toy poodle the security guard said oh that may be the problem you said toy poodle maybe they thought you called about a toy ya ok i called to see if i could bring a toy to the mall such stupidity pen centre your

more details used to come here quite a bit a few years ago but stopped when the black olives were off twice in a row now that pizza pizza doesnt offer whole grain crust anymore decided to try ginos again since they have whole wheat tried to order using their website you cant view their toppings or other options unless you create an account first which is super annoying the order  interface doesnt tell you which items cost extra so its a crapshoot to see if the pizza is going to cost what you think pesto sauce is 350 extra on a medium pizza for example after all that you cant even pay online why force people to get an online account just to see the menu if you wont let them pay online

anyway went to pick up the pizzas place smells really gross now  has a really strong mildew smell as another reviewer noted the guys hands werent clean who handled payment but they just appeared to be dirty with flour so gave the benefit of the doubt on that

the last two or three times i ate at bk i think it was in new brunswick and in quebec i was surprised about the quality of their burgers they were not garnished very generously and they were served cold like they had been made hours before the last place i had a whopper before i tried this location they had barely put a sliver of tomato a small piece of lettuce and just one ring of a slice of onion this was no whopper and it didnt taste like one

my experience at this location on montreal road in ottawa was like going back in time and tasting a whopper like it tasted years ago it was a perfectly built burger with generous toppings complete with loads of ketchup and mayonnaise dripping with tangy flavourful juices that flame broiled burger flavour served hot and juicy just like they use to do it at all the locations 20 years ago ill be back for more delicious memories thank you for conserving the traditional whopper with cheese flavour this is the real thing",0.9825,Good

one area of improvement would be the selection of nonalcoholic drinks which was somewhat limited it would be nice to see a wider variety of options in that regard on the other hand i must commend the kitchen on the fantastic calamari it was cooked to perfection and had a delicious flavor that left me wanting more
however i found the ravioli with shrimp to be a bit too sweet for my taste while it may appeal to those who enjoy sweeter flavors i personally would have preferred a more balanced taste

first and foremost the injera a traditional ethiopian flatbread was not up to par it had a rather unpleasant sour taste which took away from the overall enjoyment of the meal one of the spinach side dishes too was sour and i stayed away from a second helping of that dish

to make matters worse one of my friends found a fly in their drink attached is the picture of it this was not only unappetizing but also a major hygiene concern its unacceptable for a restaurant to serve beverages with insects in them and it definitely affected our dining experience worst part the waitress initially argued that it wasnt a fly until she saw it herself

but the most disturbing incident occurred when our waitress dipped her finger tip into our drink to scoop something out this was a complete breach of basic food handling practices and left us feeling extremely uncomfortable its essential for the staff to maintain proper hygiene standards and this incident was a glaring violation

given these experiences i regret to say that i would not consider returning to harambe ethiopian restaurant the issues we encountered were too significant to overlook and they greatly impacted our overall impression of the place i value cleanliness quality and attentive service when dining out and unfortunately this restaurant failed to meet these expectations

i hope the management of harambe ethiopian restaurant takes these concerns seriously and works towards improving their food quality and hygiene practices until then i would advise potential diners to exercise caution when considering this establishment for a meal",-0.9754,Bad

2	if you need a chicken curry dish which tastes homemade this dish is it again the chicken was soft and tender the curry was amazing not overly sweet or savory the flavors of the onion tomato and spices were just perfect it really tasted like comfort food something you could have on a cold rainy day and not feel guilty
3	the rice was just a typical order of rice this was probably the first time ive ordered rice cooked with peas from an indian restaurant i didnt mind it but if you dont like peas then dont order the rice

Pho Tru (Blanshard St),Vietnamese,"1012 Blanshard St, Victoria, BC V8T 2M1",BC,48.4238401,-123.3628441,4,"came here by default as we were trying to find another restaurant but these guys were closer 
we ordered steak vermicelli spring rolls 62 rare beef and beef ball phở side rice 1 viet coffee 1 side saté broth and 3 tea came to 70ish
the postives the spring rolls are probably some of the best ive had in north america ive eaten viet all over the grilled steak for the vermicelli dish my mom had was tasty and tender i especially enjoyed the shallots and cilantro i the bowl
the meat for the phở was fresh and tasty their saté phở while its not authentic  was fullbodied and different from the style of saté ive had in ab with coconut milk added
the negatives my broth wasnt hot enough for me i like to scald my tongue the saté broth was though the vietnamese coffee needed more of a stronger brew on the amount of water it lacked the thickness you need of a strong espresso brewed viet coffee also while the regular broth had a good amount of the spice blend it lacked the beefy bone umami tasted a bit bland you need the big bold bone flavor and a little bit of the fat from the marrow for a wellrounded bowl of phở
id go back for the spring rolls and vermicelli and maybe the saté
also the price is a little steep for what i usually pay
dont come for the ambiance unless you want the ambiance of true vietnam styles",0.9898,Good

i discussed with the owner he suggested the malai kofta is their best dish and so we tried he categorically did not include paneer dishes
the malai kofta was only potato and gravy was also not very tasty the whole experience was tardy we had orders for togo in evening around 3pm in july restaurant was not busy  so any dish could be given with proper attention
its sad to see there are folks fooling around for indian dishes 
certainly i will never go to this restaurant again

the bad the food itself was just ok the service was good but the food was slowwe were waiting long enough between courses that we were starting to doze off at the table

there were distracting andor weird aspects of most of the dishes we really liked the flavor of the mushroom dishfried king oyster slices on a bed of puréed cauliflower with coffee and chocolate with a very nice veggie demiglacebut the actual mushrooms themselves were stringy and tough the smoked fish with veggies marinated in shrimp paste was interesting but overly heavy and saltybright pickled cucumbers helped but werent enough to overcome the heaviness and muddled flavors the beef tenderloin had great flavor but also had a big chunk of sinew down the side which made for a very chewy experience

the wines overall were mostly fun and nicely varied but they leaned a little heavily toward the funkyweird side which got a little tiring later in the meal

what i dont understand is how you can have a 20 minute wait when you only have 12 other customers in the entire restaurant if this is a staff issue it needs to be addressed asap
what boggles my mind even further is that even after the wait the chicken in my butter chicken bowl was still cold the sauce was hot the bowl was warm the naan was hot so what happened to the chicken
the icing on this terrible cake is that i paid 15 for what is effectively a bowl of rice sauce cold chicken and a few small pieces of naan

we ordered the palak paneer butter chicken lamb biryani with a couple of naans and sides of plain rice as well as coconut rice
the paneer dish was great spice level spot on  the other dishes that were our usual picks were unfortunately not great  the butter chicken lacked its depth of flavour and the biryani was a tad dry flavours were there but it was as if the volume was turned way down  lamb itself was decent but biryani is usually a bit more moist and comes with a side of raita but tonight it didnt
the coconut rice was interesting not sure if thats their own version but it had fried bits of the coconut cream which lent a toasty flavour but left the rice quite oily  and then the naans  oh dear it was nothing like weve had before when the naan is sort of light and bubbly almost  it was the opposite  the naan were like flat bread  thick and heavy

yakitori chicken completely unseasoned was it boiled bland green onions were soggy oh and to top it off the sauce spilled through the container all on the bottom of the bag and on my furniture

spider tempura the sauce i think it is straight vinegar for some perspective partner is a huge fan of salty sour and vinegary things salt and vinegar on fries potato chips puts 10 sour skittles in his mouth at a time will eat the sugar on the bottom too and eats plain feta with nothing else he said it was too much

and the crab itself i paid 10 dollars for a miniscule portion now i understand seafood and fried things are oily but this was dripping soggy like applesauce or a wet cracker and i think they fried it with the shell on but i could be wrong how is it tempura if you dont get to eat the artery clogging fried bits i tried it i really did it made me slightly nauseous you would have to pay me very handsomely to take another bite

heard of this place in town went to check it out and it was packed since it was the new place in town i get it why it was so busy made 2 orders and it took about 1520 mins they did forget about one of my order but when i reminded about them they got to it immediately and even gave me 2 extra sandwich for the delay so i really appreciate them for that food tasted really great especially those honey biscuits were crazy good the only reason i gave 4 stars is because they forgot the fries in one order and the sauces however ill give this place another try since its just the first week",0.8008,Good

i found this place on google maps and they went the extra mile to come and try it out it took us half an hour to get there but it was totally worth it the chinese burger here is incredibly delicious and reminds me of the ones i used to have near the school gates back in my childhood days in china they even use the same griddle for cooking the burgers just like in china i never thought i would find that nostalgic taste here in canada and it truly touched my heart

the korean sandwich is also fantastic with a generous portion size i highly recommend trying their authentic osakastyle okonomiyaki it tasted exactly like the ones i had in japan i feel incredibly lucky to have found this place

the owner of the store is very kind and friendly they shared many stories with us adding to the overall wonderful experience i sincerely hope they continue to enjoy a happy life and prosperous business what i want to say is that every dish they serve aligns perfectly with my taste buds i will be recommending this place to all my friends as you deserve more customers as long as im living in windsor i will definitely come back here lots of times",0.9985,Good

not sure if its the speaker system or a problem with multi tasking but theres usually misscommunication and a need to pay again for missed items most times you dont get a receipt or you have to ask for it if something is missing theres no real option to make it right once youre home even if a manager writes it down for pick up at a later date the workers wont know what youre talking about

the burgers are more steamed and less grilled now i think and turned out to be grey moist pieces of meat the nuggets are usually dried out and fries are a hit and miss leaning towards undercookedoily

im okay paying for extra sauces mcdonalds always gets their money but they usually dont make it into the bag if you notice after leaving drive thru and sometimes right at the window theyll expect you to pay for more if you dont hold firm ive had a worker get huffy about it more than a few times you can empty the bags in front of the sauce police and they still assume youre trying to get 2 free sauces

vibe
its a cute and quirky little restaurant featuring gnomes and dwarf decor arrangements it was cozy inside and on the top floor there was a local gift shop the shop sold cute little knickknacks from handmade jewelry pins to anime buttons and stickers

service
the service was pretty good for having to deal with all 10 of us and we didnt have to wait too long to get seated the only downfall was that one of the drinks we ordered didnt quite match up to the description of the menu on their website we ordered from some of the food items or specials on the website were not on the menu either but were still available to order

food
what we were intentionally drawn with by choosing to eat at this restaurant were the playful drinks the zelda themed drinks were fun and we would have no idea about these drinks if not for checking the website

onigiri combo takoyaki  3 choices of onigiri which i chose 1tuna mayo 2 karage 3 shrimp tempura and it came with a miso soup and 6 pieces of regular takoyaki the onigiris were huge and i ended up only being able to finish one and taking the rest home to go the takoyaki came out with floating pieces of the bonito flakes waving in the air as expected the miso soup was very rich in flavor and i dont think i ever had sesame in miso soup before

drinks
milkshake shingenmochi with black sugar syrup  this drink is very delicious and sweet with the black sugar syrup and chewy mochis

master sword  cold sake calpico and club soda mix with a master sword iced jelly the master sword jelly gets floppy pretty quickly when left out too long so its best to take the pics quick and then stir the drink with the master sword

hearty elixir  peach redbull and red coloring its a tangy and pretty refreshing drink for the summer

blue jelly sake soda  i found the blue jelly was fun to stir around in my drink but the blue jelly itself tasted pretty bland and not that great with the sake its nice for photos only

apple popping boba sake  this was an alright tasting drink and it only made it better with the popping bobas the light hitting the bobas made the drink look radioactive and was fun to take pics of

i would go here again just to try their other dishes everything looked and sounded so good we all had trouble choosing what to get

but youre there for the food and the food was pretty good not as spicy as i like it but tasty nonetheless while we were there there was a steady stream of food delivery guys so they certainly appeared to be doing good business via one of the food delivery apps the portions are also huge but while its good i think think i would rather go to akins the food is good but its not the only thing about going out and atigas sole strength seems to be only the food i havent even talked about the quality of the service or how there was no itemised bill nevermind all that the building itself needs at least a lick of paint if only to brighten it up and make it more welcoming",0.967,Good

aside from going to experience the high tea life we were also sending off a friend who was moving and they were very accommodating and made that occassion very special i would definitely go back to do it again

the hotel does have street parking but they also have a parkade richardson centre parkade  googleable to map to i used the parkade and paid about 12 for 25 hrs i believe its 2 for every 30 mins and 14 for daily they do not validate parking although it would be nice if they did",0.99,Good

i have in the past given the velvet glove though renamed vg restaurant 5 stars it continues to hold it

i went twice in a relatively short time frame
on my previous visit we were allowed to order from the new fall menu we did milk buns pickerel fritters tomato salad  bison tartare strip loin porchetta peanut butter dessert and cake for two
the milk buns were a great highlight they no longer serve a bread basket however
on this visit i tried the vegan menu and had the cauliflower fritters gnocchi boudha bowl and the cake
the cauliflower fritters and the gnocchi were outstanding i do not believe they are on the regular menu but i dont see why not  i am not a vegan as you can tell from my first visit but i think these two items would do well on their regular menu
regardless of vegan fritter or pickerel fritter you cant go wrong with either i personally wasnt as much a fan of the tomato salad that night but i think that was just personal taste i think i have to be in a certain mood for it as it is pickled the bison tartare was a solid choice
i enjoyed the porchetta but i feel it is more a sharing dish unless you have someone who very much likes to eat a lot of pork it is a very large piece of meat and as much as i love meat for myself it was too heavy i liked the variety and the sides we received with the strip loin
out of the desserts i was a fan of the peanut butter one but that is personal preference my friend ate the cake for two by herself which i think says how good that was

previous review 
my meal tonight was outstanding it was part of a special menu the local authentic experience
aside from the service going above and beyond the food plating presentation and flavors were all fantastic its been a long time since ive had a meal this good in winnipeg my other recollection would be segovia which is in the canadas 100 best list
their price point is also friendlier than some other high end restaurants with comparable level of quality

dinner includes parking but you do need to get it validated before you leave valet as well as self park lunch does not
dinner is only open friday and saturday",0.9975,Good

what truly sets freshslice pizza apart is their commitment to customer satisfaction not only was my pizza cooked to perfection with no burnt spots on the top but they also left a heartwarming note with my order the oneonone free option they offer is fantastic and even though there was a minor issue with a burnt pizza in my previous order which was promptly resolved their thoughtfulness shone through with a sweet message on the box accompanied by a sticky note saying hope its ok with you today

while i cant compare this particular pizza to my usual timings i can confidently say that freshslice pizza consistently delivers on taste quality and customer service the flavors were robust the crust was just right and the combination of ingredients was a burst of deliciousness in every bite

rating  15

i recently had a terrible experience at gravity cafe that i feel compelled to share as a regular customer who frequently purchases coffee from this establishment i expected to receive at least a basic level of customer service unfortunately my recent encounter with one of their employees left me extremely disappointed and frustrated

upon visiting gravity cafe i found myself in urgent need of using the restroom due to a medical condition involving my short bladder i approached a staff member a young woman who i believe was named a tiny white girl and politely requested to use their restroom for a quick visit however instead of showing any empathy or understanding she rudely denied me access leaving me feeling humiliated and disrespected

as a customer i understand that businesses may have certain policies in place regarding restroom usage however it is the responsibility of the employees to handle such situations with professionalism and kindness this particular employee at gravity cafe failed miserably in this regard displaying a complete lack of customer service skills

denying someone access to a restroom especially when it is a matter of urgency is not only insensitive but also reflects poorly on the establishment as a whole it is disheartening to witness such behavior from an employee who represents the cafe to its customers

gravity cafe should recognize that the success of their business depends on the satisfaction of their customers by employing individuals who lack basic empathy and professionalism they are jeopardizing their reputation and driving away loyal patrons like myself no customer should have to endure such disrespectful treatment

i hope that gravity cafe takes this review seriously and addresses the issue promptly it is essential to train their staff to handle customer requests with respect and understanding until then i cannot recommend this cafe to anyone as i have lost faith in their ability to provide satisfactory customer service

overall my recent experience at gravity cafe was nothing short of disappointing the behavior of their employee was not only rude but also reflected a complete disregard for customer wellbeing it is my sincere hope that they take immediate action to rectify this situation and prevent future occurrences",0.9593,Good

 one of my favourite cafes of calgary as of late
 amazing interior with tons of seating and immense green living vibes
 not only do they have a common group seating area with couches and hightop tables they also have a more private section with even more seating for those study dates and private chats as well as some outdoor seating
 im only docking a couple points because their choice of coffee beans arent my favourite but your mileage may vary and the quality of each drink varies a lot depending on whos making it

i give six stars out of five so i dont have to down regulate all the other good schwarmas in the city
ive been here twice now and met the manager inder both times
he is very polite attentive eager and friendly
i asked a bunch of questions and he answered them all patiently

both times i ordered a mix beefschwarma wrap with a little lettuce reg tomatoes extra onion and a couple pickles medium hot sauce with sweet garlic sauce
the first few bites with no sauce i found the meat incredibly juicy and tender with the most amazing spice combo
its good all on its own with no sauce or spice
the garlic is subtle with a perfect relative amount of sweetness
they make their own hot sauces and i gotta say the medium was a true medium not too spicy with a little taste to it

i also ordered an osmows special
its like a montfort chicken if you ever graced montfort mediterranean cuisine in oakville on
its a pita wrap with chicken and pineapple i ordered it with a little lettuce extra onions and extra garlic sauce
oh my this is the best sandwich ever

the place is set up with a good flow nice lighting and colours also the bathrooms were clean that means a lot to me

the pizza crust is crunchy the toppings are generous and sometimes unique as well eg dill pickles and bacon pizza

onto the food itself i ordered the pizza and to be frank it failed to impress while it wasnt terrible it certainly didnt stand out as anything special or noteworthy especially for its price point given the numerous dining options available in kensington i would go elsewhere

i found the server sunni to be a bit not so sunny she asked us to leave one of the patio tables because we ordered take out when we ordered we intended to eat by the river as it was a hot sunny day but as it was completely empty there and in the shade so we sat down on of the patio chairs to eat a slice or two i found it pretty odd to kick out your literal only 2 patrons because they ordered takeout just poor business decision making on the mashs part why leave a bad taste in your customers mouths i guess we found out why there is nobody there on a beautiful saturday evening at 6pm with that said i see know reason to go here over the many better places in kensington so i would skip this one",-0.7404,Bad

when i received my plate there was a tone of fries and my sandwich consisted of this  thick slice of toasted white bread a thin slice of chicken it was white and sliced like thin slice of ham another thick slice toasted white bread a tiny piece of lettuce tiny barely covered any of my pieces of the sandwich a thin slice of tomato a few pieces of bacon and another thick slice of toasted white bread

the sandwich was dry as there was barely any mayo on it

the plate came to a cost of approximately 1695 i cant remember the exact price

most of my meal was left behind i took all the middle sliced toast out of the sandwich and condensed the ingredients together the sandwich was so small it would not have fed a five year old child

this sandwich made me wonder if this was the reason that my plate was full of fries hide the fact that the sandwich was not worth two cents

my husband ordered a filet of sole he was also disappointed he told me it was overcooked and very dry he also asked what was up with all the fries

then came the  desert my motherinlaw was raving about how good the rice pudding was  she ordered and received her desert less then a minute later sprinkled with cinnamon

i looked at it and could tell right away it was all wrong  the rice was floating in a white liquid in the bowl

Sub World,Vegetarian,"3 Elgin St, Greater Sudbury, ON P3C 5B7",ON,46.49462,-80.9967487,2,"this used to be my favorite chicken caesar sub place
last night i ordered through doordash and was disappointed that you cant edit your options for your subs im not sure who is responsible for that if its the restaurant or the ap and the main thing the fam wanted was cauliflower bites but they were out of stock and got subbed for sweet potato fries without my approval i think thats an ap issue though however had i known that were out of stock i would have ordered elsewhere because that was the main thing we wanted
the chicken caeser sub included sliced tomatoes which is both weird and gross to me shaved chicken slices instead of grilled chicken breast like one would expect and dare i say too much of it the bacon was burned luckily i like it that way but not everyone does and there was not enough dressing the most surprising part though is the scant amount of lettuce in it im including a picture though it doesnt really show it that well
we had onion rings that could have been cooked a little longer
i also ordered the maple garden salad but it came with what i believe was a balsamic vinaigrette instead of maple it also included shredded cheese not listed as an ingredient which i personally love but my vegan family members didnt
i ordered the maple chocolate cake and a nanimo bar the cake was half frozen and dry and the nanimo tasted old
the fam didnt say anything about the wedges so they must have been okay
the poutine was pretty good
i dont think ill be ordering from there again which makes me sad",0.9807,Good

strike number two was when i was working an evening shift not closing and my shift ended so i clocked out and walked past the front counter towards the door as i was about to head out the manager called out to me to do some other task and i called back that my shift finished and i have to get picked up yeah after that i wasnt scheduled for any shifts i asked why and the manager claimed i was being let go because apparently i was within a 6momth disciplinary period where they can let me go for any reason and didnt have to tell me why i wasnt told this at any point i pushed for more details on why i was being let go as i felt i was doing a good job and the above two strikes are what i was told months later i think back on this employment with regret and question the legality of it no kidding the turnover rate was high

first most of the reviews and the photos here are incorrect  they are for the other original location in killarney this location is in a dingy land locked strip mall plaza not near water with no exterior seating  not the quaint free standing building shown in some photos

good the fish was great  we came here because local trout and pickerel are the fish they use not haddock or halibut like you usually find  lots of smaller pieces lightly battered  decent amount of fresh cut french fries

bad sticky tables and slow service  was told 20 min but ended up being 40  i dont mind being told its going to be longer for fresh made but lets be honest  it would be better if they actually outlined on the menu what type of fish you were going to get since people typically expect halibut  location and decor are poor  prices are also much higher than average

ugly so this is what destroyed our experience  i split open two different pieces of fish and brought them up to the cash to ask the guy what type of fish each of these were  he proceeds to pick it up and poke each one while telling me what they are  this is right after handling the cash  i was shocked  now if thats what he did i was worried what things were like in the back  lets hope the cooks hygiene was better  this is why i hate tipping at the cash when you first purchase",-0.3921,Bad

585 weber st n 4 waterloo ontario
conveniently located by fit4less

the slice may look typicalbut obviously as the old phase goes looks can be very deceiving
biting into the pizza is the first introduction into something is very special the pizza shell doesnt have the typical cardboarddrywall texture it actually has a consistency of dense but fluffy naan bread i tried to compliment the staff the other day but i think a language barrier just made it seem like an insult lets take another bite theres something different something out of the ordinary chew it a bit more move it around the tongue right its the sauce its not the basic open the typical pizza sauceyes its homemade with spices and garlic added very nice
now lets nibble on the pepperoni something is different again a bolder taste less greasyohh its beef pepperoni what a relief pork is an unhealthy animal and protein to consume for many various reasons that i encourage others to do their own personal research on just like us swine also store their toxins in their fat and what do we consume most of in the pig

even though i havent had their specialty pizza yet like the butter chicken pizza or obviously the company name pizza shawarma i certainly smelled its lovely essence

ive had some of the spiciest hot chicken available in nashville it was so spicy it made me blush sweat cry and get a runny nose while i ate it even my stomach could tell how hot it was

whatever pathetic chicken i was sold here could have been outdone with nothing more than freshly cracked black pepper

this chicken was so lame i wish i had ordered kfc because if i had at least i would only have myself to blame for how pathetic the food i paid for was

the only reason im okay with having to leave 1 star is because the mac n cheese wasnt completely appalling dont get me wrong it wasnt good i just cant definitively say it wasnt the most pathetic excuse for mac n cheese ive ever had the chicken though was by far the most pathetic excuse for hot chicken ive ever had",-0.9816,Bad

it was a friday night and so service was busy which is understandable however the food is overly greasy over priced and to be honest i can make food at home much better the only reason why we went out for dinner was because we received a gift card from the holidays i know for a fact that the majority of the food comes in frozen boxes or bags which then are simply reheated either using a microwave or quickly reheat it in a frying pan absolutely nothing at this restaurant is fresh except for a salad and vegetables

after receiving the food i politely asked the server for chilli flakes and you can see in the pictures how i received it covered in someone elses disgusting greasy fingerprints and this is exactly showing the start this restaurant is in disrepair and needs a fresh coat of paint steamed carpets and overall decor needs to be cleaned and dusted

within the bathroom one of the stalls toilet paper dispenser was broken and the one thing i dont want to do is to touch a roll of single ply very thin toilet paper that previous occupants have touched with their bacteria covered hands in addition in the washroom two out of the four sinks were not working as you can see the state of the disrepair of the bathroom the counters floors mirrors were covered in water primarily because both paper towel dispensers for empty within my hour and a half i visited the washroom twice which no staff members came by to refill the paper towel dispenser or took time to clean would you can especially see in the last photo of the handle of the door of the washroom it is covered with greasy fingerprints liquid dripping down the door and an array of weird brown colours splattered all over the tiled wall

my closing thoughts are that the owner and management do not care boston pizza has no passion in the food that they make it is not fresh and is reheated microwaved food you all need to step up and do better

dont waste your money here go somewhere nice like a family run business anywhere else but here would have more passion then with this location is doing",0.902,Good

about 10 years ago it was good even 67 years ago it was good and my wife and i would go there with friends it was not my favourite but it was good

the last two times i have been to this place the soy sauce was incredibly salty appears that i am not the first reviewer to mention this i have never experienced soy sauce this salty in my life today i tried to ask if they had a low sodium option but the first person walked away from me while i was asking it was a do you have any other soy ok youre walking away from me the second person was quite helpful and told me there was a no sodium option he brought it over it tasted like bad wine or beer that has been in a can for a few years not something you want to dip your sushi into

i love octopus but there was no octopus on the lunch menu

the spicy sushi was quite boring and not spicy at all i do not like the places that put tempura in it but this one was mostly rice and one small piece of salmon wrapped in a piece of seaweed that was too large for what it contained

at the end i could not finish the sushi i was given due to taste rather than being full it was the worst food experience i have had at a restaurant in years

as for atmosphere maybe it was a slow day but in the past we would be sat throughout the restaurant when i came today around 2 pm all customers were sequestered to the left side when you walk in of the restaurant makes sense to have things easier for servers but it really stuck with me that there were not even enough people to fill the rest

168 sushi in waterloo is a much better option for ayce they even have an outdoor patio but i would rather buy a sushi tray from zehrs or wal mart than go back to this place",0.9467,Good

we were expecting good pizza however we were sorely surprised i ordered the twin large with extra cheese on one it was overcooked and there was so little cheese you could see most of the dough and sauce the pizza dough through the cheese was even toasted
the crust itself was really good and probably would have been a fantastic pizza had some care gone into it

when the issue was brought up to the employees at the counter they proceed to mumble some excuse about adding extra patties that made absolutely no sense whatsoever  proceed to make me another burger the replacement burger was absolutely no better it was overcooked  dry

what i can say is i could smell their place from the candy shop nearby and it instantly gets to your gut   when i went inside the atmosphere somewhat modern but not tacky i knew whomever ran this place has passion watching them cook and prep they care   i cant wait to go back thank you again for your hospitality i hope others in the area and tourists see what a hidden gem this is

first off on the positive
nice meaty wings pleasant delivery person

on the negative
medium and hot sauces are bbq based not your typical buffalo or peppered hot sauce
french fries are wedges and even when we selected the crispy  option they were not that crisp maybe you like wedges not me
gravy is a gravy sauce not a true thick gravy
tortilla chips are not corn based i dont believe they mention that they are tasty but i was looking for corn
veggies were okay but they slice super giant carrots which are known to be a lot tougher than smaller carrots

if you are searching for affordable quality and quantity in asian cuisine this is right place
also service was excellent with minor touches and clean space i didnt feel they are trying to conserve but rather comfortable with entire dinning time
though i wish there was bit more variety to the soup and not majorly pork base if customizable using veg broth or chicken broth would be 5
i hope the owners continues to maintain the standard and price range to make it possible for everyone to appreciate the goodness in this lovely town",0.9846,Good

finally on a cold winter sunday evening i landed there to buy rice
the smell of the food attracted me i decided to get the fish plate they had several interesting and exotic things on the menu

the dish i ordered cost me around 16 it was fish grilled tilapia served with atiéké plantain and salad
everything was tasty the way they grilled the fish is just like in my home country

it is also served with sauce and a very tiny portion of hot chilli sauce im a big fan of capsaicin so i found this chilli is a big bonus
the plantain was cooked very well it was sweet and crispy at the same time i can finish a box of plantain only

unfortunately im not a big an of atiéké it tastes sour somehow and it wasnt suitable with my palate

at the end i cooked the rice that i had bought earlier there it was rice from mali the brand of the rice is sada it has special fragrance the grains were slim and the rice is sticky

im overall satisfied with my purchase

Pink Bow Restaurant,Japanese,"6791 50 Avenue, Unit 19, Red Deer, AB T4P",AB,52.2916293,-113.8124966,5,"what lacks in popularity is none other than a restaurant as hidden as this because you are sure to hit a mouthwatering taste of japans specialties and richness of flavor meet the pink bow restaurant a classic but modern take on the ramen or eastern cuisine business aligned with oishidesu ramen which is another ramen restaurant it missed the spot in the quantity and quality control of the food

thats where pink comes in as the ramen ive ordered here tonkotsupork has a distinct flavor of smoky and tender juiciness imbuing itself into the broth the egg that came along with it also gives a balance of salty and savory as it has been in a brine based on my visual judgement to tell me they put love into that the noodles also arent super thin or yeasty as you would see in packets which is a big plus if you tell me the crepe is an interesting one it is very light yet somehow very filling the combination of fruits and dessert dressings provided that they can also be the main course tricks your brain into thinking you are full but arent the drink that ive been offered is a bubble tea fusion for the philippines ie halohalo a special deal for those looking at that sweet taste of the ube purple yam

atmosphere wise it is modern but it might need to emphasize more on the japanese aspect the lucky cat curtains is kinda cute not gonna lie the lights are pleasant alongside a chalkboard of the many ways to get exclusive discounts no you cannot just openly say youre this or that unless you prove it the size of the restaurant from a certain point of view are sized like the alleyway ramen shops in japan so how else would it not be small there is also some wall decals with the biggest eye catcher being the flow of leaves coming off a tree

their sizes are also misleading a medium pizza is 12 inches but they sell a 10 inch medium

how much bigger is a 12 inch pizza than a 10inch pizza about 44 larger considering the area of the pie the area of a round pie is proportional to the square of the diameter the diameter of a 12 inch pie is 12 times the diameter of a 10 inch pie and 12 squared is 144 or 44  larger

the last few weeks ive ordered take out once and dined in once

when i ordered take out the for my whole family 5x i ordered chicken tenders and fries for my 2 girls they chicken was way way over fried also ordered 2 asparagus garlic and salmon pasta the one was great but the one piece of salmon was so over cooked and charred
decided to dine in today first off im heavily pregnant due in 5 days and i was seated at a booth so uncomfortable i again asked for the summer seasonal of asparagus garlic and salmon with them telling me they are all out of pasta hows that possible my son ordered pasta chicken alfredo but they are out i seen recent reviews this is not the first time they have been out of this dish our waiter also tucked us way in the se corner never asked to refill our drinkswe sat almost the whole time without drinksempty cups barley checked on us i was so frustrated with the last 2 experiences so i settled for a steak and potatoes with veggies the asparagus was so bitter the potatos were so salty and having nothing to drink made it hard to keep eating them

i ordered pasta which had the line add salmon but it was frozen how you can remember as for me the pasta was raw and asparagus with bitterness im upset with my choice

my boyfriend ordered a double bacon double cheese cheeseburger but they brought us another burger which had neither cheese nor bacon we told the waitress about this but she said that the chef simply forgot to add bacon i dont like it when they try to make fools out of us and instead of saying that we gave you someone elses burger well say that lets bring you bacon to your burger in the check it was bacon cheesburger as it turned out without cheese and without bacon  we were offered a dessert at their expense but we are not lovers of desserts

its been a long time since ive eaten such a delicious pasta  it was real pasta  excited to try other pasta

and the chicken is real korean style chicken it is very juicy and soft when hot and even delicious when cold  especially the yangyum sauce was delicious  must try either side or cover the chicken

the barbecue platter has so much meat that you can never finish it alone  if you cant eat a lot i recommend sharing it with two people

Au Coin du Vietnam,Vietnamese,"1530 Rue Galt O, Sherbrooke, QC J1H 2B4",QC,45.3867007,-71.9129043,2,"placed order through ubereats and arrived in less than 30 minutes

my grilled meat was 2 pieces cheap beef steak hard not marinated and very dry the fried rice wasnt really fried no crispiness and full of soy sauce and fish sauce the vegetables were alright

the meal came with a salad shredded lettuce carrots and cabbage no vinaigrette as far as i could tell and 2 imperial rolls i replaced the rolls for a shrimp donut that was tasty in the meal box was a slice of lime and very liquid sweet chili sauce or maybe something else but it had almost no flavor so i didnt use it

i also ordered the spring roll which i thought was pretty expensive and it turns out it was that roll had almost no meat in it like 5g of pork and 3 small shrimps and the peanut sauce that came with it had no peanut flavors im not even sure what i ate to be honest

it was edible hence why i gave it 2 stars but i can make a better fried rice at home and grilled some decent piece of beef for 30
the fried rice meat and vegetables were supposed to be aromatized with lemongrass but i barely tasted it they probably used dry lemongrass seasoning which has almost no flavor

overall not a great experience for the price and im a fan of thai cuisine i cook a lot of thai dishes at home and that was just not it opening the box and seeing 2 piece of 1 steak was a great disappointment",0.9444,Good

this particular establishment didnt appear to be cleanliest i worked within the food industry btw as well as managed a commercial cleaning company i know what i am talking about
i relate the cleanliness problem to the staff being too young and inexperienced this establishment is newly built the mens bathroom door needs a good wiping down you can see greasy hand prints and dirt on it countertops floors etc need to be wiped down more often it isnt the worst kind of dirt for a food establishment but this is not a good sign for a restaurant and building that is brand new it indicates where it is heading

i also wasnt impressed with 3 herb plants in pots on top of their sink with hotel pans steel storage containers with the picked herbs from the plants within them this is odd for a restaurant if i were the owner i would be worried about eventually receiving a visit from a health inspector

the soup the thai racha chicken was sitting in a soup of juice because no rice which honestly shouldnt happen either it usually sits on a bed of white rice i received was funny until that point
professional answer would have been to just check the box they come in and let me know if theyd answer the phone we could have kept it between us

bryannahs warm and friendly demeanor made us feel welcome right away she took the time to explain the menu and made excellent recommendations based on our preferences her knowledge of the dishes and willingness to accommodate our dietary needs was impressive it was evident that she genuinely cared about our satisfaction and went above and beyond to ensure we had a memorable meal

throughout the evening bryannah remained attentive without being intrusive she always had a smile on her face and promptly attended to any requests or questions we had her efficiency and professionalism were truly remarkable and it made the overall dining experience even more enjoyable

one piece of advice i would give to those considering dining at montanas is to visit midweek during our visit the restaurant was relatively quiet allowing bryannah to provide personalized attention to each table it was evident that the midweek atmosphere allowed the staff to focus more closely on their guests resulting in an even more delightful dining experience

in terms of the food montanas did not disappoint the menu offered a wide range of mouthwatering options and the quality of the dishes was superb from the succulent ribs to the perfectly cooked steaks every bite was a delight to the taste buds the portions were generous and the presentation was visually appealing

overall my experience at montanas was exceptional and much of that credit goes to bryannah for her exceptional service her friendly and caring nature coupled with her attention to detail truly elevated our dining experience i highly recommend visiting montanas and if you have the opportunity being served by bryannah just remember for the best experience try to visit midweek when the restaurant is less crowded you wont be disappointed",0.9986,Good

curry chicken 8410 not sure if its the best ive had but extremely close no bones which i appreciated but that makes it not authentic

curry goat 8210 never had it would recommend it

oxtail 8510 had difficulty telling the difference between this and the curry goat embarrassingly so i called someone  jamaicans dont curry oxtail i was told so then i knew the difference it was my first time and it tastes like a fatties roast beef that melts off the bone i see the appeal

jerk chicken 7410 this score isnt reflected by the fact i didnt get steamed fish it was good but unspectacular spices didnt stsnd out and i tasted mostly pepper wasnt bad at all but was expecting more

steamed vegetables 7810 was surprised and i could probably eat them straight which is something i normally wouldnt say

coleslaw 710 meh nothing to write home about

beef patties 8810 i had a homemade one of these years back and wasnt into them but this was really good the meat was almost pasty but really good

festivals 8410 kind of like strips of bannocksasass with sugar but not sweat enough to be a donut was great for dipping

roti 8510 never had fresh roti but this was really good reminded me of a warm giant folded thicker tortilla great for dipping or eating straight

rice  beans 7910 most commented thing online and was good but i felt like i could make or have better wasnt something id seek out but im glad i had it

mango carrot juice 8110 its a brand lots of sugar in it but i dont think it good and would recommend

bryannahs warm and friendly demeanor made us feel welcome right away she took the time to explain the menu and made excellent recommendations based on our preferences her knowledge of the dishes and willingness to accommodate our dietary needs was impressive it was evident that she genuinely cared about our satisfaction and went above and beyond to ensure we had a memorable meal

throughout the evening bryannah remained attentive without being intrusive she always had a smile on her face and promptly attended to any requests or questions we had her efficiency and professionalism were truly remarkable and it made the overall dining experience even more enjoyable

one piece of advice i would give to those considering dining at montanas is to visit midweek during our visit the restaurant was relatively quiet allowing bryannah to provide personalized attention to each table it was evident that the midweek atmosphere allowed the staff to focus more closely on their guests resulting in an even more delightful dining experience

in terms of the food montanas did not disappoint the menu offered a wide range of mouthwatering options and the quality of the dishes was superb from the succulent ribs to the perfectly cooked steaks every bite was a delight to the taste buds the portions were generous and the presentation was visually appealing

overall my experience at montanas was exceptional and much of that credit goes to bryannah for her exceptional service her friendly and caring nature coupled with her attention to detail truly elevated our dining experience i highly recommend visiting montanas and if you have the opportunity being served by bryannah just remember for the best experience try to visit midweek when the restaurant is less crowded you wont be disappointed",0.9986,Good

Island Spice Jerk House,Caribbean,"71 Algoma Street South, S2, Thunder Bay, ON P7B",ON,48.4344841,-89.2259064,5,"so i had delivered to myself the irie sample feast options were 4 meats rice  beans coleslaw  steamed vegetables 4 festivals roti 2 beef patties i chose curry chicken oxtail curry goat  jerk chicken i wanted the steamed fish because it was recommended online but i wasnt allowed next visit

curry chicken 8410 not sure if its the best ive had but extremely close no bones which i appreciated but that makes it not authentic

curry goat 8210 never had it would recommend it

oxtail 8510 had difficulty telling the difference between this and the curry goat embarrassingly so i called someone  jamaicans dont curry oxtail i was told so then i knew the difference it was my first time and it tastes like a fatties roast beef that melts off the bone i see the appeal

jerk chicken 7410 this score isnt reflected by the fact i didnt get steamed fish it was good but unspectacular spices didnt stsnd out and i tasted mostly pepper wasnt bad at all but was expecting more

steamed vegetables 7810 was surprised and i could probably eat them straight which is something i normally wouldnt say

coleslaw 710 meh nothing to write home about

beef patties 8810 i had a homemade one of these years back and wasnt into them but this was really good the meat was almost pasty but really good

festivals 8410 kind of like strips of bannocksasass with sugar but not sweat enough to be a donut was great for dipping

roti 8510 never had fresh roti but this was really good reminded me of a warm giant folded thicker tortilla great for dipping or eating straight

rice  beans 7910 most commented thing online and was good but i felt like i could make or have better wasnt something id seek out but im glad i had it

mango carrot juice 8110 its a brand lots of sugar in it but i dont think it good and would recommend

i actually havent finished all the food yet at the time of this review  but i felt the need to comment fast due to the sheer amount that i likely wont finish in one sitting",0.9971,Good

spicy chicken poutine was your everyday buffalo chicken poutine minus green onions but since this is harveys you can add yer own toppings so i added some jalapeno peppers and it was quite good albeit maybe a little mild in terms of spice compared to other places  good thing is the bowl was surprisingly big especially compared to other chains whose poutines are usually small

the sour candy slush was pretty good not too sour not too sweet and refreshing on a hot day  only gripe is that the pictures showed it as being blue which woulda been nice but it was this sickly shade of green instead didnt look too appetizing

turnover on the other hand is what turned this review from a three stars to a four it was really good  unlike mcdonalds generic commercial turnovers that are just squishy and taste of corn syrup harveys turnovers are nice and crispy coated in crushed candy and filled with nice simple baking cream  overall a nice wholesome treat

so if yer more of a fries enthusiast id defo recommend giving harveys new poutines a try  oh and get their limited birthday cake turnovers while supplies last you wont regret it",0.9952,Good

drink was served in super cute lucky cat jar but was super watered down tasted like leftover cold green tea  definitely less than a caps worth of alcohol  no mango taste whatsoever

the appetizers were very meh thai soup was more like a potage with little to no taste and edamame were so oily it was hard to pop them open drowned the soup in sriracha

the main dish was even worse  general tao from the gutters i switched rice for udon noodles and they was way too much and undercooked the sauce was tasteless barely any tangy or sweetness and was legit not thickened at all  just a gross soup to top it off one huge piece of frozen broccoli and three chicken pieces that tasted like flash fried frozen nuggets with 0 crispness  just mushy and gross

the only upside is they agreed to give me my drink for free after this terrible meal and still i will not be going back
