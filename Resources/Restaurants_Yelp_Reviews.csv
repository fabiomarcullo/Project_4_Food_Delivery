The Flying Pig,Canadian (New),"1168 Hamilton Street Unit 104 Vancouver, BC V6B 2S2 Canada",BC,49.275039,-123.1220383,4,"Busy place - strongly suggest a reservation. Great Happy Hour menu, good service. Fish was nicely prepared, and paella had lots of seafood in a very small portion."
The Flying Pig,Canadian (New),"1168 Hamilton Street Unit 104 Vancouver, BC V6B 2S2 Canada",BC,49.275039,-123.1220383,4,"I recommend Squid is the best part. I ordered garlic bread to eat with Mussel dish was nice. Only the Risotto not impress, can put more flavour/texture is not reached. Overall is great!"
The Flying Pig,Canadian (New),"1168 Hamilton Street Unit 104 Vancouver, BC V6B 2S2 Canada",BC,49.275039,-123.1220383,5,"I really enjoyed my lunch at this cozy little place in beautiful Yaletown, Vancouver today!
They have a great selection on their menu and their lunch prices are reasonable. What really stood out for me was their warm, attentive and professional service. From the beginning to the end. The host made us feel very welcome and our server took very good care of us the whole time. Due to the winter wonderland feel and all the snow I felt I need to start things off with a nice cup of coffee. I loved the coffee. It was JJ Bean and piping hot and served in a sparkling cup.....exactly the way I like it.

We had the Pulled Pork Sandwich and the Chicken cutlets.
I loved the pulled pork, juicy and well seasoned with a nice crisp fresh ceasar salad and a slice of gherkin with the meal which was a nice touch. I love gherkins!

I also tried the Chicken cutlet which was beautifully cooked. Tender with the batter seasoned just on point and the mash was a perfect pairing.
""I MEAN WHO DOESN'T LIKE GREAT MASH?!""

Next time I'm going for the muscles! ;)"
The Flying Pig,Canadian (New),"1168 Hamilton Street Unit 104 Vancouver, BC V6B 2S2 Canada",BC,49.275039,-123.1220383,5,"Ambiance is great with a great mixture of wood and metal, light and dark, hard and soft. To drink I had their homemade ginger beer which was tangy and a hint sweet. For dinner, I ordered the short rib with a side of the corn. Both were outstanding! The short rib was served with the bone marrow which was an interesting touch. I didn't care for the marrow alone, but when I added a little piece to the meat, it was a brilliant combination! The corn was superb too .... sweet, but spicy due to the jalapeños. Definitely fresh corn too because I had to pull a string from my teeth :-)  Would definitely recommend this place!

Check it out, Vancouver!"
The Flying Pig,Canadian (New),"1168 Hamilton Street Unit 104 Vancouver, BC V6B 2S2 Canada",BC,49.275039,-123.1220383,5,We went to the Flying Pig for dinner last night and were so impressed by the incredible food and service that we went again for dinner tonight. Whilst travelling through Canada for the past weeks this was most definitely the BEST meals we have had! The menu is outstanding and so is the quality of the food and drinks. Bailey was our server both nights and is an absolute delight. She was warm and genuine and has an excellent knowledge of the menu. Definitely a place we would highly recommend to everyone!
Kingyo,Japanese,"871 Denman Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2L9 Canada",BC,49.2906122,-123.1370947,5,"During my 5-day stay in Vancouver, I couldn't resist visiting the lovely Japanese restaurant not once, but twice. Its authentic flavors, serene ambiance, and impeccable service left an indelible mark. A fusion of traditional and contemporary elements made it a standout experience in Vancouver's vibrant culinary scene."
Kingyo,Japanese,"871 Denman Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2L9 Canada",BC,49.2906122,-123.1370947,5,"The restaurant caught our attention when we walked by the restaurant around 11:50am - people were lining up for the restaurant to open at noon. We were lucky to get the bar seating. It’s not a huge restaurant and some tables were reserved for customers who made advanced reservations. We ordered hot green tea, Stone-Grilled Beef Tongue, Beef Tenderloin Steak Bowl, Sizzling Stone Pork Kakuni Bowl, and all of them were delicious! Great meat quality and well prepared dishes. It’s a restaurant running by Japanese with great foods and services. I highly recommend this place with advanced reservation."
Kingyo,Japanese,"871 Denman Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2L9 Canada",BC,49.2906122,-123.1370947,1,"It was my first time visiting the Japanese restaurant Kingyo, the food was absolutely good, and the service was no problem. Only one thing they limited table time to just one hour, my friends and I just had a quick drink, quick eating. Everything kinda super rushes, like eating fast food."
Kingyo,Japanese,"871 Denman Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2L9 Canada",BC,49.2906122,-123.1370947,2,Was excited to come due to good reviews however was very disappointed. It is definitely overrated. The food is so so. Pictures look good but not the taste. We spent about $200 3 adults and 1 kid. dinner menu is diff then lunch. A lot of food are not available during dinner. I wouldn’t want to come back enough said.
Kingyo,Japanese,"871 Denman Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2L9 Canada",BC,49.2906122,-123.1370947,4,We ordered four items as shown in the photos. The salad is the best. The sashimi is the second. The ramen was not bad. Just that the beef was a bit chewy. The pressed salmon sushi wasn’t very good. Too much rice and the rice was not fresh. The place was packed. Fun environment.
Miku,Japanese,"200 Granville Street Suite 70 Vancouver, BC V6C 1S4 Canada",BC,49.2868259,-123.112583,5,"Wow... Wow... Wow... bite after bite was a sublime experience in what Japanese fine dining can be.  Miku is a five star experience that deserves your visit.

The modern restaurant is beautiful, clean, and perfectly maintained.  We recommend sitting on the patio where you can either people watch or gaze over the harbour.  Inside tables offer window views or a view of the open kitchen.  It's all beautiful and adds to the experience.

Service is professional, friendly, and gracious.  We followed our server's recommendations and that was the right choice.  A team of people keeps the meal moving along and provides explanations of what you are eating.

However, the food is the star here and that is how it should be.  The flavors are carefully paired here and you will want to give those flavors a chance to delight your palette.  This is NOT sushi to be dunked in soya sauce.  I think you will also be delighted by how their cocktails complement the food choices.

Put Miku on your ""special meal out"" list and make an evening of it.  This is one of Vancouver's dining gems and certainly the best Japanese cuisine I have eaten.  I think you will agree."
Miku,Japanese,"200 Granville Street Suite 70 Vancouver, BC V6C 1S4 Canada",BC,49.2868259,-123.112583,5,"It is the most elegant sushi I had. The fish melts in your mouth! What an amazing culinary experience!
The service was friendly and the Sake recommandation was spot on… not cheap, but since the meal was so refined it called for a lush and polished taste."
Miku,Japanese,"200 Granville Street Suite 70 Vancouver, BC V6C 1S4 Canada",BC,49.2868259,-123.112583,5,I came here with my parents. Had an amazing experience. Steak and sushi were so good!!! Desert was delicious. Recommend the green tea opera desert!!    Servers were so nice as well. 5 star worthy!!!
Miku,Japanese,"200 Granville Street Suite 70 Vancouver, BC V6C 1S4 Canada",BC,49.2868259,-123.112583,4,"Super awesome restaurant with really great staff. We ordered the tasting menu and it was amazing, but maybe one course too long. It was a lot of very delicious food but after the 4th course it just became a lot, and we didn’t end up eating some of the dishes because we were so full. The atmosphere in the restaurant is amazing and the fish artwork on the wall is beautiful. Super great cocktails and wine list."
Miku,Japanese,"200 Granville Street Suite 70 Vancouver, BC V6C 1S4 Canada",BC,49.2868259,-123.112583,3,"Upon entering the restaurant for a evening dinner date, it was quite spacious and I saw a sign that the restaurant was one of the nominees for a Michelin star. The lighting in the room isn't very flattering if you take pictures of your group but at least the food had decent lighting. The server we had was friendly and knowledgeable about recommendations. We ended up getting the platter, sashimi, salad, and brussel sprout appetizer to share between 2 people. When the food arrived, the portion size was really small but it was to be expected of a upscale restaurant.  The taste was fresh but I felt like other Japanese restaurants I've tried were above in quality and taste so it was really nothing special that jumped out at me. Perhaps only the sashimi presentation was unique with the cool ice mist. I guess I should've ordered more because I was left feeling hungry still but my date had a budget and I didn't want to scare him away with my huge appetite. Next time I'd like to try the lunch menu instead."
Kosoo,Korean,"1128 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1B2 Canada",BC,49.2849885,-123.1259586,5,"The restaurant is known for its authentic Korean cuisine, which is prepared with the freshest ingredients and cooked to perfection. The dishes are bursting with flavor and have a unique blend of spices that will tantalize your taste buds. From traditional Korean BBQ to savory stews and soups, there is something for everyone on the menu.

In addition to the delicious food, the service at Kosoo is excellent. The staff is friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu, providing an exceptional dining experience for guests. However, as the restaurant is quite popular, it is recommended to make a reservation in advance to avoid any disappointment.

Overall, Kosoo Korean restaurant is an excellent choice for those who love Korean cuisine and are looking for a high-quality dining experience. The food is exceptional, the service is top-notch, and the atmosphere is lively and enjoyable. It's a must-try for anyone visiting Vancouver, Canada."
Kosoo,Korean,"1128 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1B2 Canada",BC,49.2849885,-123.1259586,5,"We had the beef brisket skillet, and it was absolutely amazing, made many lettuce wraps and enjoyed it with rice.
It was all delicious and there's little room for improvement because it was pretty much perfect!
Would go again and would highly recommend this place."
Kosoo,Korean,"1128 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1B2 Canada",BC,49.2849885,-123.1259586,5,"Had a great experience here, the beef brisket skillet was amazing, fried chicken was crispy and crunchy, yet sauced and flavourful, the miso soup was refreshing, and the beef gimbap was great value.
Rose tteokbokki was good, subtle flavour with a lot of cheese.
Improvements I'd suggest would be how the fried chicken shell was a little thick, sides could've been presented in bigger dishes for less refills, and the gimbap didn't taste the most fresh, though it was still good."
Kosoo,Korean,"1128 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1B2 Canada",BC,49.2849885,-123.1259586,5,"Excellent experience we had here at this restaurant.  Tasty food and good portion size.  Service was quite decent as well.  We especially appreciated the taste of Korean style sausage.  Also the broth of army stew was rich.  Parking is available behind the building for $3 an hour.  We will return soon to try their other dishes.  Overall, this is a pretty nice Korean restaurant to try if you are in the area."
Kosoo,Korean,"1128 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1B2 Canada",BC,49.2849885,-123.1259586,5,"First off, I have to say that the fried chicken at Kosoo is absolutely delicious. The batter is perfectly crispy and crunchy, while the meat inside remains tender and juicy. They offer a variety of flavors, including original, soy garlic, spicy, and honey butter, so there's something for everyone. I particularly enjoyed the soy garlic flavor, which had just the right amount of sweetness and savory garlic flavor.

In addition to the fried chicken, Kosoo also offers a variety of other Korean dishes that are equally delicious. The bibimbap is a standout, with a flavorful mix of rice, vegetables, and protein that is sure to satisfy. The side dishes, such as the kimchi and pickled radish, are also great.

The service at Kosoo is friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is casual and cozy. The restaurant is relatively small, so it can get quite busy during peak hours, but the wait is usually not too long.

Overall, I highly recommend Kosoo for anyone looking for delicious Korean fried chicken and other Korean dishes in Vancouver. The food is top-notch, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is welcoming."

I loved this place. We may have ordered a bit too much food, but we really wanted to get a good spread of the menu. I had come in once years ago and can confirm it was just as good as I remember it.

I’d recommend coming in with friends if possible, as the dining can accommodate it easily and it’s best to get a variety of meals. I’d say 1.5 orders per person is probably the ratio to go with. Anything more, and you might be bussin out of your pants.

I’d recommend to check it out"
Dinesty Dumpling House,Chinese,"1719 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 1C8 Canada",BC,49.2907799,-123.1340727,4,Average taste but they give small portions. The soup dumplings are the smallest I have seen. Excellent friendly service.
Dinesty Dumpling House,Chinese,"1719 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 1C8 Canada",BC,49.2907799,-123.1340727,5,More than a dumpling restaurant. Everything I ordered taste great. Definitely will come back.
Dinesty Dumpling House,Chinese,"1719 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 1C8 Canada",BC,49.2907799,-123.1340727,4,"We had rolls, dumplings, xiao long baos, fried rice and some rice rolls, which was fantastic.

Though I dont recommend shiumai  in particular, the food was amazing.

Be mindful there is an intermission at 2:30, where you’re not allowed to br inside the restaurant.

I would still come again since I respect the house rule and like the food."
Dinesty Dumpling House,Chinese,"1719 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 1C8 Canada",BC,49.2907799,-123.1340727,5,There's a reason why it's packed and there's a line up outside! My first time and I went because I read out their Soup Dumplings being the best in the city. To my surprise it wasn't actual soup with Dumplings in it haha but actual Dumplings filled with soup. They were so good and why they are listed as #1 in Canada. I also had the wonton in hot and sour sauce and my stomach was very happy..and warm! Just go to this place. Everyone around you is just taken back by how fast the service is but more so how amazing the food is!!
Saku,Japanese,"1588 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2G5 Canada",BC,49.2892453,-123.1323169,5,"The pork, chicken, shrimp katsu is very juicy and tender on the inside. The outside is crunchy and not oily. The sauce is great but sprinkling salt and sesame seems to bring out meat taste more. Do not recommend the white fish as it was slightly soggy at the bottom and the fish was quite tough in the middle. Other white fish I had before is very fluffy and light with a gentle sweetness to it. This one was briny only.

Presentation of the food is great. Seating is wonderfully spacious. Service is quite attentive and friendly.

All in all it was a very pleasant experience. Slightly on the expensive side."
Saku,Japanese,"1588 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2G5 Canada",BC,49.2892453,-123.1323169,5,"Decided to come here for a late lunch, but even then, the place is still packed. Very popular and I could see why. We got the Zenbu set and it was a lot of food for 2 people. It was so good though. Esp the fatty pork and scallop. Also have to mention the salad. Seems very simple but the dressing is amazing. Service was just fine but the atmosphere was really nice. Will come back for sure."
Saku,Japanese,"1588 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2G5 Canada",BC,49.2892453,-123.1323169,5,"I am absolutely smitten with the culinary delights offered at this remarkable Japanese restaurant. However, what truly sets it apart is the exceptional team of individuals who work here. The waitstaff exhibited unmatched friendliness, going above and beyond by attentively checking on my friend and me throughout the dining experience. Their genuine care and attentiveness truly left a lasting impression. Kudos to this establishment for fostering such a warm and caring environment!"
Saku,Japanese,"1588 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2G5 Canada",BC,49.2892453,-123.1323169,5,"Very pleasant and friendly.  Food was fantastic. The chicken breast was prepared very well, hot and tasted fresh.    The soft drink was a bit of novelty but tasted good (strawberry).   The waiter we had was always smiling and very pleasant.  The place was quite as most patrons despite the place being full most of our visit spoke in low voices."
Saku,Japanese,"1588 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2G5 Canada",BC,49.2892453,-123.1323169,5,"Nice little quaint place. Staff were super friendly and service was fast. Free refills on the salad , rice, and soup though we didn’t need it. Our water was always refilled and they did such a tremendous job while we dined there. Katsu was so juicy and tender! I love how they have the gravy baits too. I’d highly recommend."
Saku,Japanese,"548 W Broadway Vancouver, BC V5Z 1E9 Canada",BC,49.2631006,-123.1166394,4,"The food here is amazing however the Broadway location is not equipped for large parties. We had 9 people and was told we would be able to sit together but on separate tables. Unfortunately the tables were really far apart and those on the ends of the table could not talk to each other until after dinner. Aside from that, our dinner itself was good. I ordered the cheese Katsu with a side of curry to share with my husband. Miso soup and salad is refillable and we ordered it twice. Add the curry, you won't regret it :)"
Saku,Japanese,"548 W Broadway Vancouver, BC V5Z 1E9 Canada",BC,49.2631006,-123.1166394,5,I really enjoyed my meal here. Everything part of the dish was very delicious and so intricate with detail. Simple but tasty. Friendly servers. Price point was on the higher side for the full meals but the taste and portion is well worth the total at the end. You can get unlimited sides too I believe.
Saku,Japanese,"548 W Broadway Vancouver, BC V5Z 1E9 Canada",BC,49.2631006,-123.1166394,5,"Saku is certainly worth trying! We ordered the chicken breast katsu with curry and the regular chicken breast katsu - both were great and the service is top notch. The curry was unique and they provide a generous amount which you can share with your party. The side salad and miso soup were perfect additions to the deep fried main dishes, and they’re also unlimited which was nice. The staff are super friendly and the prices seemed fair given the portions."
Saku,Japanese,"548 W Broadway Vancouver, BC V5Z 1E9 Canada",BC,49.2631006,-123.1166394,5,"I've been to Saku Broadway and Saku Robson, and both restaurants are a 10/10 for me. The cheese katsu is immaculate, and it comes with all these little extras like soup, salad, flavoured salt, mustard. The extras are u limited too! So if you want more soup or salad just ask for it! 😋 The salad dressing they have is delicious too. 🥗

The servers at the Broadway location were incredibly helpful they would come by our table every 5-10 minutes to ask if we wanted more food or to refill our water. 💧

The price is quite expensive but that's the price of living in Vancouver these days. You do get a good amount of food for the price you're paying. 👍"
Saku,Japanese,"548 W Broadway Vancouver, BC V5Z 1E9 Canada",BC,49.2631006,-123.1166394,4,First time trying Nabe Katau at Saku. I prefer the regular (Rosu/Hire) katsu more than this soup-y dish. Anyway it’s good for my throat when I needed something warm and not oily.
Guu with Garlic,Japanese,"1698 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 1C7 Canada",BC,49.2901752,-123.1340034,4,"Went here on for a Saturday lunch and it wasn’t super busy. The ambiance was quiet and cozy. As for food, we got a few dishes to share. The tuna tataki was a bit of a letdown as it didn’t taste fresh. But pleasantly surprised by the beef tendon curry."
Guu with Garlic,Japanese,"1698 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 1C7 Canada",BC,49.2901752,-123.1340034,5,"Always an amazing time here. Been coming here for over a decade. Super to see them survive this long and still going strong. Great good, staff, service, food and drinks. What more do you want. Always fun and energetic ambience. Always busy too. Like I said, been coming here for a long time and I plan to keep coming back. Highly recommend"
Guu with Garlic,Japanese,"1698 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 1C7 Canada",BC,49.2901752,-123.1340034,4,"Came here for some tapas before we went to the beach. Service was quick & friendly, and the food was fast & delicious! We ordered a few things here we haven’t tried before and a couple of our usuals. The grilled pork cheek was my favourite. Presentation could be a little better & the seats outside were a bit dirty (grease from what I assume to be previous customers were not wiped off) but it’s an Izakaya so not a ton of marks taken off there."
Guu with Garlic,Japanese,"1698 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 1C7 Canada",BC,49.2901752,-123.1340034,5,"An authentic slice of the Rising Sun in British Columbia, Guu with Garlic is located in downtown Vancouver B.C. at the north end of trendy Robson Street. Walk inside and immediately feel like you're in a Tokyo neighborhood restaurant. Hungry for sushi? Look elsewhere. This place serves authentic Izakaya style small plate cooked delights like Takoyaki, Yaki-Udon, Kara-age chicken, Tuna Tataki, etc. High quality ingredients, friendly, patient, professional & helpful service; highly recommended! Support your local small businesses & restaurants 👍 😋"
Guu with Garlic,Japanese,"1698 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 1C7 Canada",BC,49.2901752,-123.1340034,4,"Small establishment. It was quite busy so my friend and I sat at the corner of the “bar” next to the wall. It was a bit of a squeeze. Thankfully they have hangers on the wall behind to hang coats. Could be a hassle going in and out depending where you are sitting because everyone will have to get up. Anyway, EVERY item ordered was delicious! Started off with the Assorted Oden w/ Soup. It was quite cold outside so I found it quite comforting and the soup was light. I had never had boiled daikon before. It was quite delicious. I wasn’t too crazy about the hard boiled egg though. It was over cooked because the yolk was green and very dry. I thought the Kimchi Cucumber was going to be red and spicy. But not at all. Perhaps I’m ignorant to the fact that not all kimchi means spicy? It was ok. Mildly sweet and sour. The Kakuni Stewed Pork Belly was absolutely amazing. The meat was so tender and came with another boiled/stewed daikon which I ate to myself 😅 The poached egg was good. The soy sauce gave it a nice flavor. As for the Assorted 5Kinds sashimi plate, I really enjoyed the Yellowtail. The scallops were good also. Actually tasted the sweetness and I’m no sushi connoisseur. The Carbonara Udon was interesting. I have never had carbonara before but I did enjoy it with udon noodles. It just tasted like a creamy sauce over udon noodles. I didn’t get a chance to try it before the egg was mixed in. I enjoyed it nonetheless. The final dish, Pan Fried Pork Intestines. I really enjoyed this dish and so did my friend. She ate 3/4 of the plate to herself!! It would have been nice if we had rice. This dish I highly recommend! I found out that each Guu has their own specialty which I thought was interesting. I would love to come back to this one for the other menu items before going to the other locations. I highly recommend this place. Probably not good for large parties though."
Fable Kitchen,Canadian (New),"1944 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 1M5 Canada",BC,49.2679331,-123.1490013,4,"Food here was pretty delicious for the most part, I really liked the beet tartare and the gnocchi with pork belly. My boyfriend ordered the medium rare duck and it had an interesting flavor. Drinks were pretty good too, we ordered a st.patricks day sour with charcoal which was really tasty. Also our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu, really great service here! This restaurant is a bit on the expensive side though"
Fable Kitchen,Canadian (New),"1944 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 1M5 Canada",BC,49.2679331,-123.1490013,5,"Try the house-made mocktails! Best I've had - ""No-groni"" was complex, aromatic, and refreshing. The pineapple-gin-spritz was flavorful, not sweet, with a peppery finish.
The Butcher's cut was already beautifully seasoned with herbs that really enhanced the flavor, but then the ""pepper jam"" ginger reduction was absolutely to die for - rich, sticky flavor explosions with every mouthful. The bok choy greens and miso potatoes were the perfect accompaniment. Both desserts were wonderful - rhubarb with strawberry curd in blueberry-balsamic ice cream melded amazing flavors together under a toasted meringue top, while the bittersweet chocolate orange with graham cake was a satisfying and rich blend without being heavy or too sweet."
Fable Kitchen,Canadian (New),"1944 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 1M5 Canada",BC,49.2679331,-123.1490013,5,"This is an acclaimed restaurant located in the Kitsilano area, has been awarded the prestigious Michelin Bib Gourmand.

Loved watching the live kitchen do their thing while eating my breakfast. They were kind enough to cater substitutes for my dairy allergy. Streak bacon was delish, highly recommend it with your eggs. As someone who never ate yolks (raw or runny) and always loved it mixed in (scrambled/cooked in/over hard), I have no remorse for all you patrons who enjoy Bennies. They did however look extremely appetizing."
Fable Kitchen,Canadian (New),"1944 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 1M5 Canada",BC,49.2679331,-123.1490013,3,"Brunch time on a Saturday is really busy in Kitsilano so it was good that we made a reservation in advance. Food was good, I loved my dish which was one of the daily features, don't remember the name but it had hash potatoes with mushroom, chorizo sausage, Swiss cheese, 2 poached eggs and bread. Prices go with the market. Service left behind my expectations, the server was not taking notes of the orders and like we were imagining she forgot some items. Not a bad experience but for sure not a remarkable one."
Fanny Bay Oyster Bar & Shellfish Market,Seafood,"762 Cambie St Vancouver, BC V6B 2P2 Canada",BC,49.2786079,-123.1141059,4,"A few years back, I had a truly enjoyable lunch at Fanny Bay Oyster Bar & Shellfish Market. The oysters were the highlight, remarkably fresh and reasonably priced. The staff were helpful and friendly, making the entire dining experience even better. Overall, it was a great meal that left a lasting impression. I'd recommend Fanny Bay to anyone looking for quality oysters on a budget."
Fanny Bay Oyster Bar & Shellfish Market,Seafood,"762 Cambie St Vancouver, BC V6B 2P2 Canada",BC,49.2786079,-123.1141059,5,After checking online for the best seafood we found the reviews of this place good. But when we reached there & had one of the BEST SEAFOOD we will definitely go there again. Service is great Shana was a gem of a person with whom we talked long & her friend guided us through what to choose & have. White wine was great worth every penny. As a tourist we want food which will touch our heart & carry sweet memories back… this was one of it.

I was welcomed immediately and straightforward to my seat at the bar. Then came the oyster education. Awesome. I had three minutes until happy hour was up. The server generously said that I shouldn’t worry, they would have my order in within the happiest of hours.

Delicious, fresh, ocean fragrant oysters!

Get the fish tacos. Best anywhere.

Be here for happy hour. It’s the best in the city. Just make sure you’re here before three minutes to six!!! I simply had to order a second round."
Fanny Bay Oyster Bar & Shellfish Market,Seafood,"762 Cambie St Vancouver, BC V6B 2P2 Canada",BC,49.2786079,-123.1141059,5,"This place- 5 stars all around. Amazing food. Period. But even better is the staff. Andrew and Adanary are among the top people I've ever encountered at a restaurant anywhere on earth. The seafood is fresh, and they literally sell live prawns. Oysters are a must here and happy hour is a steal. Sit at the bar and meet the local crew. Seldom do I find a place where I am greeted and treated as family. Pro tip to the owner- you've hired amazingly."
Fanny Bay Oyster Bar & Shellfish Market,Seafood,"762 Cambie St Vancouver, BC V6B 2P2 Canada",BC,49.2786079,-123.1141059,5,"A hidden gem. Have driven by this location quite often and had no idea what was behind this unassuming exterior. Nice modern interior, excellent friendly staff. We came here for the dine-out experience and had a delicious meal. Each of the appetizer, main, and desert selections was very tasty. The seafood was fresh, the oysters had a nice fresh taste, even the lettuce was fresh and crisp which is more difficult during January. Also a big surprise was the size of each portion. Usually during the dine-out events, the serving portions are more like for a tasting menu. The portions they served were large, probably their normal serving size. So a very good meal at an excellent value."
Sula,Indian,"4172 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3P7 Canada",BC,49.2479632,-123.1007692,5,Had a wonderful meal last night at this restaurant. Their menu was very extensive. We ordered a few familiar items and they were amazing. Everything was perfectly seasoned. Service was good and we didn’t feel rushed on a Saturday night.
Sula,Indian,"4172 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3P7 Canada",BC,49.2479632,-123.1007692,5,"Ordered 2 starters, one curry, garlic naan and a side rice and everything exceeded my expectations. Although the atmosphere inside was really nice, we opted to sit on the street patio and loved it. The servers were very attentive and all the food was so fresh and flavourful! 11/10 recommend, will definitely be back!"
Sula,Indian,"4172 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3P7 Canada",BC,49.2479632,-123.1007692,4,We decided to order from Sula on Main.  The food was delicious.  Garlic and potato naan picked up the sauces well.   The lamb and chicken were tender and the spicy level good.  Food arrived hot.  Highly recommend!
Sula,Indian,"4172 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3P7 Canada",BC,49.2479632,-123.1007692,5,"First time dining at Sula on Main Street with my family. We had family visiting from California with us. They wanted to have Indian food on their last night in Vancouver, so we took them here.
I'm so glad Sula was able to accommodate a last minute reservation for 7 people.

The food is amazing! We had Tandoori Wings, Vegetable Pakoras, and Paneer Fingers as appetizers. We shared 2 pitchers of Rose Sangria.

We had Lamb Korma, Chicken Biryani, Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, Saag Paneer and Coconut Rice for our main dishes.

For dessert, we ordered Gulab Jamun and the Ras Malai Cake.

Everything was presented beautifully. The food tasted  fantastic! Everything was perfectly seasoned and spiced.  The curries were rich and creamy.

Oh and that Garlic Cheese Naan is divine! We actually ordered more of that to go.

Our relatives were so impressed. They said the food they had at Sula was better than the Indian food  they had in California.

We sat out on their covered patio which was very nice and comfortable. The interior of the restaurant is lovely too.

The service was very good and attentive.
I'll definitely be back.

I highly recommend this restaurant!"
Sula,Indian,"4172 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3P7 Canada",BC,49.2479632,-123.1007692,2,"Food was pretty good, however the service was disappointing.
Took 20 minutes for a waits-person to approach our table, another 30 minutes for the food, no one checked up on us for the next 30 minutes eventhough we wanted to order more stuff.
We were initially offered a plate with a bug on it, which grossed me out and isnt acceptable as we were one of the only 2 tables of customers in the store ( would have been ok if it was busy, but it wasnt)
Took over 10 minutes for catch the attention of someone to get new plates. They replaced the plates & offered no apology.

Overall, the foods good but it isnt worth the waiting and the lack of service.

We've previously ordered through online platforms, but the food arrived bland and messy , however, in in-person dining, the food tasted good. Would probably recommend one of their other locations over this one."
Phnom Penh,Cambodian,"244 E Georgia Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1Z7 Canada",BC,49.2783112,-123.0981943,5,"Visited about 3 weeks ago on vacation with family. Service was great, we didn't make a reservation but probably should have. The hostess was very helpful, seated us when the table was ready, helped take our orders and helped us decide what to order when we were torn between a few items. The food came out quickly and everything was delicious. The pork chops were flavorful, fried chicken wings were really good, and the rest of the food did not disappoint!"
Phnom Penh,Cambodian,"244 E Georgia Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1Z7 Canada",BC,49.2783112,-123.0981943,5,"Always amazing food at Phnom Penh! The chicken wings are to die for, it's a MUST when you come here to eat. I usually get a large order of wings for each person. That's how good these are.

The butter beef is another must order here. It's so good on its own.

Beef Luc Lac is another must try dish here. You can order it with white rice. This time I tried it with fried rice and it's seriously delicious. Fried rice, with fried egg on top. You have to have to try it.

I think everyone knows by now that this place is a must try, whether you're a foodie or not. I've been coming here for years and they never disappoint!

Food is always amazing, service is always great, and this time we didn't even have to line up to get a table, which is a huge bonus!!"
Phnom Penh,Cambodian,"244 E Georgia Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1Z7 Canada",BC,49.2783112,-123.0981943,4,"We got in at 11am when it’s open. The restaurant is filled quickly within the first 15 minutes. Food quality is a lot better than takeout - the deep fried chicken wings with lemon butter sauce can retain the crispness. The lemongrass pork tastes great and the combination C offers a variety of choices. Overall, very good food and will visit again.
Warning - I feel very thirsty the afternoon after dining there. They might have used MSG in their food."
Phnom Penh,Cambodian,"244 E Georgia Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1Z7 Canada",BC,49.2783112,-123.0981943,5,"A friend took us here to this restaurant when we visited Vancouver and it was quite the treat. The food was excellent all around and my whole family really enjoyed the durian milkshake. The chicken wings were my favourite. They also had a few stir fried options for the vegetarians as well (lotus stems, snow pea tips, etc...)"
Phnom Penh,Cambodian,"244 E Georgia Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1Z7 Canada",BC,49.2783112,-123.0981943,5,"All the good was perfect, no complaints here. Went with mostly all the house favourites. And tried some of the other items. Definitely recommend try the
-Beef butter marinate(sweet soy sauce with onions, ginger, a lot of cilantro/parsley)
-Phnom Pheh pho was also good
-Deep fried chicken wings. A nice sweet and crispy but also came with a good size portion of lemon pepper sauce to dip your wings in."

Antoine was a fantastic server, he was very knowledgeable and attentive at the right times. He answered all our questions and helped us choose oysters too. Best service I have ever experienced. Food was very delicious too!"
Blue Water Cafe,Seafood,"1095 Hamilton St Vancouver, BC V6B 5T4 Canada",BC,49.2762194,-123.1211296,5,"Went for dinner last night and was absolutely blown away by the service. While the food was amazing, the service was incomparable! My friends and I had the pleasure of dining with Tara and her colleagues and this was by far my best dining experience in the city (and I'm a local)!

Tara was knowledgeable, attentive and just a pleasure to be around. From the moment we arrived we were warmly greeted and never once did we have to try and seek her attention as she was always checking in. Any time someone left the table, her and her team were quick ensure settings and napkins remained tidy and presentable upon our arrival back. Tara explained the menu in detail and was quick to recommend food and beverage pairings that we were all pleased with. The food was beautifully presented, tasted great and everyone was satisfied.

While I don't have photos of everything we ordered, the raw oysters were fresh and sweet, prawns were plump and juicy, and sashimi was fresh and paired with an in house soy sauce. I ordered the beef tenderloin and asked for it to be cooked between medium rare and rare and it was cooked to perfection. It was tender, seared crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. I also ordered the truffle fries as a side and will say you have to try them!

Tara is a gem and I want to thank her and the staff for creating such a welcoming atmosphere that was paired with amazing food! I don't know how it took me so long to come here but can definitely say I will be back.

Make your reservation now and thank me later!"
Blue Water Cafe,Seafood,"1095 Hamilton St Vancouver, BC V6B 5T4 Canada",BC,49.2762194,-123.1211296,3,"The best thing about this restaurant is the ambiance and the service: lights dimmed to focus on the people you are eating with. As for food, my mixed ceviche was tender but needed a little bit more of lime, you could tell the quality of the sea food was excellent but needed more acid to make it more interesting. My chicken, with potatoes, was a bit undercooked and under seasoned, it also needed to build more flavour. Overall, it was a good enough experience."
Blue Water Cafe,Seafood,"1095 Hamilton St Vancouver, BC V6B 5T4 Canada",BC,49.2762194,-123.1211296,5,"A delicious dinner with excellent service from Liam. A great place to celebrate my wife’s birthday. The seafood plateau was a tasty appetizer sized just right for 2 people. Just love the special fork they have to aid diners with the assorted oysters, mussels, clams, and other tasty treats. The halibut was firm and juicy, and although the steak was medium rather than the medium-rare we requested, it was still juicy and very tasty. We didn’t leave much room for desert, so settled for tasty strawberry & raspberry lemon tarts. Highly recommended for a memorable night out."
Blue Water Cafe,Seafood,"1095 Hamilton St Vancouver, BC V6B 5T4 Canada",BC,49.2762194,-123.1211296,5,"Everything was phenomenal, but the sablefish was impeccable - the best fish we’ve ever tasted. It was cooked beautifully. In the past,the scallops and those are magnificent as well. I’m addition to the food, the service is professional and kind - we’re always well taken care of. I rarely give out five stars but this place never fails to impress us."
Anh and Chi,Vietnamese,"3388 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3M7 Canada",BC,49.2550532,-123.1008858,5,"A very unique and modern take on Vietnamese cuisine! The interior decor and outdoor patio are both really nicely decorated. Definitely feels different from the run of the mill pho joint. There's an expansive menu of different Vietnamese dishes. The items I tried were the shaken beef dish and the beef short rib rice, both of which were super tasty and had amazing presentation. Portions are decent and pricing is slightly higher, but that's to be expected given the quality and refined ambiance. Their mixed drinks were also tasty. Service was friendly and attentive. Would definitely come back to try their other dishes"
Anh and Chi,Vietnamese,"3388 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3M7 Canada",BC,49.2550532,-123.1008858,4,"First time coming here,didn't book a table in advance to my demise. Staff are very friendly, great service all around. Waiter was very helpful with his recommendations. Starter was delicious and very well presented the prawn cakes. I risked it going for the spicy beef soup which was tasty and lots of meat/broth and my partner got the deconstructed vermicelli noodles which were very tasty and again, big portion!  Will go back again as vibe in there was cool and food is worth trying."
Anh and Chi,Vietnamese,"3388 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3M7 Canada",BC,49.2550532,-123.1008858,5,"Love the Vietnamese vibe here. The servers are energetic and friendly. The mango salad and Fresh Saigon Roll are so refreshing . Perfect choices during summer! The wok fried noodles and number 37 are highly recommended as well. The skin of the lemon chicken is crispy but not oily. All the sauce perfectly matches with the main dishes. However, the portion of each dish is not large. Those with big appetite may have to order more."
Anh and Chi,Vietnamese,"3388 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3M7 Canada",BC,49.2550532,-123.1008858,4,I love their covered patio setup. It was nice to get some sun while eating even though it was cold outside. Food was good! I enjoyed everything we ordered. Our server was new so the service was a little slow. We had to wave her down multiple times… but understandable.
Anh and Chi,Vietnamese,"3388 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3M7 Canada",BC,49.2550532,-123.1008858,5,"Anh and Chi was an excellent experience, we did have to wait for about 20 minutes but it wasn't a big deal as we just purused down the street and admired all the other exciting looking restaurants for next time.
We ordered crispy spring rolls, amazing, crispy prawn cakes, delicious, and chicken wings, fabulous. The wings especially were nicely cooked, crispy exterior and moist and tender inside. The sauce was excellent. They all exceeded expectations and were full of flavor without being too greasy and heavy. We ordered the curry with a side of rice, which was excellent, and the Pho Hoang, a recipe from the original establishment that has been around for almost 40 years - and you can see why. The flavor was just wonderful. We also had the beef and watercress salad - the only thing I have to say could be improved is the salad was maybe a bit dry, you definitely need to eat the vegetables with portions of meat in each bite otherwise it's just not soft or wet enough. More dressing, or a soft vegetable, something, was missing. The service was good, although we did get better service from a waitress who wasn't actually assigned to our table. Our own waitress seemed a bit bored, but she was still polite, attentive, and answered all of our questions.
I would absolutely recommend this restaurant and if visiting Vancouver would come again. Loved, loved it!"

As there were so many amazing options on the menu we decided to go with A La Carte in order to try more of the menu since we are from out of town.

Everything tasted amazing and they even split some of the dishes for us in order to make it easier to eat. I could recommend everything that we ate. Drinks also did not disappoint, very tasty and unique.

I think this was my favourite restaurant of this trip and we went to quick a few nice restaurant (including a Michelin star restaurant). Highly recommend it if you are able to try it.

Street parking is reasonable, plan for 3 hours though."

It is certainly a pricy experience but, we would do again for sure. You won't regret.

However rating it in comparison with other restaurants I have been to would put it in the middle of the pack. I actually just added one more star for atmosphere, due to the fact that you can clearly see the kitchen. It is quite entertaining to watch the head chef and his minions crafting the dishes."
Botanist,Canadian (New),"1038 Canada Place Vancouver, BC V6C 0B9 Canada",BC,49.2880551,-123.1163832,5,"An exquisite dining experience! Came in for brunch with no reservation. Luckily, after a 10-minute wait, someone canceled.
Service was brilliant, food and drinks tasted delicious, and the vegan dessert was amazing!
The brunch was under $90 with tips included. Fantastic spot for a date. Highly recommend reservations!
I will be back 100% thank you!"
Botanist,Canadian (New),"1038 Canada Place Vancouver, BC V6C 0B9 Canada",BC,49.2880551,-123.1163832,5,"A staple of upscale dining in Vancouver. The cocktails are some of the best in the city that is awarding winning.

Top notch service.

The food can be a bit of a hit and miss as it changes quite a bit with the season. The 3 dishes we had were tasty, but just not memorable that leaves you wanting more. The octopus was a bit on the chewy side and the scallop was buried under all the sauce that took away from the delicate textures and flavour of the sea. The salad was my favourite of the night as it had a great textures from the bee pollen and acid from the dressing."
Forage,Canadian (New),"1300 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1C5 Canada",BC,49.2870362,-123.1290585,5,"My friend and I shared the salmon Benedict and the French toast. It was incredible! And the prices are super reasonable too.
Big shout out to our server and the staff here. We got asked if we wanted more coffee every 15 mins and felt like the staff really knew what they were doing. 100/10 will come back here when I'm back in Vancouver."
Forage,Canadian (New),"1300 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1C5 Canada",BC,49.2870362,-123.1290585,5,"Spent a few days at the Listel Hotel and Forage was recommended to me by several folks. The restaurant has a nice modern feel, the staff were welcoming and helpful in their recommendations. If you are into locally sourced and sustainable foods, Forage might be up your alley! I should also mention…. Their sourdough pan bread is an absolute treat and definitely a must if you visit (it’s great as an appetizer or dessert!)."
Forage,Canadian (New),"1300 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1C5 Canada",BC,49.2870362,-123.1290585,5,"Had a great Easter brunch with the family.  Was able to get a reservation for 6 without issue (we did book a week in advance). Due to the holiday they did request we be done in 75 minutes for the next party.

Great drinks and food. I had the whiskey latte and the pork belly Benedict. Highly recommend. Family also had the pancakes, which they loved as well."
Forage,Canadian (New),"1300 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1C5 Canada",BC,49.2870362,-123.1290585,4,"We got the mushrooms entree, bison steak, and cast iron bread. The mushrooms were ok. The cast iron bread was very very very oily so I only ate one piece. The major + was the bison which was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious."
Forage,Canadian (New),"1300 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1C5 Canada",BC,49.2870362,-123.1290585,3,"Overall, I think the food is nice and above average, but I expected more given the prices charged and the fame of this restaurant.

For starters, the seared tuna and oysters were freshly served. But I think there were too much tuna paste on the tuna which overtook the freshness of the seafood. The miso itself was too rich and my tongue got carried away.

For main, I ordered the grilled octopus and pork chop. Again, the use of miso paste in both dishes were too significant and I found the flavour too repetitive. The pork chop, in particular, was drowned in different sauces. I wasn’t too sure what the chef was trying to present.

Knowing the chef-in-charged is a Chinese, I was hoping to see some Chinese cooking method / elements in the dishes. Unfortunately, there weren’t any…"
Twisted Fork,French,"213 Carral Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2J2 Canada",BC,49.2831834,-123.1044482,5,Some of the most delicious brunch food I've had while eating out. I was especially impressed that they make in-house gluten-free toast that can be subbed with most of their dishes (minus the French toast and one other item). Their French press coffee is also delicious and generously portioned. I would definitely come here again to try their egg bennies or something else.
Twisted Fork,French,"213 Carral Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2J2 Canada",BC,49.2831834,-123.1044482,5,"My group came here for lunch on a Friday around 1pm and were able to be seated right away.

Right away, I was captivated by the unique decor. They had standing mixers filled with plants as centerpieces. That was super neat.

The staff was really friendly and also gave us some great recommendations for things to do in Vancouver.

My only complaint was the menu felt a bit limited. They serve brunch for most of the afternoon and then switch to dinner at 5 I believe. I wish there were some more dishes on the menu that didn’t include eggs.

I did order the fruit salad and scones. It was honestly the best fruit salad I’ve ever had. I would order it again.

This is definitely a great choice for breakfast/brunch!"
Twisted Fork,French,"213 Carral Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2J2 Canada",BC,49.2831834,-123.1044482,5,"One of the best brunches I’ve had! We got lucky and didn’t have to wait more than 10min for a spot at the counter. All the staff were friendly and attentive. Most importantly, the food was so good (we got the croque monsieur and French toast)! Loved the attention to detail with the menu and how they made elevated versions of classic dishes. Very reasonably priced for the quality, location and service that you receive and a great place to bring a date"
Twisted Fork,French,"213 Carral Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2J2 Canada",BC,49.2831834,-123.1044482,4,"Uniquely designed brunch recipes are amazing in taste. Both sweet & savoury options are available. Menu is not so vast but serves the purpose of a brunch restaurant. Both alcoholic & non alcoholic drinks are available but in coffee only French press option is available.
Atmosphere of this place is unmatchable. Most desiring location under the sun and in the city’s most happening area. There is indoor seating as well. Staff is great too.
We ordered French toast which was definitely a big portion served with some fruits n maple syrup but so delicious. Our other dish was savoury topped with perfectly poached eggs served with a naan bread , olives & some hummus."
Twisted Fork,French,"213 Carral Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2J2 Canada",BC,49.2831834,-123.1044482,5,"Outstanding brunch and drinks. The food portion was more than generous. I ordered the eggs Benny and it was unreal it’s a shame we’re heading back home I would love to have had it again. The wait staff was super nice and helpful in guiding us though the menu and more importantly the drinks… get the Caesar!
Lastly the music selection according to my wife was top notch. If your into pop music and are born in 90 give or take a few years you’ll have a blast listening."
Happy Noodle House,Dim Sum,"630 Davie Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2G5 Canada",BC,49.2766734,-123.1257782,5,"One of the best Chinese food experiences of all time. Despite being a hole in the wall place with very little ventilation and no air conditioning, I’d go back there to eat any dish from this place in a heartbeat. Hand-crafted noodles were outrageously awesome and spicy pork dumplings were equally addictive. A place like this is precisely why you travel and explore city streets."
Happy Noodle House,Dim Sum,"630 Davie Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2G5 Canada",BC,49.2766734,-123.1257782,5,"I love this place, the food and my beautiful place. It's a cute little restaurant with great food. They have a great selection of food. My favorite is the chicken soup with handmade noodles. I liked it so much that I went there more than twice in 3 weeks. I think that says enough. In my opinion, it is the little secret restaurant in Vancouver. (The portions are huge, so go there with an empty stomach)"
Happy Noodle House,Dim Sum,"630 Davie Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2G5 Canada",BC,49.2766734,-123.1257782,4,"Tried out this noodle house as it was close to our hotel and looked like a lot of people inside. It's a small Restaurant, with only fans and no air conditioning, so it was quite stuffy inside. Ordered some hot chilli wontons, xiao long bao steamed buns and two types of noodles. Big portions which are enough to share between two. Food came out quickly. The chilli dishes are quite spicy"

I’ll definitely be going back again and again.  The noodle soups are INCREDIBLE— had the pork bone noodle soup which is amazing.  Also had dumplings, curried tofu noodles, fried spicy eggplant, and spicy won ton.   It’s all good and I wish they were open later.  Highly recommend this resto.  Prices are very reasonable, quantities are good, just a great place to go."

By far the most surprisingly delicious dish was the beef roll, a must try. The chili oil wontons definitely have a kick so be prepared if you don’t usually order spicy food.

Lupo,Italian,"869 Hamilton Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2R7 Canada",BC,49.2781964,-123.1173391,5,"Another day, another Italian Restaurant. Browsing through numerous restaurant candidates, I came upon Lupo, a heritage house restaurant offside to my usual Robson area, right by the Vancouver Public Library. One of the things that struck me about the place was the fact that their menu is shockingly small.

Each course from their Antipasti to their Primi to their Secondi boast not more than six options per heading, so I'm guessing that they curated the best of the best. I was intrigued because, in my mind, that meant they had really perfected these dishes and wanted to showcase their culinary prowress with the thoughtful handling of select dishes, so I was expecting a stellar meal.

I don't think I've ever had the pleasure of dining in a heritage house, so there was already an air of charm surrounding the evening as we walked up the steps. I was immediately struck by the eclectic decor, an odd mix of wine bottles, photographic prints, abstract paintings, unusual lighting, and segmented ombre metallics. I'm not sure it necessarily all worked together, but it was definitely eye~catching.

The food was simply fantastic. We started with the popular Focaccia Bread, a puffed vegetarian wonder which, if you didn't know any better, would think was a miniature pizza. My girlfriend had the Octopus Mosaic, which was a work of art, and I had the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, which had a lot of reggiano shavings. Both were delicious.

Mains consisted of the Taglierini and Fettucine, where the portions were more than generous. My only complaint about my Fettuccine was that there were way too many peas, otherwise, both pastas were al dente and very flavorful.

I'm happy to say that all the reviews about Lupo were correct, as it was one of the best Italian Restaurants I've been to in a while, and I would definitely go back. Service was attentive and professional, so you really couldn't ask for more.

There are plenty of Italian eateries downtown, but you can say Arrivederci to them all. Lupo stands out as one of the places you need to visit if you want authentic and tasty Italian food. Make a reservation, you won't be disappointed."
Lupo,Italian,"869 Hamilton Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2R7 Canada",BC,49.2781964,-123.1173391,5,"I had a great evening at Lupo thanks to our server Cristina and the great food.

The food was well presented,  well seasoned and delicious.  The wine menu was very good with a wide range of selection of local and international wines.

The pasta was super greasy with lots of oil left on my plate after I finished my pasta.

The restaurant is very romantic,  but there is no privacy as tables are very close to each other."
Lupo,Italian,"869 Hamilton Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2R7 Canada",BC,49.2781964,-123.1173391,5,"Great intimate dinner spot.

Good selection of wine, they had a special burrowing owl + lupo wine which was really good.

Which was good. Had the special burrata which was nice and refreshing. The special black olive truffle was yummy but the gnocchi bolognese was delicious. They have good portion sizes for the price! I would come again and forgot to mention that they have great service.

Tiramisu was good!"
Lupo,Italian,"869 Hamilton Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2R7 Canada",BC,49.2781964,-123.1173391,4,"Pasta here was pretty good. I ordered the fettuccine and I was surprised with how big the portion was. We also ordered the taglierini which was also quite substantial and tasty. The desserts were great, the almond cake wasn't too sweet and had a lightness to it. The creme brulee was smooth and the bitterness of the hardened sugar on top complimented well with the sweetness of the custard. Service was decent, and the fact that the restaurant is in a heritage house, definitely makes for an interesting experience. A little bit on the pricey side, but a good place to go for a special occasion."
Lupo,Italian,"869 Hamilton Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2R7 Canada",BC,49.2781964,-123.1173391,3,"The pasta was tasty, however clearly inauthentic. Portions were HUGE and flavourful, however the presentation was lacking (feels like I was just given a heaping pile of food). The chicken was not tender, it was clearly overcooked. I did not enjoy the focaccia. The beet salad with goat cheese was alright, but I would never think about it again. The atmosphere of the restaurant was a bit stuffy and serious; I wouldn't return."
Kishimoto Japanese Kitchen,Japanese,"2054 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5N 4A9 Canada",BC,49.2667364,-123.0694112,5,"Love dinning here with my friends!
The food is always delicious and artistic! Love how they support local farmers and have unique high quality ingredients.

When I was poor college student, I usually got the okonomiyaki or one of the stone bowls, one caterpillar roll, and 1 dessert and that was enough to satisfy me and my friend. I usually got something that was high in carbs that way it fills me up. That way it doesn't go over my budget.

Now, I get anything from their special menu, it's always different depending on the seasons. I am never disappointed what I am about to taste.

The service is good and friendly!

The atmosphere there is calming, chill, classy. The music in that restaurant is very relaxing in my opinion.

Also, the tables are always clean and same with the dishes and cutlery.

Tip: This place is quite popular so the wait time to get a table might take long (1hr +). So I suggest you make a reservation, come at 5pm, or eat a small snack before you go but that depends on your eating schedule."
Kishimoto Japanese Kitchen,Japanese,"2054 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5N 4A9 Canada",BC,49.2667364,-123.0694112,4,"This place only opens in the evening. We came around 5:40pm and was told the waiting time would be around 1hr. The wait was worth it tho.

We ordered 2 kinds of oshi which were incredibly delicious but a bit smaller than I expected. Nonetheless, the flavour in each bite were amazing.

The veggie okonomiyaki was surprisingly good even if it's filled with just onions, cabbages and mushrooms. Looks can be deceiving so don't judge this okonomiyaki till you try it."
Kishimoto Japanese Kitchen,Japanese,"2054 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5N 4A9 Canada",BC,49.2667364,-123.0694112,4,"Fantastic little Japanese restaurant in Vancouver. Reminded me a lot of our days in Kyoto. The sashimi was fresh and delicious. My daughter loved her Unagi bowl, given that she's very picky. The Mushroom Agedashi Tofu was the best that I have ever had. Highly recommended. We will definitely come back."
Kishimoto Japanese Kitchen,Japanese,"2054 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5N 4A9 Canada",BC,49.2667364,-123.0694112,2,Very Very good food but service was so poor. we got an appetizer and 4 rolls. everything came at different times I saw delivery and people coming after us getting their food while our food was not fully ready yet.

Didn't try drinks but looked authentic. Had the eel (unagi) rolls. Amazing. The smoked sushi was just ok. Would not get again. Fresh and tasty. A bit pricy, so only go if you appreciate good sushi."

They gave us a plate to put our tempura in so it wouldn’t get soggy when you pour the sauce/soup on top of your rice/noodles. The flavours were good, and I loved the tempura soft boiled egg. I wish the tempura was a bit crispier, but overall, I was happy with my meal."

Not only that,I’ve had better days because of this Strawberry Cheese Cake. Awesome cheesecakes. Not too thick or sparse. Flavours aren’t spot on cloyingly sweet. I can't get enough of their Cheese cake. The staff is really nice and well trained.

The miso soup is wonderful too."

If that's not your thing-- we can't be friends. The egg is mindblowingly delicious! They have udon too now. Specialty drinks are really special.  Great for a date, hang out, families, friends, friends who want to date but haven't have that conversation yet! You know the ones."

Raisu,Japanese,"2340 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6K 1P1 Canada",BC,49.2680595,-123.1583241,5,"This is definitely one of the highest quality sushi restaurants in Vancouver. The price of each meal may not appeal to everyone. However, if I ever wanted to share a solid sushi meal with someone new in town or maybe even a business meal, I would definitely bring them here.

I came here with my wife and kids and the service was excellent. The toro is some of the best I’ve ever had.

This may not be a place that I’d come back to often simply due to affordability, however, If I ever want to celebrate and enjoy high quality sushi, I will come back for sure."
Raisu,Japanese,"2340 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6K 1P1 Canada",BC,49.2680595,-123.1583241,5,"It’s a pretty fantastic Japanese restaurant that focuses on high quality ingredients. We had a large party so we had to put in the order ahead of time. The atmosphere was really nice and the staff were busy but still friendly.

I had the deluxe seafood bowl which was not cheap but the ingredients and the quality of the overall food made it feel like it was worth the hefty price tag.

Other food was generally delicious but if you want the best bang for your buck, I would suggest the katsu.

The cocktails were also quite tasty. I had the yuzu flavoured drink with the yuzu infused ice cream which was perfect on the hot summer evening.

I highly recommend this place for any occasion, but especially birthdays because it seemed like almost every other table was celebrating their birthday. I know this because the staff would come up and sing you a song with a nice dessert. Overall I had a great experience and would come again to try other menu items!"

Raisu,Japanese,"2340 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6K 1P1 Canada",BC,49.2680595,-123.1583241,4,"Definitely one of the best Japanese restaurants in Vancouver.
Food and service were great.
The menu is big.
The rating is also based on the fact that parking is not very convenient and we did not see access for handicapped individuals (maybe we missed it!).
We will try it again and this time we will try reserving in advance the lunch/dinner/bento boxes."

The Luigi’s Meatballs were delicious, with a strong tomato sauce and a generous serving. Only comment here would be it leaned acidic from the strong tomato sauce.
The mushroom and truffle pasta special highlighted the fresh local mushrooms and homemade pasta.
The lamb ragu had incredible depth, demonstrating the effort involved in flawlessly executing this dish."

We were quite lucky to get seated immediately. Megan our server was friendly, amazing and knowledgeable. Full of smiles and ready to answer any of our questions. We went with the specials. The burrata salad with pistachios and asparagus. Delicious! Right amount of seasoning and flavoring. I ordered the lamb ragout. My wife ordered the cacio pepe. You'd think they weren't enough to eat! Wow they were so generous. The portions were perfect.  The lamb was so flavorful to the very last bite. I couldn't get over how good these meals were. My wife asked that her cacio pepe not be too peppery and they were able to accommodate her request. She loved the dish. It was creamy, cheesy with the right amount of pepper. We both noted that their pasta must've been made in house. The perfect chew of the al dente noodles provided a beautiful experience. We topped it off with the Panna cotta which had the stewed plums and crumbly biscotti. Perfect way to end a wonderful dining experience. They are recommended by the Michelin Guide. They are a bit on the pricey side but they are well worth it. This is one of those date night or day places. Quaint and intimate. We absolutely loved our visit here. Thank you Ask for Luigi and to our server Megan, thank you so very much."

From the food, service, to the ambience of the restaurant, it was very good. We went on a weekend and we didn't realize they were only serving  the brunch menu. Nonetheless, the food were still great. I would recommend taking an uber or drive going here because it's a bit sketchy if you'll walk outside."

Reservation is available with a $30 hold (refunded at sign in). My friend and I went for brunch Sunday at 10:30am and it's not very busy. There's a parking lot out back and street parking all around. Our server is very communicative and attentive to our needs. Their cappuccino was delicious (according to my friend) and we thoroughly enjoyed the flavor of our meals. The total came out to be around $60 for the two of us. We also noticed a healthy portion of the menu is vegetarian friendly, and the pasta can be substituted for a gluten friendly version. All in all, a very pleasant visit to this gem of a restaurant."
Ask For Luigi,Italian,"305 Alexander Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1C4 Canada",BC,49.2842,-123.0977177,5,Great place. Simple menu with incredible original Italian taste. The Brunch experience is more “fun” than dinner in my opinion. The olive oil cake 🫒 🍰 I could eat this on a daily basis. To die for. Price is fair due current economy circumstances.

A little eclectic,  but nothing over the top. From the coffees, to the main courses, to the waffles at the end.  We all tried something different and they were all hits. Definitely a go to spot every time we're in town."

It's nice to just walk in and not have to wait.  After taking a first bite of the waffle, I know what all the fuss is about and why it's always so busy!  The food was all very delicious, our server was patient and very attentive and food was so pretty and delicious.  The ambience is cute, cozy and airy and I will 100% come back again!"
Medina Cafe,Breakfast & Brunch,"780 Richards Street Vancouver, BC V6B 3A4 Canada",BC,49.2804066,-123.1168632,5,"Wonderful breakfast spot in downtown Vancouver. Came here two days in a row while being in the city. The service was wonderful and quick. The atmosphere is a plus and gives it a lively yet homey feel. The menu items are all carefully crafted to ensure that all flavours compliment one another. Items are fairly priced but if you’re looking to get a good meal for under 20$ I recommend going with the avocado toast, adding an egg and either adding the sausage or breakfast potatoes to your plate. If you want to spend a little more, I recommend coming for their happy hour 6$ Mimosa’s and Fricassée dish. As a cherry on top you can request their house made waffles either to go or to enjoy while sipping your mimosa. Highly recommend for anyone visiting downtown Vancouver!"

The paella is spicy, yummy and filling. Enough for two people.

Best lavender latte I've had! It's actually has a strong lavender flavor.

Service was very efficient. We came on a Tuesday morning around 9 and got seated right away at the bar."
Medina Cafe,Breakfast & Brunch,"780 Richards Street Vancouver, BC V6B 3A4 Canada",BC,49.2804066,-123.1168632,5,My favourite place for brunch in Vancouver. The menu is unique and food is delicious. I love the waffles and got 2 bags of them for later. Service and atmosphere are great and we waited around 40 minutes for our table. There are plenty of things to do around and they text you when your table is ready.
So Hyang Korean Cuisine,Korean,"6345 Fraser Street Vancouver, BC V5W 3A3 Canada",BC,49.2269997,-123.0909271,4,"We had the Hot pot which was great.. we also tried the seafood pancake and steak, which were a bit on the fatty side.. but still had decent flavor.

Tried some Korean sake too, which was somewhat sweet and packed a kick.

Definitely worth a visit, staff we also friendly"

Food came out relatively quickly. Had the Beef Bulgogi Lunch Combo; I appreciated a non-spicy option with the ""chef's special sauce."" We received the usual shareable tasty banchan, of which we could have seconds. The bulgogi was flavourful and satisfied our Korean food cravings! Our team was topped up regularly by their staff. Good option for a meal with an average price point. There is pay parking along Fraser Street or in the lot behind, as well as some 2-hour parking in the residential areas."
So Hyang Korean Cuisine,Korean,"6345 Fraser Street Vancouver, BC V5W 3A3 Canada",BC,49.2269997,-123.0909271,5,"I went to this restaurant sometime in 2019 and had the hot pot. It was great! Really enjoyed it but for some reason completely forgot about the restaurant until 4 years later when I came back.

With the previous food experience so good, I almost ordered everything off the menu! I sampled a variety of dishes with my partner: the deep fried dumplings, the seafood pancake, beef bulgogi, and bibimbap. All were delicious as I expected. The side dishes and the sauces were great accompaniment to the dishes.

Having said that, I thought the bulgogi had too much beef in it, which I’m not sure it is a bad thing but I was hoping to have more of those delicious glass noodles!

Would definitely come back, this time sooner."
So Hyang Korean Cuisine,Korean,"6345 Fraser Street Vancouver, BC V5W 3A3 Canada",BC,49.2269997,-123.0909271,4,"Food is good overall. Seafood pancake is one of the better ones (sufficiently thick, which I like) I have tried, although I felt there weren't enough octopus pieces (hello inflation). For me, House of Tofu still makes the best seafood pancake I've ever had.

Kimchi tofu soup was decent and the portion was fair. The service was a bit subpar as I usually don't like it when I have to ask for tea refill especially when it isn't even that busy.

Overall, it's a decent and I would say above average Korean restaurant in Vancouver."

Kokoro Tokyo Mazesoba,Japanese,"551 Seymour Street Vancouver, BC V6B 3H6 Canada",BC,49.2834164,-123.1150628,5,"I've had the same mazesoba at their restaurants in Tokyo and this place definitely achieves the same standard.
The flavours of the sauce and toppings mixed together give strong flavours that make you want more! And having the free rice mixed at the end helps you get every last bit in the bowl.
Definitely eat here if you want to try something that packs a lot of savoury flavour into the noodles."
Kokoro Tokyo Mazesoba,Japanese,"551 Seymour Street Vancouver, BC V6B 3H6 Canada",BC,49.2834164,-123.1150628,4,"I visited Kokoro recently and had a delightful experience. The standout dishes for me were the tomato ramen and the spicy ramen. Both were incredibly delicious, and the flavors were well-balanced. The ingredients used in the ramen seemed to be fresh and well cooked, which made the experience way better.

For those with a big appetite, I highly recommend going for the large size. It's perfect for hungry individuals who want a good portion of ramen. The staff at the restaurant were polite, although there wasn't anything exceptional about their service & the general items price feelt to be a bit high, but overall affordable.

The restaurant itself had a fast food setup, ensuring quick service. The spacious and cool ambiance made it an ideal spot for a pleasant evening dinner.

I would definitely suggest giving this place a try, especially if you're a ramen lover looking for a satisfying meal in a comfortable setting."

The gyoza is probably the best I have ever had at any place. Super tender and FULL of flavor. The karaage bao bun was spicy and flavorful and a perfect little bite. However, the ramen was not great. It didn't have much flavor at all. Everyone else in my party got mazesoba and loved it though. I would definitely go back but would try something other than ramen next time."

The staff was friendly and cheery, however the wait for the food was over 30 minutes which can be a little bummer. The food was BEYOND delicious, it was juicy and flavourful. We tried the chicken and gold digga poutine with runny poached eggs. It was hot and tasty, it came in a bowl, which is more than fulfilling. Most of the menu items revolve around eggs, as it’s a brunch place. We also got flight mimosas which was delicious, including flavours such as mango, grapefruit and orange. The restaurant was lively with people. It has both indoor and outdoor seating."

Saku,Japanese,"1588 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2G5 Canada",BC,49.2892453,-123.1323169,5,"The pork, chicken, shrimp katsu is very juicy and tender on the inside. The outside is crunchy and not oily. The sauce is great but sprinkling salt and sesame seems to bring out meat taste more. Do not recommend the white fish as it was slightly soggy at the bottom and the fish was quite tough in the middle. Other white fish I had before is very fluffy and light with a gentle sweetness to it. This one was briny only.

Presentation of the food is great. Seating is wonderfully spacious. Service is quite attentive and friendly.

All in all it was a very pleasant experience. Slightly on the expensive side."

Very popular and I could see why. We got the Zenbu set and it was a lot of food for 2 people. It was so good though. Esp the fatty pork and scallop. Also have to mention the salad. Seems very simple but the dressing is amazing. Service was just fine but the atmosphere was really nice. Will come back for sure."

We had 9 people and was told we would be able to sit together but on separate tables. Unfortunately the tables were really far apart and those on the ends of the table could not talk to each other until after dinner. Aside from that, our dinner itself was good. I ordered the cheese Katsu with a side of curry to share with my husband. Miso soup and salad is refillable and we ordered it twice. Add the curry, you won't regret it :)"
Saku,Japanese,"548 W Broadway Vancouver, BC V5Z 1E9 Canada",BC,49.2631006,-123.1166394,5,I really enjoyed my meal here. Everything part of the dish was very delicious and so intricate with detail. Simple but tasty. Friendly servers. Price point was on the higher side for the full meals but the taste and portion is well worth the total at the end. You can get unlimited sides too I believe.
Saku,Japanese,"548 W Broadway Vancouver, BC V5Z 1E9 Canada",BC,49.2631006,-123.1166394,5,"Saku is certainly worth trying! We ordered the chicken breast katsu with curry and the regular chicken breast katsu - both were great and the service is top notch. The curry was unique and they provide a generous amount which you can share with your party. The side salad and miso soup were perfect additions to the deep fried main dishes, and they’re also unlimited which was nice. The staff are super friendly and the prices seemed fair given the portions."

The cheese katsu is immaculate, and it comes with all these little extras like soup, salad, flavoured salt, mustard. The extras are u limited too! So if you want more soup or salad just ask for it! 😋 The salad dressing they have is delicious too. 🥗

The servers at the Broadway location were incredibly helpful they would come by our table every 5-10 minutes to ask if we wanted more food or to refill our water. 💧

The price is quite expensive but that's the price of living in Vancouver these days. You do get a good amount of food for the price you're paying. 👍"

Jam Cafe on Beatty,Breakfast & Brunch,"556 Beatty Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2L3 Canada",BC,49.2802518,-123.1096515,5,"We visited this place for a weekend brunch. As expected there was a line and we had to wait for around 30 minutes. we got a table outside. It was a bit smaller for a group of five, but we were able to manage. We ordered the French toast and I also tried one of their bowls with hashbrowns and pulled chicken. I loved the food , it was so flavorful and had the perfect quantity. It was a perfect beginning to my day and worth the wait. We also had mimosas with litchi, which was quite a surprise, and it tasted quite good."

""The Jam"" on Beatty street. so we packed up early to beat the line up and got in right away Sunday morning made the orders..... and the aroma from each meal was mouth watering as our server placed each order. I had the Apple cinnamon waffles and they were crazy amazing and hard to finish the whole dish but I managed. I do recommend this breakfast spot to everyone too. 2 thumbs up and thank you Jam"
Jam Cafe on Beatty,Breakfast & Brunch,"556 Beatty Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2L3 Canada",BC,49.2802518,-123.1096515,5,"This breakfast was stellar! Though we were initially worried that we would be standing in line waiting for a long time, we ended up getting in pretty quickly, and sat at the bar. Our server was super personable, and the restaurant manages to seat quite a few parties, despite the smaller space. The fried chicken benedict was wonderful: moist, crispy, chicken, savory little kernels of corn… It was delicious. But the real star of this meal was a cinnamon roll pancake: absolutely, incredible!! Little crunchy bits of buttery, pancake, with a perfect amount of cinnamon and frosting… It truly was one of the best pancakes I’ve ever had. I would absolutely go again for that pancake alone!"

The food was absolutely incredible and the atmosphere was 10/10. We visited both locations which were lovely but preferred the kits location. Our server was an angel and super friendly! The menu has so many interesting options and elevated classics!

Despite its location, the restaurant tends to be bustling, particularly during dinner hours. Without a doubt, we will return here in the future when the chance arises."
Tavola,Italian,"1829 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 3E4 Canada",BC,49.2919265,-123.135706,5,"Visited here for date night and it was so delicious!

We were seated in the patio and the atmosphere was lovely. I appreciated the cushions and throws available as well.

We ordered the fresh burrata with proscuitto, a daily special proscuitto antipasto, Rigatoni Pork Ragu, and the Brick Chicken.

You have to get the proscuitto & fresh burrata - they really do it well. The bread is not too toasted and the burrata is fantastic!

We loved the rigatoni. The pasta had the perfect aldente bite and the sauce was packed with flavour.

The brick chicken was incredible!!! I’ve never tasted a sauce like the one it was served it before - I wished I had bread to soak up all that was leftover. I think it might be my favourite dish of the meal.

Tavola has got classic italian food right! Everything was a hit and a really laidback and romantic atmosphere. Well worth a visit!"

We shared 2 crostinis (Walnut/Gorgonzola; Chicken liver pate) and one each of the brusettas. Gorgeous.
Mixed mains, we shared the Ragu and meatballs. Gorgeous again.

Very tasty food and great service by Kenton. Good portion sizes.

The restaurant is very well laid too too, not at all over crowded. We had one end of the long table and were very comfortable.

Highly recommend."

It was our first time visiting it and we thoroughly enjoyed the romantic vibe it offered. The food was flavourful especially their potato gnocchi with egg plants, olives, basil and tomatoes and ""Cod"" fish of the day from their daily specials. Chickpea crostinis were delicious as well. Our server was friendly and recommended the perfect wines to pair with our food. I definitely recommend it."

Full of flavor, properly served and you will be waiting for the next bite to indulge on the combination of flavors. The dessert is simply prefect, not too sweet yet memorable! We went late night so there were out of paella on a busy Sunday night yet it looked so good and I would definitely recommend giving it a try!"

I thought I would pack some to go, as it's a portion for 2, but I couldn't stop eating it.. Tinto de Verano was exactly the same as I had it in Spain!

It's a romantic date spot, especially in the summer!

Chambar,Belgian,"568 Beatty Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2L3 Canada",BC,49.2801544,-123.109903,4,Visited Chambar with our company and it was a great experience. Had a great table by the window and service was outstanding. Lots of attention to detail. All the appetizers were very tasty and well presented. Great chill atmosphere as well. Only negative really was the bay closing early on a Sunday. But we bounced next door to the pub to enjoy our last rounds. Great spot and the signature lamb dish was amazing. Enjoy!

Chambar Restaurant impressed me with its delectable cuisine and charming ambiance. The menu offers a delightful mix of traditional and innovative dishes, and their attention to using locally-sourced ingredients is commendable. The staff's passion for food and top-notch service made the evening even more enjoyable. If you're a food enthusiast looking for a standout gem, Chambar is the place to be!"
Chambar,Belgian,"568 Beatty Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2L3 Canada",BC,49.2801544,-123.109903,5,"Absolutely amazing food. They were also very good with my food allergies. Not only was I accommodated I had flavorful and amazing food. Went for brunch, which is hard to get my egg, dairy, and gluten allergy accommodated but it was amazing.

They have an amazing gluten free bread, without egg and dairy.

Their bacon and apple side was the most incredible bacon I’ve had in forever. Must get.

Was told their dinner menu is extremely gluten free, dairy free, and egg free friendly."
Chambar,Belgian,"568 Beatty Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2L3 Canada",BC,49.2801544,-123.109903,5,"My aunt and uncle were visiting and I think I couldn’t have booked a better place. I, of course, was drawn by the reviews and the positive feedback of other patrons’ experiences, but these were not fluff marketing ploys.

The food was absolutely amazing! The dishes were unique in both presentation and taste. If you want something DIFFERENT and novel, then this is the place. It may sound corny, but the medley of ingredients that were activating my taste buds was incredible. I’m really curious what the other dishes taste like and that’s why it’s worth revisiting.

The vibe was upbeat and you are made to get into that personable mindset, as the staff members seem to be - from the reception to the initial greeting at the table and the overall service. I would have preferred the tables and seats to be a bit farther apart for more semi-privacy, but packing in that many patrons also made business sense.

It was my uncle’s treat and I think the servers already got the cue from that considering he was the more senior at our table and staff members were engaging him more, but the servers also were not short of properly addressing us when it was our turn to say something. Acknowledgement of presence was never short and I loved it about their service. They’re absolutely attentive and also steadfast. If the water levels on glasses were low, someone was on it and they had that open-hands stance about their demeanor in engaging us. Someone would swing by every now and then to check in on us and the staff members were not snoots. This is probably the best experience I’ve had in a while.

The restaurant is worth a try EXPERIENCING."
Chambar,Belgian,"568 Beatty Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2L3 Canada",BC,49.2801544,-123.109903,5,"I cannot say enough about the service. We found out our server was only in her role for two weeks. She was professional, presentable and knew the menu inside out. You can tell the staff there is cohesively working as one unit and that they really loved being part of the team. When our server was not able to come to our table I believe the general manager popped by - he already knew that we had dietary restrictions. This place is a staple and absolutely one of my favourite places in Vancouver."
Joe Fortes Seafood & Chop House,Seafood,"777 Thurlow Street Vancouver, BC V6E 3V5 Canada",BC,49.284937,-123.124763,4,"I was told by my informant that this is John Cena's favourite restaurant in Vancouver, however...I CAN'T SEE HIM. 🖐👋✋

If you want the best fresh oysters in town, this is the establishment for you. Just make sure you go during happy hour so you can save 💸 as it can be pretty pricey.

My friend and I ate here during happy hour and ordered mostly happy hour items. My friend did however order a steak which he thought was ok, but quite expensive.

I really enjoyed the fresh oysters and I think I'll be coming here just for the oysters, the other items in the happy hour menu were pretty good as well but value could be a bit better.

Service here is amazing. Our server was great, I forgot her name but she was friendly and provided good service.

Overall, I would recommend this place to oyster lovers especially during happy hour. 🦪🍻"

One feels good when as a tourist good eating joints are recommended by the locals. Michael our server was so sweet, kind & helpful to suggest the best of the dish & wine.

Joe Fortes Seafood & Chop House,Seafood,"777 Thurlow Street Vancouver, BC V6E 3V5 Canada",BC,49.284937,-123.124763,5,"By far the best Happy Hour Menu in Downtown! I would recommend going here if you are in the area. The seafood tower for the price is enough for 2 people. The beef carpaccio was so good! Service was quick, and our server was nice. I highly suggest you book ahead if you want to try their Happy Hour without waiting in line."

I enjoyed the flavorful soup and tender beef. The only issue was how slow the food service was. It took around 20 mins for the food to come. Otherwise, this place is definitely worth trying!"

The food doesn't feel fresh. My friend ordered the unagi a week ago and said that it was very fishy to the point she pushed it away after the first bite.

I ordered the beef bowl and the taste was great- only problem was that the beef was rubbery hard. Hard to chew like rubber, hard to swallow. With my friend's comment about this place and my current experience...

I don't think the food is very fresh.

I think this is for a person's personal experience. Perhaps the beef was meant to be like rubber because of its cooked methods.

And I haven't been to this place for all its food so it's hard to comment. But my first impression of it was not so good. I would say that one can give this place a chance, but that person might meet the same experience that my friend and I had.

The sauce and appearance of the dish was very good though.

They have 6 different sets of meals. You order at the counter first and they bring the food out to your table. The food was decent. It’s nice they come with a variety of side dishes. The meal was $16. I also ordered the mango or passion fruit soda and it was pretty good.

Nightingale,Live/Raw Food,"1017 West Hastings Street Vancouver, BC V6E 0C4 Canada",BC,49.2873812,-123.1174873,5,A delicious experience. We sat on the upper floor with a view of the kitchen.

I read good things, and we decided to stop in.  It was great - the hostess was nice and bartender was friendly and fantastic.  The meatballs and ""pizza bread"" hit the spot.  We're definitely interested in trying it for dinner the next time we come back to Vancouver."
Nightingale,Live/Raw Food,"1017 West Hastings Street Vancouver, BC V6E 0C4 Canada",BC,49.2873812,-123.1174873,4,"I've been to Nightingales probably 3-4 times now and each time it's been pretty good.
We came for happy hour this time. We had the fried chicken, fries, pepperoni pizza and the Margherita pizza.
The pizza was thin and chewy. Lots of toppings. Just the right amount of savouriness.
The fries were probably my favourite. Could be a bit crispier. The spice on the outside gives it a bit of sourness which makes it somewhat addicting.
I get the fried chicken every time I come. They sweetness balances off everything nicely and the pickles are just the cherry on top.
Every time I come, the service is always very nice and friendly and this time was no exception. If you want to go somewhere to hang out with friends with okay food and drinks and a laid back atmosphere with decent service. This would be my choice downtown"

Maenam,Thai,"1938 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 1M5 Canada",BC,49.2678675,-123.148895,5,"An excellent spot for enjoying Thai cuisine, offering a delightful and reasonably priced dining experience. The quality of the food is exceptional, particularly the dumplings, vegetarian green curry, and coconut soup, which we found to be incredibly delicious. Similar to many establishments in Vancouver, this place caters to a diverse range of dietary preferences, ensuring that even vegans have at least one suitable choice. Additionally, their happy hour drinks are highly enjoyable.

One aspect that stood out to us was the variety of options available on the menu. Whether you were a meat lover, a vegetarian, or a vegan, there were numerous choices to suit every palate. It was refreshing to see a restaurant that prioritized inclusivity and catered to different dietary needs without compromising on taste or quality.

During our visit, we decided to explore the happy hour offerings, and we were not disappointed. The selection of drinks was impressive, with a range of creative and well-crafted cocktails, along with other beverage options. It was a fantastic opportunity to try something new and indulge in refreshing concoctions that complemented the flavors of the food perfectly."

Love Thai cup cake at first bit. usually I always let my camera eat first but this meal I enjoyed it so much completely forgot to shoot photos
Wine pairing both options (BC & French flight )are prefect pair with food and dessert I ordered them twice as perfect match !
Highly recommended"
Maenam,Thai,"1938 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 1M5 Canada",BC,49.2678675,-123.148895,3,"Note that Maenam only does tasting menu if you reserve. This was not clear on their website or during reservations, even if you read it now, it doesn't say a la carte is only available for walk ins.

Besides that the food overall was good but nothing wow'd us which I was expecting for a Micheline guide recommended restaurant.

$88pp for 4 courses ( menu said for an overall 11 dishes - FYI the appies were 4 hours derve sized bites which accounted for 4 dishes)

Appies - 4/5, loved all of them but nothing over the top special

Bison Salad- 0/5 it was soo salty it tasted bitter

Halibut coconut sour soup - 2/5
Didn't quite give us the kick expected
It jusy tasted like a coconut broth

They offered us the shrimp salad after which we enjoyed ,the shrimp was definitely undercooked, you can still see the raw center but I trust that it's sashimi grade and ate Nothing special ( taste more like a Viet dish) 3/5

Sablefish curry - 5/5 fish was cooked perfectly, more very flavourful and perfect with rice

Pork belly pad cha - 3/5 good but nothing special

Desert- Hazelnut cake and coconut jelly 2/5
Hazlenut cake got soggy from the sauce but I loved the brulee on top
Coconut jelly was super dense, I think they might have used too much agar agar, but it wasn't too sweet and had a lot of ( what felt like) fresh coconut meat.

Overall a good dining experience but missed the mark for us on many things. We probably won't be back.
For comparison, we really enjoy Sawasdee for Thai food, taste is on point and authentic but obv they're atmosphere and plating is not compatible.

A little dissapointed since we had high hopes"

Steak was cooked to perfection and the three layer dessert was a perfect blend. Would definitely come back."

Excellent service , Alice was very friendly and helpful about the service and the menu detail. And we end up with 8 dishes for 2 people. We seem like very dish quite interesting. The steak is very tender and soft and serve with watercress salad  so so good. The pho noodle is yummy very concentrated in flavor and clear broth. Octopus with lime sauce is refreshing and go very well with seafood. The prawn fritters is eatable till trail . The bone marrow does not have much substance, maybe we aren’t lucky this time, it’s mostly bone. Spring rolls were fantastic, when you bite into it, you can feel a mouthful of ingredients exploding in your mouth, highly recommend this place !!  We will come back again. And the Pandan desserts is amazing good combination with ice cream!!"

My first time trying this local bustling joint, I had hesitated as it seemed a bit more western and mainstream. However, I was massively incorrect.
The grub here is PHOnomenal, super yummy, dope plentiful portions of authentic Vietnamese grub at its finest with reasonable prices for the area. I hauled a portion of Mixed Vegetables and Fried Tofu, perfect I loved it and wolfed it down. The joint is super cool, love the asethetics and a fantastic vibe. There's also a bunch of really nice outdoor benches to park your bit in the sun whilst having a chow down.
I'm stoked to return, this was a rad experience of many and an awesome feast.

On coming in at the time assigned to us, seating was quick. Our server was excellent and helped us put together a meal off the menu (where everything was sounding good).  We ordered the garlic fried noodles, bone marrow, stir fried vegetables, and steak. The bone marrow was tasty and fun to eat. The noodles were flavourful with a good bite to them but a tad dry. The vegetables were nice and not your usual mix. Finally, the steak was good but we had pretty high expectations coming in.  We ordered the sticky rice cake ice cream and it was marvellous!"
Lunch Lady,Vietnamese,"1046 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5L 3W9 Canada",BC,49.274972,-123.0693501,5,"Visiting from Chicago. My Lord. Make this a stop if you want fun, interesting food. Started off with this octopus, don’t sleep on this green sauce it’s a little spicy and a whole lot of delicious. The bone marrow was decadent and balanced out with the lime. I also had an interesting Cod dish that was served over a fire. I didn’t love the sauce it was served with but Alex was quick to offer another suggestion for a garlicky fish sauce thing that was amazing.

Both Alex and the other female bartender were great. Normally you just get one of the two bar tenders to give you attention. They were a great tag team helping everyone at the bar.

Probably about 15 minutes away from my hotel. Well worth the Uber to get outside of the touristy spots outside of the Stanley park area."

Jingle Bao,Asian Fusion,"774 Denman Street Vancouver, BC V6G 1C9 Canada",BC,49.2916234,-123.1348781,5,"We tried their sampler and although some of the dishes were not our favorites, we enjoyed the experience nonetheless. Three of us shared the sampler (lots of food). We all really enjoyed the Jingle Bao's (multi coloured/assorted flavors), however, I personally would have been happy with just the classic, but we were game for trying new things. The chicken was good and the edamame and a few other things but I don't remember what theybwere called. One of the tables had some napkins on the floor that one of the waitresses missed picking up but everything else was clean and we were seated quickly and served promptly."
Bao Bei Chinese Brasserie,Chinese,"163 Keefer Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1X3 Canada",BC,49.2796534,-123.1006157,4,"I enjoyed our dining experience at Bao Bei, but found the cuisine a bit confused. We asked the server for recommendations and she suggested half the menu, so of course we obliged.

We got marinated eggplant as an appetizer, prawn dumplings, pea shoots, prawn fried rice, and halibut. The star of the meal was definitely the pea shoots and the strangest was likely the fried rice, which tasted like a fusion of Korean and Indian, which was a bit unexpected considering the traditional Chinese menu.

The vibe was cool, dimly lit, and sat small and large tables. We had quick service and left full. The entire meal may have been a bit expensive, but we're glad we tried it once."

The food takes a very very long time to arrive. It was an average Tuesday, yes it was busy but I’ve never been to busy restaurant where it takes 2 hours to get “fried rice” and some “ Wagyu meat”. The staff was nice keeping us updated but dam, we waited a long time. On a more positive note, I love their cocktails. I recommend the Nai Nai punch and in a hot day the Tokyo Long Island Slushi."

Western people may like it cuz it’s for their taste to cook but if you are Asian don’t go there you won’t be satisfied with their food! Overall, they did really good job on their vibe and food and every Chinese elements"
Bao Bei Chinese Brasserie,Chinese,"163 Keefer Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1X3 Canada",BC,49.2796534,-123.1006157,5,"Family owned and delightfully chic bistro with spectacular food. We went for the chefs choice menu and were not disappointed. Stars were: crispy fried silken tofu, cold eggplant with ginger, bao, peashoots. Wonderful selection of mocktails and cocktails with delightful service. Just a really solid place built on family traditions and a love for fresh local ingredients prepared perfectly."

There $55 per person option is more than worth it and nearly every dish is 5/5. Fast service, kind staff, and overall enjoyable night. Perfect for a group of 2-3 for relatively quick bite."

The food is absolutely delicious, with a menu that offers plenty of options to choose from. But what really sets this restaurant apart is the atmosphere - it's the perfect spot to catch up with friends over a meal and drinks. The staff are friendly and welcoming. Overall, I highly recommend checking out this restaurant for a memorable dining experience in Vancouver."
Cactus Club Cafe,Canadian (New),"1085 Canada Place Vancouver, BC V6C 3E1 Canada",BC,49.2894022,-123.1180433,3,"I recently dined at Cactus Club Restaurant and wanted to share my thoughts. Although there was a delay in receiving our food, the staff was incredibly friendly and made us feel welcome throughout our visit. The restaurant itself had a great ambiance and provided a pleasant environment for our meal.
One area of improvement would be the selection of non-alcoholic drinks, which was somewhat limited. It would be nice to see a wider variety of options in that regard. On the other hand, I must commend the kitchen on the fantastic calamari. It was cooked to perfection and had a delicious flavor that left me wanting more.
However, I found the ravioli with shrimp to be a bit too sweet for my taste. While it may appeal to those who enjoy sweeter flavors, I personally would have preferred a more balanced taste.
Overall, my experience at Cactus Club Restaurant was positive, with the standout being the delightful calamari. Despite the minor setbacks, I would still recommend visiting for a friendly atmosphere and memorable dining experience."
Cactus Club Cafe,Canadian (New),"1085 Canada Place Vancouver, BC V6C 3E1 Canada",BC,49.2894022,-123.1180433,4,"A very large restaurant with gorgeous views over the harbour! The staff was very kind and the food was great, though my chicken sandwich was better than the tofu bowl (which lacked sauce and was a bit dry). Really good fries! The cocktail menu was large and the cocktails themselves were very tasty, too.

While the views were lovely, the restaurant was VERY loud and it could be difficult to hear the person sitting across from you!"

I had salmon for dinner and it was delicious. I sat in the dining room with a water view. Most people wore sunglasses because the sun was bright and bold at 8pm at night! My waiter was awesome. I wish I remembered his name. It’s a crowed place, so make reservations early. They have outside eating and since it’s right on the water side, it’s a great place to take a stroll afterwards."

enjoyed it. Our servicer, Blaize, was very knowledgeable and friendly.  She knows everything about the beer and the food . We were amazed by how much she knew about everything on the menu.  She is super nice and outgoing.  We ordered  craft beer , a couple flights.  The wings we ordered were delicious and loved our beer.  We will definitely invite our friends and come back again."

We came for their happy hour and it delivered. Snack size poutine was delicious. There tacos were probably some of the best I’ve ever had which is saying a lot. Pretzel buns and cheese sauce was not too bad. We each got a flight of their beers and each one had a unique flavour. Highly recommend checking this place out. The vibe is amazing and the people are super friendly. We’ll be back forsure.

I decided to try something new and ordered the pork belly burger, which was absolutely delicious. Additionally, the fries were cooked to perfection and had an excellent flavor. The service was prompt and friendly. Overall, a superb place in Gastown that I'll definitely return to in the future."

I really enjoyed their nigiri sushi and their special rolls. My friend got their yakiudon and said it tasted good as well. The presentation was nice and the restaurant wasn’t too busy at 1pm on a Saturday.
Tom Sushi,Sushi Bars,"1175 Davie St Vancouver, BC V6E 1N2 Canada",BC,49.2816505,-123.1326617,4,"One of our favourite sushi spots in Vancouver! So delicious.  I hate when sushi has too much sauce, but the sauce to rice to fish ratio here is just perfect.

Our group ordered take out and they took our phone number, however we waited for a text or call back for pick up and they never contacted us!! We also stood by the door but never saw our food bags come to the front. They also never came out to tell us our food was ready. Quite annoying giving how long we had to wait until we asked them."

A bit slow because of how busy it was, but not intrusive or bothersome by any means. Portions were generous and great for sharing and the prices were really good. Expect to wait for about an hour or more to get a table as this is a small restaurant that is very popular. Our table spent about $25 per person for 1 appetizer and 7 rolls to share."

The sashimi is so fresh and melts in your mouth. Amazingly inexpensive for the quality. Additionally to the sushi, get the cheese loin Katsu and thank me later. Service is always good but definitely prepare to wait, they don't take reservations. We went on a Saturday afternoon, just past lunch time and waited 30mins - worth it for the experience. The restaurant itself is pretty small so prepare to wait longer for parties bigger than 4"
AnnaLena,Canadian (New),"1809 W 1st Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 5B8 Canada",BC,49.2708117,-123.1468222,5,"One of the top restaurants in Vancouver. Great food, service and atmosphere. The reservation is hard to get and it’s a bit pricey but you get what you paid for. We did wine pairing on our visit and discovered a few great wines. The only downside the wine portions were quite small for the price and also additional caviar was not worth the price. Overall highly recommended to get there at least once."
AnnaLena,Canadian (New),"1809 W 1st Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 5B8 Canada",BC,49.2708117,-123.1468222,5,"This is a wonderful restaurant located on West 1st, close to the beach, and a wine store next door. Very awesome space, the food and service definitely match up to it.

It’s one of the Michelin star restaurants in Vancouver and it’s definitely earned its reputation. The food was absolutely delicious and carefully crafted. Every bite was perfect and everything just seemed to work well.

The cocktails were also delicious and matched well with the dishes.

The dessert was fresh and gave a palette cleansing experience - definitely another highlight from an already amazing dinner.

If you’re worried about being hungry after the tasting menu, you won’t be. It definitely will fill you. I don’t think you even need to opt for the add ons, but I found it filling.

Don’t worry about parking either as there is plenty of paid parking in the area. We got lucky and found one right outside the restaurant but cars come and go quite often enough.

I would highly recommend coming here, but book well in advance as they fill up quickly."
AnnaLena,Canadian (New),"1809 W 1st Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 5B8 Canada",BC,49.2708117,-123.1468222,5,"The first time I have visited AnnaLena and I can say it truly deserves the Michelin start that it got last November.

The servers are extremely knowledgable about their menu, and their memory is impeccable. Every dish was served in unison and the balance of flavours is perfect with every dish.

There was not a single dish we did not like but the torn bread was definitely the highlight of the night. All of us left satisfied and full (rare for a restaurant like this).

5-stars for a 5-star restaurant"

We could only get bar seats, and the corner we sat was kinda dark. We couldn't see the dishes clearly or take good pics of it. Thankfully, our taste buds could still savour them. Recommended!"

We definitely get to try somethings that we otherwise wouldn’t order. The bread in the clam sauce was a highlight. I also liked very much how the scallop and beef was cooked and seasoned. Some other dish fell flat for me, but was still pleasant surprises."
Chinatown BBQ,Chinese,"130 E Pender Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1T3 Canada",BC,49.2801868,-123.1014854,5,"We had to check out the Chinatown scene! As someone visiting from Chinatown in the south, we needed authentic Chinese food before we boarded a 7 day cruise. This place did not disappoint and dare I say, it was our best meal in Vancouver and on our vacation! We got the mixed BBQ plate- and everything was cooked perfectly. The pork in Canada is better...I'm not sure why.. but it's not as salty as in the states, so the Chinese bbq pork has a more subtle sweet flavor here. I loved that they gave the ginger scallion sauce with the soy sauce chicken. Excellent salted egg that matches beautifully with well cooked rice. The tea was perfect- wonderful floral notes matches perfectly with the BBQ. We ate everything and wished for the remainder of the trip that we had ordered some food to go too! If you can, go early to avoid a wait. And, it's a great value!!!"
Chinatown BBQ,Chinese,"130 E Pender Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1T3 Canada",BC,49.2801868,-123.1014854,5,"Greeted by a roast rack packed to the brim with finely cooked Chinese BBQ within a clean, old Chinatown themed experience. This is the most authentic BBQ within Vancouver’s Chinatown. They do not go overboard on the seasoning and salt, allowing the natural flavors of the meat to shine. It is still imperative to pair the BBQ with a neutral side dish, such as rice or noodles to complete this experience."
Chinatown BBQ,Chinese,"130 E Pender Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1T3 Canada",BC,49.2801868,-123.1014854,5,"An absolutely delicious plate of food, the Three Treasures gave us the perfect sampling of what Chinatown BBQ has to offer.

I came back after a long absence but pleased the same outstanding quality of their roasted pork (sui yok) is still there. The restaurant is comfortably lit (lighting is soothing, not overly bright).

Seiza,Japanese,"3068 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5T 3G5 Canada",BC,49.2578688,-123.1008956,5,"Nice selection of food shown in a beautiful menu. They taste as good as they look too. The seafood cabbage cake (okonomiyaki) was one of our favorites, and the salmon tempura was a good unique appetizer. Everything was flavorful but light, a very nice balance. The decor and ambience was modern casual, good for both families and hipsters alike. In fact, we saw several families with young kids devouring plates of sushi rolls happily :)"

The chef roll tasted so good and unique, I would highly recommend if you like sashimi to try this roll with many fish inside. It's a bit pricey, but the quality is very good here!

Seiza,Japanese,"3068 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5T 3G5 Canada",BC,49.2578688,-123.1008956,5,"Servers can explain any dish we do not know. Service is fast but not rushed. We were able to sit comfortably and eat without interruption, around 9 pm. Great atmosphere, low light setting. We got the hamachi carpaccio, salmon carpaccio, cheese katsu, miso eggplant, and beef sushi that I don't recall the spelling of. All were amazing, I wish I could eat miso eggplant like this at home! Would love to be back next time we are in Vancouver."

I recently celebrated a birthday here and brought my own cake. The hostess advised that there would be a plating fee of $4.50 per person. Fair enough, it is a hassle for the restaurant to deal with this. They plated the cake and used piping to decorate the plates with chocolate and caramel swirls. They also garnished the plate with mint and whipped cream! Wow! So impressed.

The food of course was fantastic."

Every dish had a special and unique taste, and our server, Brian, provided me with friendly food explanations and top-notch service throughout the meal. His service, escorting me out after the meal, was a really nice touch and the best service I've ever received. He was professional, and I was genuinely happy. I hope to receive this kind of service again on my next visit."

Since the moment we entered until we left, everything was great. We visited at the first time of the evening and it looked like they had an issue in the kitchen, which was quickly and gently solved by the staff offering some appetizers to the whole restaurant. We tried the mushroom soup, the braised lamb, a featured turbot fish with pasta, orange creme brûlée and profiteroles. They were all exceptional, except for the fish that we felt it missed something. But still not enough to not give a 5 star to this place."
Linh Cafe,Vietnamese,"1428 Granville Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 1N2 Canada",BC,49.2746224,-123.129706,5,"Incredible food, lovely drinks and great service all in a really beautiful space.

We were delighted to get a reservation here for Valentine's Day. Even on a night where you would expect it to be super busy, the service was still dialled in! All of the staff were super friendly and efficient, food came quickly and the whole dining area was nice and spacious. We never felt like we were too close to other guests or that it was ever too loud.

Linh Café has done a really great job in every way, this is what hospitality is all about!"
Linh Cafe,Vietnamese,"1428 Granville Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 1N2 Canada",BC,49.2746224,-123.129706,3,"Food was great but service was poor.

First of all, the restaurant does not accept reservations for a party smaller than 6 or 8 (can’t remember exactly but we have 5 ppl). Therefore, we purposely arrived earlier for dinner which was around 5:20pm. We were immediately told by the host that we need to finish our dinner by 7:15pm in order to let the next reserved party sit down. That sort of rubbed us in the wrong way to begin with but we accepted the challenge.

Then more issues with our waitress. She was very polite but I think this is more of a training issue for her. She was filling our glasses with a Red Sangria but it was dripping all over the table then it dripped on my friend’s light color dress! She was apologetic and helped my friend to clean it. Then once again, she reminded us we will need to finish dinner by 7:15pm. During the whole dinner, she was constantly interrupting our conversation by collecting empty dishes or even unfinished dishes! At one point, she collected all of our utensils and plates but there was still food left to eat! We were already quite annoyed by that. It feels like the kitchen was out of dishes and plates that they needed to collect them as soon as the customers are somewhat done with the food.

Finally, we were paying the bill and our waitress brought over the credit card machine but basically walked right up to our friend’s back and leaned over against him. That’s the reason why we believe all of this is more of a training issue. She needs to learn to give space and privacy to their customers (and how to pour properly)! This is a higher end Vietnamese restaurant and the service certainly did not feel that way."
Linh Cafe,Vietnamese,"1428 Granville Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 1N2 Canada",BC,49.2746224,-123.129706,5,"Never disappointed in this restaurant.

They don’t take reservations you have to go early to write down your names and line up. The line can be long from 30 minutes up to an hour or so.

Make sure you go there early so you can get the mussels before it sold out. It was the best mussels I ever had before. Too bad we couldn’t order this time. The snails is really rich and tasty. I could eat a whole bread with the snails sauce. The lobster benny is pretty good, but the portion a bit small compared to the price. Clam is good but we were too busy with the snails."
Linh Cafe,Vietnamese,"1428 Granville Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 1N2 Canada",BC,49.2746224,-123.129706,5,"Based on a recommendation from a YouTuber review, my friend and I decided to try LINH CAFE, a French-Vietnamese fusion restaurant in town. The sleek and modern building immediately caught our attention as we walked in. The interior is chic and comfortable - perfect for a girls' get-together or a selfie session.

After perusing the extensive menu, we decided to try a variety of dishes. We started with the YELLOWFIN TUNA TARTARE, which had a strong sesame oil flavor that overpowered the dish. However, the homemade potato chips served alongside it were exceptionally crispy with a bold potato flavor. We wished we could have ordered the chips alone as a snack.

Next, we had the NEM - CHẢ GIÒ - SPRING ROLL, which my friend loved. While I found it to be a bit salty for my liking, the filling was delicious and well-seasoned.

The CHICKEN LIVER was served with a creamy dijon mustard sauce that complemented the dish well. However, we felt it could have been even better if the liver had been marinated prior to cooking.

The FRIED FROG LEGS were a standout dish for us. Seasoned with garlic, butter, chili flakes, and fresh herbs, the frog legs were incredibly tender and perfectly complemented by the garlic butter. I highly recommend trying it!

The DUCK BREAST wasn't as impressive as we had hoped. While it was served with glazed apples and grapes, we found the fruits to be the highlight of the dish. The duck breast itself seemed overcooked and lacked the desired tenderness.

Lastly, we tried the PHỞ BÒ with braised beef brisket, rice noodles, and bone marrow. We were blown away by the rich and flavorful beef bone soup base and the perfectly cooked rice noodles. The bone marrow, however, wasn't to our liking.

To end our meal on a high note, we indulged in the restaurant's delicious bread. It was so good that we each finished an entire loaf!

Overall, LINH CAFE offers a unique and delicious dining experience with a beautiful atmosphere. Some dishes may need minor adjustments, but the quality of the food and the attentive service make it worth checking out."
Linh Cafe,Vietnamese,"1428 Granville Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 1N2 Canada",BC,49.2746224,-123.129706,3,"Always wanted to check out this place and finally did today.

There was a line up to get in.  It was busy but the space inside is huge.

Menu didn’t have any vegetarian options therefore I asked my server.  She recommended noodles with vegetables which is not on the menu.

It was delicious, very flavourful.  And huuuge!  And quite pricey 💵💵💵
BUT no protein 😬"
The Fish Counter,Fish & Chips,"3825 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3P2 Canada",BC,49.2507837,-123.1012792,5,Really enjoyed the cod fish and chips. Loved that their fries are fresh handcut fries. The fish was very fresh - looking forward to trying other fish types and items. We ate on the bench outside with our dog and it was the perfect casual dinner.
The Fish Counter,Fish & Chips,"3825 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3P2 Canada",BC,49.2507837,-123.1012792,5,"After a long and rewarding stroll from downtown to the Bloedel conservatory, I enjoyed one of the best , if not the best, fish and chips of my life. I was recommended to try the halibut and, oh boy! Heavenly, not oily at all, crispy and light, seasoned to perfection. A generous serving of fish on a bed of fantastic fries, coleslaw and tartar dip. Super friendly staff, cool and laidback interior, with some seating by the window. Really really recommended, as they focus on local, seasonal and sustainable seafood. Really awesome!"
The Fish Counter,Fish & Chips,"3825 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3P2 Canada",BC,49.2507837,-123.1012792,5,"Its usually halibut, salmon, or cod managed to veer off my typical menu choices and explore the Arctic Char for my Fish and Chips order.

From the onset, the service representative demonstrated a commendable level of hospitality and eagerness to cater to this unique request since it was not on the menu that was very nice of them.

Now, onto the main event - the Arctic Char Fish and Chips. To say it was superb would be an understatement. The perfectly fried Arctic Char exceeded all my expectations. It was succulent and full of flavour, pairing harmoniously with the crispy chips. This dish struck a perfect balance between the delicate fish and the satisfyingly crunchy chips. Its like a perfect balance between trout and salmon in taste.

This was, without a doubt, the best Arctic Char Fish and Chips I have ever had in Canada. Their tartar sauce is also to die for they now sell it in mason jars great choice.

Rating: 5/5 Stars"

Fries and halibut chips were outstanding and cooked in a separate safe frier. Worth the trek. Also got the dairy free clam chowder!
The Fish Counter,Fish & Chips,"3825 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3P2 Canada",BC,49.2507837,-123.1012792,5,We are repeat customers!  This is the best fish and chips shop in the city and I am very sure it is not close. Loved it all today!  And a big fan of the new scallop bites.  Fun!

Beautiful decorated inside, it’s a huge location inside, and the food is super delicious! Loved the crispy chicken and the pasta dish. The spicy 🌶 squid octopus 🐙 with the seaweed chips! Can’t wait to come celebrate 🎊 my birthday 🎂 here!"
Suika,Japanese,"1626 W Broadway Vancouver, BC V6J 1X6 Canada",BC,49.2634105,-123.1416899,5,"Dined here this week and didn’t have reservation ahead so we had to wait 20minutes before we were seated. The place was very busy on a Monday evening and noticed they had a few birthday shout outs happening back to back. They bring out a cake or dessert of some type with a light up apparatus accompanied by drums and singing and the music volume is turned up and all the staff yells happy Birthday!! As soon as we were seated, the server greeted us, brought out waters and menus right away! Awesome! I was hungry already smelling all the delicious dishes all around me! Since they were busy the server asked if it was okay to bring the food as they come! Everything was so delicious! The oxtail Ramen broth was exactly as I imagined. Heads up, this does not come with a lot of meat so must be ordered on top of your main dish! The Blue fin Toro belly melted like butter- it was so good! The salmon carpaccio was very light and flavourful and not as fishy as I thought. My husband loved taco wasabi. It is definitely for someone who loves seafood and spicy food. We also ordered chestnut dessert and it was surprisingly delicious! Can’t complain! Over all it was a delightful experience! Will definitely be visiting again and highly recommended."
Suika,Japanese,"1626 W Broadway Vancouver, BC V6J 1X6 Canada",BC,49.2634105,-123.1416899,5,We celebrated our friend's birthday here which was really fun! Our server was attentive and friendly. The food was made so that you can share out amongst the group or to yourself. I loved their chicken karaage and ebi mayo! I liked that they had a great selection of drinks. Would come back again!

I got the Chirashi Set which was amazing in every bite. They also accommodated my shrimp allergy by making sure to use different utensils to prepare the dish.

One of the best/most authentic izakaya you can find in Vancouver.

The servers went above and beyond to even open the door for us as we exited. Super Japanese hospitality!"
Hei Hei Rice Roll,Chinese,"2430-8260 Westminster Highway Richmond, BC V6X 1A7 Canada",BC,49.1697285,-123.1330757,4,"If you’re craving for rice rolls, this is the spot to go. Great texture and flavours that combine well together to give you a satisfying and full stomach after eating. Although it is located in the Richmond Public Market food court, don’t let it fool you you as wait times can peak beyond an hour. There was a 20min wait ordering at 11am on a Saturday morning, but quickly jumped to a 45min to 1 hour wait by the time we finished. Beef rice roll was comparatively better than the shrimp rice roll which had lacklustre shrimp."
Hei Hei Rice Roll,Chinese,"2430-8260 Westminster Highway Richmond, BC V6X 1A7 Canada",BC,49.1697285,-123.1330757,4,"As far as rice rolls ago, I quite enjoyed this place. The congee was great too, although there was an aftertaste to the pork, so it properly wasn’t super fresh.
But overall, I would come back here for the rice rolls although there is a long wait. It was a 50min wait for our order, but the line never died down. So that was understandable and I had a chance to do some shopping as I waited, it was not a huge issue."
Hei Hei Rice Roll,Chinese,"2430-8260 Westminster Highway Richmond, BC V6X 1A7 Canada",BC,49.1697285,-123.1330757,5,"Great place for congee and rice roll. Well worth the 30 min wait.

Ordered the Hei Style Sampan Congee and Preserved Vegetable & Pork Rice Roll combo. Got $2.50 off with the combo. Both were equally tasty.

The Osmanthus and Fermented Rice Fresh Soy Milk was also very good.

Will definitely be coming back."

This place makes the rice noodles by scraping it off the instead of rolling itx emphasizing texture and silkiness. We got the pork, beef, and schrimp, and the pork and beef rice rolls. The soysauce is also to die for! Good prices for a nice cheap lunch located in a historic and cozy foodcourt. Unfortunately, by the time we went, the congee was sold out so didn't get to try that."
Hei Hei Rice Roll,Chinese,"2430-8260 Westminster Highway Richmond, BC V6X 1A7 Canada",BC,49.1697285,-123.1330757,4,There is an emphasis of trying this spot because of the texture (silkiness and thinness) of the rice rolls. It was very well done and in the style where it's not wrapping the toppings. It does get relatively busy here even on a weekday but took about 15 mins from ordering to get the food. The congee and rice roll combo is a decent deal at around $14 (dependent on type of rice roll you choose as some are more premium). Congee is thick and has a lot of content. This spot does not accept card and it's cash only or via WeChat/Alipay. Worth going here to grab a meal. Best to eat fresh. There was about 9 shrimps in the rice roll; a reasonable amount.
The Mackenzie Room,Canadian (New),"415 Powell Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1G7 Canada",BC,49.2833009,-123.0949246,5,"WOW. Location is a bit sketchy to say the least.....notwithstanding, the minute you enter you're welcomed by passionate and knowledgeable staff. If you are a foodie this is a MUST TRY location. Best option is the, ""I WANT IT ALL"" option ($85/person). It's a 12 course tapas share option, of delicious pallet popping delights, where you get to try the entire Chef's Creations. Only catch is you need a minimum of 4 people to try this. So get your double date on and try this place. You'll thank me later.  CHEERS!!!

PS- There is also a very creative signature cocktails menu if you so desire."

Each dish was beautifully decorated, accompanied by delicious sauce. Chicken of the sea is a must eat. Lamb tartare was not smelly at all, flavoured with lemon and capers. Trout was fluffy and seasoned well. Quite pricey for the portion but recommend this place to everyone for quality food."

Would definitely come back!"
The Mackenzie Room,Canadian (New),"415 Powell Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1G7 Canada",BC,49.2833009,-123.0949246,5,"I came in for Dine out this past Sunday and was impressed. We sat at the bar and our server gave us great service.

The food was delicious in my opinion. The stand out dishes were the chicken of the sea and the pork dish. I also ordered a non alcoholic ginger beer for $5 which I thought was a great price for the taste . Overall I thought for the food and service, the price we paid was fair.

I would definitely come back with 4 people to try the full tasting menu.

Areas for improvement would be check the chairs/stools to make sure they're level as mine was wobbly. Not a huge thing but it's a small fix that I think would improve the experience.

Also I would recommend Ubering as the area is unfortunately very sketchy. If you are going to walk, I'd recommend parking in the neighborhood with houses more south and then walking."
The Mackenzie Room,Canadian (New),"415 Powell Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1G7 Canada",BC,49.2833009,-123.0949246,5,"Fabulous food, tastes better than The Published. Good ambience and wait staff were professional, courteous and welcoming.

Dessert could be a little bit better. The flan was a bit too sweet and dense. Great overall experience and would rate the restaurant as a solid 9/10 or 4.5 out of 5."
La Belle Patate,Fast Food,"1215 Davie Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1N4 Canada",BC,49.2820333,-123.1335487,5,"Absolutely legendary. Fries were still crisp under the copious amount of gravy. Lots of squeaky cheese curds. Great smoked meat sandwich too. Service was a little whatever when we went though, maybe funner at night"
La Belle Patate,Fast Food,"1215 Davie Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1N4 Canada",BC,49.2820333,-123.1335487,4,"I recently visited La Belle Patate and tried their BBQ Poutine, it was absolutely delicious! The combination of crispy fries, savory gravy, and flavorful BBQ sauce was just perfect. I loved every bite of it!

Apart from the food, the interior decor of the restaurant was also very unique and eye-catching. It gave off a cozy and welcoming vibe, making me feel right at home. I especially loved the wall art and the cozy seating arrangements.

Overall, I would highly recommend La Belle Patate to anyone who loves great food and a cozy ambiance. It's definitely a must-visit spot in town! I'm already planning to come back and try some of their other menu items, and I can't wait to see what other surprises they have in store."

So glad I did, the laidback atmosphere as if you were at home. A small place packed with a friendly and relaxed attitude, but most of all poutine! I got a medium-sized traditional poutine and it was just so incredibly good. Not greasy, not too salty, just perfect! Paired with a light beer, couldn’t ask for more."

La Belle Patate,Fast Food,"1215 Esquimalt Road Victoria, BC V9A 3P1 Canada",BC,48.4300048,-123.4132095,5,"A must for visitors (like us from Colorado) and locals alike. If you want delicious, authentic poutine look no further. Plus, the service was immaculate and the owner is so so friendly ! Definitely try the spruce beer (non-alcoholic, think ginger beer or root beer), and you won’t be disappointed. The poutine is the best and the steamie is a perfect little hot dog with all the toppings. Don’t miss this awesome place !"

I personally enjoy the loaded steamie along with fries & gravy. Make sure you get their in-house made Spruce Beer (a French Canadian pop). So yummy!! The owner has always been so welcoming to us  :)
La Belle Patate,Fast Food,"1215 Esquimalt Road Victoria, BC V9A 3P1 Canada",BC,48.4300048,-123.4132095,5,"I'd been meaning to try this place for longer than I can remember, and upon finally stopping in, I wish I'd done so much sooner.

Having seen La Bella Patate recommended countless times, it lived up to the hype completely. The staff were quite friendly, creating a relaxed atmosphere, and the food was great. I ordered a small classic poutine and a spruce beer (if you're on the fence, try the beer) and look forward to returning in order to try a hotdog next.

Overall this is a very fairly priced and tasty gem in Esquimalt. Solid 10/10."

Burgoo Bistros,Comfort Food,"3096 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5T 3G5 Canada",BC,49.2576435,-123.100815,4,Dinner on a Saturday night. Was surprised that the restaurant was quite empty. Is it that maybe cozy comfort food is not as popular during the hot summer?  We had mixed reviews of the food. Two of us were not excited about our meals (Beef Bourguignon and the Smoked Salmon Salad) whereas the other two loved their dishes (Chicken Parmesan sandwich & Afterschool special).  Our server was great though!  Thank you!
Burgoo Bistros,Comfort Food,"3096 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5T 3G5 Canada",BC,49.2576435,-123.100815,4,Hit it 👍🏿! This is such a Vancouver staple. They have many locations and have been so consistent for years. I like the one on main Street because it has a patio and a good vibe. It definitely can get busy and they do take reservations. So call ahead if you don't want to wait. They should probably advertise this more but they are NUT free kitchen.
Burgoo Bistros,Comfort Food,"3096 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5T 3G5 Canada",BC,49.2576435,-123.100815,5,"For a father's day it wasn't packed until we left. We totally forgot it was father's day... Oops
We showed up at noon and there was a nice cozy both for us all to sit , including a walker.
We ordered the gooey grilled cheese, the jambalaya, and the jerk chicken wings.
All visually pleasing and all very delicious in taste.

Every aspect is thoughtfully designed to ensure an amazing night for your special occasion. From the staff’s behavior to the presentation and flavors of the dishes, everything is top-notch.

You won’t feel rushed to leave the place, allowing you to truly enjoy your dining experience.

The dessert was absolutely amazing and delicious, while the steak was prepared exactly as we requested.

I highly recommend trying this restaurant for a memorable and delightful experience."

Alicia served our table and was so attentive and caring. She asked if there was any occasion, and after learning it was our anniversary brought us complimentary bubbly and dessert to celebrate. Brought a beautiful selection of curated wines to the table to find the best one for us.

We ended up staying for longer than we usually would as each dish was rich, but perfectly balanced and we savoured every bite.

Will be back to explore the menu!"

Elisa,Steakhouses,"1109 Hamilton Street Vancouver, BC V6B 5P6 Canada",BC,49.2759585,-123.1214078,4,"Elisa boasts a modern atmosphere that exudes contemporary charm. One of its standout features is the extensive range of wine selections available to satisfy even the most discerning palate. When it comes to the menu, the tomahawk steak steals the spotlight with its succulent flavors and impressive presentation, leaving a lasting impression on diners. However, while the overall culinary experience at Elisa is commendable, it must be noted that the preparation and execution of other dishes tend to follow more conventional approaches, lacking the same level of innovation and excitement. Nevertheless, the inviting ambiance and the exceptional tomahawk steak make it a worthwhile dining destination."

To my taste, and liking it was easily the best. The atmosphere is wonderful, a small warm, classy dining area filled with jubilant conversations and savory smells. Sparkling water is served complimentary which is a nice touch. The service is intimate and friendly. Now, let me get to the food. Everything they served was absolutely magnificent. It started by taking me for a ride, and each progression of the meal just continued to up the ante. It left me wanting more and only disappointed that it all had to come to an end."

☆ The only dish we really recommend was their honey sorbet dessert (off menu). Great taste with different texture toppings that went perfectly together.

Unfortunately, everything else was too sweet or wasn't the best we ever had.. or lacked flavor."

Honestly I am not a big fan of french food in general but I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food and service was here. I’m normally very picky with the way my dishes are cooked but my first visit was very impressive that I went back and celebrated my birthday here. I will definitely be back again as their menu locates very frequently!

St Lawrence Restaurant,French,"269 Powell Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1G3 Canada",BC,49.2833058,-123.0979713,3,"St. Lawrence has been on my bucket list for a few years now and I was happy to see them win a Michelin star. My husband booked this place for my birthday and it ended up being pretty mediocre food, and then when you factor in the price we paid ($312.50 including a mandatory 20% gratuity that you pay when you reserve, for two people), it was really not great and I would not recommend coming here. The highlights for me were the cod and side stripe shrimp appetizer, the pork rinds, and then foie gras amuse bouche. Everything else was just… okay or not good. The halibut main was dry and on the bland side. The desserts (panna cotta and the raspberry pistachio Mille feuille) were either way too sweet or too bland. Between St Lawrence and Published on Main, I prefer the food at Published. The service was pretty good, they were attentive at removing plates and refilling waters. It was also really nice to sit in front of the chefs at the chefs counter, watching them cook the food. I personally wouldn’t go back here though. Oh and the portion sizes are not great either. My husband left hungry and had to go home and eat other things."

Butter chicken had lots of chicken. Roti canai must have been good as never got a piece. Would have tried deep fried banana but no time
Laksa King,Burmese,"2546 E Hastings Street Vancouver, BC V5K 1Z3 Canada",BC,49.2810252,-123.0533381,4,Haven’t been here since they changed ownership. Nothing changed in terms of decor. The laksa was delicious. It had a nice creamy coconut curry broth. Very flavourful. The Hainan Chicken and Satay Chicken were pretty solid as well. Really wish they could fix their kitchen ventilation though. My hair and clothes smelled like the kitchen after the meal.
Laksa King,Burmese,"2546 E Hastings Street Vancouver, BC V5K 1Z3 Canada",BC,49.2810252,-123.0533381,5,"Had the Laksa, hainan chicken, and roti. Laksa was not too thick and nicely balanced, more on the spicier side but very flavourful. Hainan chicken was nicely marinated and nice flavour, sauce enhances the flavour of the chicken and rice. Roti was a really good appetizer, fluffy and crispy and the sauce added a nice little curry flavour, not too strong."
Laksa King,Burmese,"2546 E Hastings Street Vancouver, BC V5K 1Z3 Canada",BC,49.2810252,-123.0533381,5,"Great food, thicker soup base on the laksa is a preference, but it wasn't runny.   The Pad Thai was the bomb as was the roti.    Atmosphere was the old Frenchie's 60era drive through decor...   So abysmal.    But let's be honest you came for the food."
Laksa King,Burmese,"2546 E Hastings Street Vancouver, BC V5K 1Z3 Canada",BC,49.2810252,-123.0533381,5,"Terima kasih!! Best Laksa I ever had, period.
Dope home cooking style Malaysian food in a take-out style open-plan kitchen setting. This place is super busy and always bustling with locals and is a tribute to how authentic the food is. A great menu with plenty of vegetarian and vegan options or alternatives without sacrificing any of the yum!
We both opted for the traditional Singapore Laksa 新加坡特色叻 which was super yummy, plentifully packed with a large portion and variety of proteins. The broth itself is a perfect balance of coconut and aromatic spices, I actually got mine with the 'spiciest or hottest' modification which was really good and nicely took some of the creamy edge off, however it really wasn't that spicy at all to be honest. I tried my partners which was the default mild and without the extra chilli paste would have been way too creamy for me.
The Fish Cakes (bebola ikan) were phenomenal and worked as a great compliment to the meal! Extremely fresh, home made and no fuss grub with solid ingredients and flavors.
There isn't a lot of Malaysian food around Greater Vancouver, this place is a gem worth heading too. Everything was cooked with awesome precision, presented well and cooked with exciting ingredients and flavors.
Support local businesses!"

Yes, Ramen, like Art, is subjective, but I can't imagine a scenario where a bowl of this could be sent back. Danbo is more consistent than the rain in this fair city for its ability to deliver an all around great bowl of Ramen. If you don't want to quibble about semantics and just have a delicious bowl, accept no substitute. I eat at a variety of Ramen joints, this one just hits every time. No Question."

Hands-down the best vegan ramen I’ve ever had. The customization options are great, the broth is delicious and the service is fast & friendly. Would easily recommend this place (as well as the Seattle location)."
Ramen Danbo,Ramen,"1333 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 2B1 Canada",BC,49.2875039,-123.1289419,5,Truly worth the wait. Incredible. Note the ramen doesn’t come with toppings so you have to add -on everything including egg

The environment and atmosphere were great, and even with a line outside for seating, it did not take long to get in. Highly recommended!"
Ramen Danbo,Ramen,"1833 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 1M4 Canada",BC,49.2682648,-123.1464325,5,"This is one of my favourite place for Vegan Ramen!! As I prefer to have vegetarian/vegan Ramen, its very difficult to find a place that offers multiple options! And Danbo is one of them! Try them out and I am sure it won’t be disappointment for you! I was impressed with its flavourful broth and service! Dining space is quite small but well-managed. Make sure to book a seat via yelp before reaching there.
A must-visit for delicious plant-based options and attentive service."
Ramen Danbo,Ramen,"1833 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 1M4 Canada",BC,49.2682648,-123.1464325,5,"Absolutely some of the best ramen I’ve had in all of Van, and easily top 5 I’ve had outside of Japan itself. The Rekka is a great spicy option, albeit they could still turn up the heat more from extra spicy. The wait can be quite long so don’t expect to just arrive & sit down. But the broth is full & very tasty, the noodles are delicious & I like that they let you pick firmness. The pork chashu is well cut & takes on flavour well. Can’t recommend this place enough."
Ramen Danbo,Ramen,"1833 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 1M4 Canada",BC,49.2682648,-123.1464325,3,"This is one of my favorites spots in Vancouver. The ramen is always on point and I have great memories coming here. However, when we visited on July 11th, our team of 5 had to wait for 2 hours to get inside. What made it worse was that smaller teams who had hardly waited got to go before us. I would have preferred if they had at least asked us first if it would be alright for us to sit separately. A team of four that came after us got to go in before us just because they had one less person. I’m not sure who is managing the queue but the waitlist seemed useless. I would suggest implementing a time limit for bigger groups as two big groups before us took their sweet time while they saw a huge line. What was more infuriating was that when we finally came in, they put together two smaller tables for us and added a stool on the side. I couldn’t help but wonder if they could have done that sooner instead of letting in couples who’d come after us finish their meal and then put the two tables together for us. I’m not sure if I want to come here again as long the customers in line are not treated seriously."
Ramen Danbo,Ramen,"1833 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 1M4 Canada",BC,49.2682648,-123.1464325,5,"Ramen Danbo gets my vote for some of the best ramen in Vancouver. Because there is limited seating inside, there is often a long waitlist to get seated, depending on your group size. Came during the week and for a larger group, there was about a hour long wait to get seated. Once seated the food came out very quickly and the both the ramen and broth was delicious. Love how you can order extra noodles too in case you have extra broth leftover. Prices are very reasonable as well. Will definitely have to come by here again"
Ramen Danbo,Ramen,"1833 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 1M4 Canada",BC,49.2682648,-123.1464325,4,"There’s always a wait so I was intrigued and decided to finally put my name down & try it. Small space inside but it wasn’t stuffy at all. Service is okay, they were really slammed with online orders all the way up to closing time. The ramen was good but I think you could have the same experience somewhere else with less wait."

We were pleased to find that it opened quite late and was conveniently located just a block away from our hotel, Marriott. To our surprise, the food here turned out to be exceptionally good. The service provided went above and beyond our expectations, and the prices seemed reasonable. If you're looking for a great atmosphere, delicious food, and friendly service, this place is the spot to be. I highly recommend trying their chicken dish if you're a fan of spicy flavors; it truly had a wow factor!"

The DanDan noodles and Korean fried chicken are a must try. The noodles were SO flavourful and filling. We got the chicken 2 ways; sweet& spicy and Hanoi glazed. The chef came out and explained which pickled veggies to eat with each flavour and wow. It was so flavourful and tender, the pickled veggies complimented it beautifully, would highly recommend these two flavours. Overall good vibes, great atmosphere, cool decor. Some options to play games by a lounge area in the front too"

Spicy Szechuan Korean Fried Chicken is a must try! Great quantity of food!"

The waiter was very nice and attentive. He even informed us that it would take a little longer for our food to come that day because there was not enough staff in the kitchen.
We ordered Dandan noodles (vegetarian and with chicken). We enjoyed both very much.
We would recommend coming here."

The order was ready in 10 mins on a tuesday night at 10:30. Amazing service, booomb food, the spicy sechuan KFC blew our faces off, but we asked for it!
Pork spring rolls were probably the best we ever had and slaw was great too.

Thank you to the staff that greeted us. Great people!

We will be back!"
Fritz European Fry House,Fast Food,"718 Davie Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 1B6 Canada",BC,49.2773082,-123.1266682,4,Love the place for fresh cut fries.

Poutine with smoked meat ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️: double fried fries which means super crispy fries. My favorite part is them making sure that there are toppings throughout the bowl. Most fry places put everything on the top and then you just have plain soggy fries near the bottom."

Fast, friendly service, and pretty affordable for a lot of value. I actually prefer this little hole in the wall a bit more over another more popular option we tried in the area. This place also layered the poutine so you don't have to mix it, which would've been hard since our cup was piled high. The small poutine was plenty for 2 people as an appetizer or snack.

One minor downside, the tables here aren't the best for eating at (they're low, and maybe only 1-2ft/30-60cm in diameter) so I found it more comfortable to take things to-go. I otherwise appreciated the fun decorations on their wall :)"

Cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. The coleslaw they serve as a side dish was also exceptional with a unique taste that really complemented the fish.

However, I was disappointed with the lack of friendliness from the staff. While the food was great, the service left something to be desired. Also, the seating area was outside only, which may not be ideal for some customers.

Overall, if you're looking for delicious fish and unique coleslaw, Go Fish Restaurant is definitely worth a visit."

My partner got their grilled salmon sandwich and it was epic, just the right seasoning and sauce. My fried halibut was a good portion and perfectly battered. The fries were incredible, but I into the age-old problem of my girlfriend stealing half of them.
Last but not least, the staff were all amazing! The cashier and cooks were the nicest people. Their quality of work proves they care, and I loved their taste in music."

La Taqueria Pinche Taco Shop,Mexican,"322 W Hastings Street Vancouver, BC V8B 1K6 Canada",BC,49.2829621,-123.1105621,3,Price point definitely higher than average. Burrito lacks core flavours critical to Mexican and Latin American cuisine. Meat chunks are a bit dry/hard with the lack of salsa and sour cream. Pico de gallo is barely there. No option for hot sauce. The overall flavour is flat/plain with an overwhelming amount of rice and lack of the rest.

And as always, we were not disappointed. I always like the spaghetti pescatore but decided on the regular spaghetti Bolognese. And the taste was amazing. My wife had another pasta dish which was also very tasty. We invited some friends and they went for the pizza margherita.
To wash it down my wife had red wine and I had an iced tea. The servers were very nice and prompt with the service even though the restaurant was really busy.
We had a good time and definitely will come back to try many other dishes on the menu. I highly recommend la notte for a good meal. The portions are big enough and you can have leftovers for home.
Try La Notte, you won't be disappointed."

I had a long day at work I wanted a nice Italian pizza, I went half meat / half 4 cheese, the cheese was cheap ! The flavours were like any cheap (Costco cheese ) or bulky cheese, greasy and without flavour…
The pizza sauce same 👎🏾 not bueno , it was a $20 pizza and $10 glass of wine, but I was expecting a delicious pizza flavoured tomatoes sauce, the place had live PIANO and I thought, this might be very traditional.
Great for a romantic night , you might wanna try the pastas instead?

Bill$32 and just me , I don’t think I will be back.
☹️
Recommend using better cheese quality, better sauce , more salt, definitely I will
Change the wine glass 🍷 not the ikea kinda  ones (cheap look).
The love piano is greaaaaat!
Keep that!
Keep the great service.
I will google some Italian pizza recipes and will improve my pizza."
La Notte Restaurant,Italian,"3307 Dunbar St Vancouver, BC V6S 2B9 Canada",BC,49.2572246,-123.1853607,5,"Overall, the food was good. Definitely worth it considering the price. The service was good...they gave us so much cheese for the pasta (you really can't complain).

The vibe of the place is cozy. Feels like a family own/run business. Servers are super chill and friendly. Warning, they will joke around with you...so if you got 0 humour, good luck.

They also have specials that aren't on the menu, so it's a surprise each time you go.

What are the cons? In my opinion, it's not a place where I see myself coming often. Mainly because I'm someone who wants to try something new and exciting. Something that is unique. Other reason is because I live 1h drive away.

Do I recommend? Yes! It really helps fills the pasta cravings.

Tip: the food is better eaten fresh at the restaurant and not as takeout."

No issues paying up front, but they ask you for tip when you pay. This is before you even sit down, eat, or have a chance to experience their overall service.

In terms of food, the taste is good. We ordered the Laksa, Nasi Lamak, and Satay.

Service was fine as well, someone came periodically to re-fill our water.

I'd do the dry noodles over the laksa tbh, the fried kuey teow and mee goreng was sooooo good.

the fried fritters are good too but their portions are big so I'd eat those first then eat the mains cause they're easier to pack home, that being said, I did take one of the fritters home to bake cause it was lowkey kinda sogged up from the vinegar sauce (which is so delicious)"

Mee sota was just a chicken soup + noodles, nothing special

Laksa was lacking flavor, the broth is thin like a ramen broth instead of the thick rich coconut curry broth that laksa should have.

I feel like I could have made both dishes at home better.

The restaurant is very small, good for quick meals or ordering takeout. They only accept cash/debit card, or you can pay extra and order pickup through Uber Eats/doordash ($14 CAD). Price is more than I’d expect considering the atmosphere and quality of food"

The restaurant is small and the decor is a bit outdated, but the food is authentic and delicious. I ordered the Laksa, which was flavorful but a bit too spicy for my taste. While I was eating, I didn't realize that there was a small heater right next to me, which made me sweat through my meal. I also ordered some Hainan chicken to go and it was very tasty. The prices here are the cheapest you'll find in Vancouver and the portion sizes are fair. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant for takeout but not for dining in."

The staff are so kind and friendly it’s like you have been invited to their home not their restaurant. One of the best places to have a birthday party. Definitely coming back."

I was sad to skip dessert as menu looked amazing but I had too much food!"
Afghan Horsemen Restaurant,Middle Eastern,"1833 Anderson Street Suite 202 Vancouver, BC V6H 4E5 Canada",BC,49.2693903,-123.1389283,5,"Delicious food with friendly staff. They were really accommodating and explained the menu items for us. It was my first time trying lamb shoulder and it was fabulous. The rice was full of different spices such as cinnamon, turmeric, and cumin with a little sweetness from the carrots and raisins. About the other dish I need to say I usually don’t find vegetarian dishes at restaurants super tasty and it wasn’t an exception. I didn’t like it much. It was good but not for me :)))
Next time I’ll get the lamb shank."

The Platter for Two was sooo filling, definitely can feed at least 3 people!

The portions were really generous. The appetizer of dips, salad, and bread was already quite filling.

The lamb in the platter was so tender and definitely was the highlight for me.

I really appreciate how much variety was included in the platter. Definitely recommend!"

I went in expecting good food, and the first thing you notice is the place has a slick vibe.  When our meals came, just wow - it was all soooooo good.  We repeatedly complimented our meals to the staff, and the staff were very pleasant to chat with as they served our meals and checked in on us.

This place is worth the short walk from Granville Island if you are hungry and want a great meal!"

I was super lucky to show up on a quiet weekday evening, I was seated immediately and greeted by a really friendly guy. We picked a drink and made the order, that was brought to the table almost immediately. I am not a chicken person but this is a whole different level. The broth is so flavorful, yet so delicate and light. The pork was perfection, as well as the egg! The noodles had the perfect consistency and texture. All in all, a great dish, paired with a great store-branded pale ale on draft. Really really recommended!"
Maruhachi Ra-men,Ramen,"780 Bidwell Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2J6 Canada",BC,49.2905702,-123.1333439,5,"The vegetarian ramen was incredible. It’s the exact type of comfort food you’d want to eat on a rainy day. I usually cannot finish a full bowl of ramen by myself, but maybe it was the thin noodles or the light broth, I happily finished my entire bowl without feeling stuffed. Although there was a lineup even during midday on a Monday, the service was fast & servers were friendly."
Maruhachi Ra-men,Ramen,"780 Bidwell Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2J6 Canada",BC,49.2905702,-123.1333439,5,"My ramen knowledge is still developing but I can attest that the broth was silky smooth with rich flavor, the chilli pepper paste was fresh and aromatic and the noodles did not absorb much of the flavor, as another reviewer indicates. The pork was also fresh, even though very thinly cut, bur surely very tasty. The egg was the best I ever had in taste, texture and color, more like an ember color in the yolk. I would visit again."
Maruhachi Ra-men,Ramen,"780 Bidwell Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2J6 Canada",BC,49.2905702,-123.1333439,5,"This place is tied for my favorite ramen in all of Vancouver. Their ingredients are always simple and fresh with consistently good results (and no MSG, even more impressive). Service is always efficient since they’re used to long line-ups. Their ramen egg is a must-try—so delicious and a cut above the usual ramen egg.

I recommend the Chashu-Tamago ramen/classic Tamago ramen, and definitely add an egg to your order if there isn’t one!"
Maruhachi Ra-men,Ramen,"780 Bidwell Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2J6 Canada",BC,49.2905702,-123.1333439,5,"Maruhachi Ramen offers a unique twist on traditional Japanese ramen with their chicken-based soup. While most ramen places use pork-based broth, Maruhachi's broth is made with chicken, resulting in a rich and flavorful white creamy broth that will leave you amazed. They also offer the option to add extra noodles for just $2, making it a great value. Along with their delicious ramen, their selection of beer is also worth trying. Don't miss out on this incredible chicken-based ramen experience!"

We ended up going during happy hour for a quick pre dinner snack and drink! We were not expecting much but we were blown away by the food and customer service! We ordered the dip platter and it was so so good, it came with a lot of pita for dipping. The spanakopita was delicious and freshly made! Definitely will be returning to try out their dessert :)"
The Greek By Anatoli,Greek,"1043 Mainland Street Vancouver, BC V6B Canada",BC,49.2762132,-123.1198874,5,"First time Customer alert ⚠️ 📢
My boyfriend took me here for Valentine Day and I loved it!!
I LOVE GREEK FOOD, so I'm going to be picky.

Pro:
- Atmosphere is very nice, and the music and vibe definitely set the tone.
- During valentine they had red roses in front, which was very nice 🌹
- The music was bumpin and definitely was a chill vibe. 🎶
-  The light bulbs is a nice touch to the restaurant. 💡
- The structure of the restaurant was built well. I was able to hear my partner perfectly fine even with the music louder than usual.
- The table placement was what I enjoyed. It was separated well that it didn't seem to be close to anybody. 👌🙆‍♀️🙆‍♂️

Food/Service:
- Had the Lamb Platter and Side of Calamari.
- The Lamb platter looked small but after awhile it does fill you up.
- For 2 people and a side is sufficient to make you quite stuffed.
- The Lamb fell off the bone and was well seasoned around.
- Waitress was super friendly and nice! She personality made it easier to pick dishes and small champagne wine to celebrate the occasion !

Improvements:
- The overall dishes from Calamari to Lamb Plattter had too much lemon and same with the tzakiki. A bit less would of been better."
The Greek By Anatoli,Greek,"1043 Mainland Street Vancouver, BC V6B Canada",BC,49.2762132,-123.1198874,1,"**ordered through Uber eats** ordered a salad from this restaurant, paid 20 CAD and received a very small salad, you can hold it in your palm. Not worth the money paid. The box is 2/3 full. Shame as we dined at this restaurant and our salad was a lot bigger."
The Greek By Anatoli,Greek,"1043 Mainland Street Vancouver, BC V6B Canada",BC,49.2762132,-123.1198874,2,"I had such high expectations for this place. I love greek food and go out for greek often, but this place left me very disappointed and unimpressed.

My friend and I had a lunch reservation. Upon entering the restaurant, we waited over 5 minutes before someone even acknowledged our presence, mind you, they weren't even busy.

We sat down and ordered the Calamari to start, then the Country Lamb for me, and the Pork and Chicken Thigh Souvlaki for my friend.

The Calamari was really plain (I wouldn't recommend), my friend said her Souvlaki was well-seasoned and enjoyable. My lamb was cooked well, but they didn't have any mint sauce or mint jelly to go with my lamb, which I was surprised and heavily disappointed by.

Overall the food was mediocre.

The food was a 3/5, but the experience was a 2/5.
Would maybe be willing to give this place another try for dinner or at its Gastown location."
The Greek By Anatoli,Greek,"1043 Mainland Street Vancouver, BC V6B Canada",BC,49.2762132,-123.1198874,5,"A sunny, unfortunately windy soon-after, typical Vancouver, day out on the patio had a great time catching up with a friend while enjoying awesome Greek food and awesome service.

If you want to skip the menu and know what to order like a pro, saganaki, lamb chops, calamari.
You are welcome."
Nuba in Gastown,Mediterranean,"207 W Hastings Street Vancouver, BC V6B 1K6 Canada",BC,49.2829632,-123.1096299,4,Got the mixed grill and cold platters and both were excellent. Best Lebanese cuisine I’ve had in Vancouver so far. The hummus was great and the grilled meats were excellent. It would have been a bit better if they had more than just cauliflower as the only vegetable in the mixed grill platter although it was a meat focused dish.

The atmosphere was very cozy.
Service was not bad.
We went at 4pm, so we were bummed to know we can only order from their lunch and drink menu. Dinner is at 5pm!

We ordered:
Baba Ghanouj - eggplant dip with pita bread
> Not bad. Tasted very fresh. Wished it was seasoned more.

Mezze grilled sampler(min 2 person pay per person) - sample of their meats, shrimp, sauces, and dips
> recommend! Great grill flavor. All the sauces were super flavorful. The protein was great. The grilled vegetables were my favorite. This isn't enough food for two people. Definitely order more!

Total (+18%tip) : +$90
Parking : +$12 (1.5hrs)"
Nuba in Gastown,Mediterranean,"207 W Hastings Street Vancouver, BC V6B 1K6 Canada",BC,49.2829632,-123.1096299,4,I ordered the lunch pate with chicken shish tawok and it was delicious. I loved the garlic sauce. Just wished the pita was made fresh or at least not so dry.

We scraped up every last bit off of the plate. It was the perfect amount of each item, I can’t even say what my favourite item was in the sampler because everything was equally tasty. If you haven’t been here before, I think the sampler was the way to go for sure."
Bodega On Main,Spanish,"1014 Main Street Vancouver, BC V6A 2W1 Canada",BC,49.2754689,-123.0994804,4,"Delicious food and drinks! We had the Octopus and Short Ribs. Took a star off because our octopus was way smaller of a portion than in other photos. Portion didn’t match the price
Highly recommend both of those!
Paella was also delicious.
Great and quick service!"
Bodega On Main,Spanish,"1014 Main Street Vancouver, BC V6A 2W1 Canada",BC,49.2754689,-123.0994804,3,"The food and their vibe were very good. We enjoyed our time there. However unfortunately, my friend ordered a non-alcoholic drink since she can't drink alcohol, but the drink WAS alcoholic. After the first sip, she thought it had some alcohol, so we even checked with the waitress, and they said it was unseen non-alcoholic, but after a few minutes, her face started getting very red and she started feeling very dizzy. After telling the waitress about the symptoms, she admitted that one ingredient in the ""non-alcoholic drink"" contains a little bit alcohol. I really don't think any alcohol should be in the ""non-alcoholic drink""😑
When a customer orders a non-alcoholic drink, I truly hope they double-check that the drink is non-alcoholic drink since some people simply cannot take it at all.

But again, other than this particular incident, everything was great!"

Bodega On Main,Spanish,"1014 Main Street Vancouver, BC V6A 2W1 Canada",BC,49.2754689,-123.0994804,4,"It is quite a decent Spanish restaurant.
I have personally never been to Spain, so I can't comment about the authenticity, but their foods are so delicious. Overall, food menus are a little bit expensive considering the amount of food, but I liked them.
Paellas are a little salty, but if you have them with other foods like fried eggplants or beef tongue, they go really well together. You would not regret it.
It was my second visit and my first time to experience downstairs. It was somewhat more private, but it seemed like I was in a tavern or something even though the bar was upstairs.
All in all, it is always fun to dine here, as we could laugh at each other watching lips colored with squid ink paella."
Bodega On Main,Spanish,"1014 Main Street Vancouver, BC V6A 2W1 Canada",BC,49.2754689,-123.0994804,5,"We ordered mixed paella, garlic prawns, fried mushrooms, beef tongue, and sangria that day. All the dishes were delicious. I especially liked the beef tongue. It was tender and seasoned really well. Seafoods in the paella were large in size and number. Servers were pretty nice, and the restaurant had great atmosphere. Overall it was a wonderful experience having lunch here."

We loved the food there, the service was quick, food was decently priced, and quite authentic. I had enchiladas for the first time here, it was delicious. The tortilla was crispy, and the cheese held the tortillas together quite well! However, I must say that it’s a heavy meal! I personally couldn’t eat this regularly, but for times when I crave Mexican flavours, I am totally down to come back again!"

I’m from California and miss authentic Mexican food from back home. This place is the real deal and brought me back to my old neighbourhood restaurants in the Mission. We had the chips and salsa, the tacos WITH CHEESE!, and a chimichanga. All were so, so yummy and very filling. Price is right, staff was lovely, flavours on point. Definitely give it a try!"
The Mexican Antojitos Y Cantina,Mexican,"1049 Granville Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 1L4 Canada",BC,49.2787855,-123.1240318,4,It was overall a great place for some delicious Mexican food.

I tried the beef tongue tacos for the first time. It is hot, tender and delicious!

Mott 32,Chinese,"1161 W Georgia Street Vancouver, BC V6E 0C6 Canada",BC,49.2867693,-123.124256,4,"Lovely ambience and a good overall experience. The smoked black cod and the frog legs were the standout dishes overall and definitely would recommend ordering them if you go. The Peking duck was okay overall; I expected something a bit more special for the price point and experience, but it was still good. Would consider going back in the future to try a different variety of dishes as the standouts above were wonderful."
Mott 32,Chinese,"1161 W Georgia Street Vancouver, BC V6E 0C6 Canada",BC,49.2867693,-123.124256,5,It was our last restaurant that we visited in Vancouver. You get Asian food on a high level.

Mott 32,Chinese,"1161 W Georgia Street Vancouver, BC V6E 0C6 Canada",BC,49.2867693,-123.124256,4,"Mott 32 was quite atmospheric with their old Shanghai style interior design, playing up their posh and boujee feel. Didn't have a chance to try their duck as you will need to reserve a duck the day before dining. Their dishes were, of course, definitely on the pricey side but nonetheless tasty and flavourful. Would recommend their short rib and their signature lobster fried rice. The style is more fusion in my opinion, not quite the traditional Chinese taste."
Mott 32,Chinese,"1161 W Georgia Street Vancouver, BC V6E 0C6 Canada",BC,49.2867693,-123.124256,4,"A group of 6 of us had dinner here recently and we received very good service from the wait staff to the sous chef who carved up our Peking Duck dish.

This restaurant is right beside the Paradox Hotel entrance, formerly the Trump Hotel for this who do not know the West Georgia address of the place.

I will say this is one of the most expensive dim sum dishes restaurants in Vancouver. We were going to try some dishes but let's put it this way I know Maine Lobster is expensive, but $32 for a so gle piece of Maine lobster Siu Mai?

We also had the smoked black cod, crispy rice with dried prawns in soup, beef and flat noodles, Stir fried broccoli with tofu, and a free range chicken dish. I would say the dinner was good with the Signature Smoked black cod being the best dish even ahead of the Peking duck.

Was plenty of room at the table to sit and they had an okay selection of cocktails and wines.

Nice to try for a holiday dinner."

The interior is tastefully decorated, creating an inviting ambiance. Must-tries include the garlicky beans, flaky roti, and succulent beef satay.

We had the 12 course dinner tonight (minimum 2 people) and it was $59 per person. There was an option for 9 course meal for $49, but we decided to go for the bigger portion because we skipped lunch.

It included: papaya mango salad (with peanuts), roti cani with a dip, three satay chicken skewers, three deep fried whole oysters with a dip, a bowl of steamed mussels, three scallops (cooked to perfect), shrimp/mango/tomato/bell pepper stir fry, three lobster tails, deep fried fish, green beans with shrimp, beef rendang, and lastly their delicious deep fried banana with vanilla ice cream.

Seafood was fresh and the portion between three people was perfect! The rendang was slightly dry, but still edible. They still have the plexiglass in between each party which is great to see that they are still being cautious.

Great service and attentive servers. Thank you for this experience!"
Burger Crush,Burgers,"755 Nelson Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 1V3 Canada",BC,49.2797631,-123.1234938,5,"Five stars for you Burger Crush! Well done!

Burger Crush has a simple menu with veg options and both non and alcoholic beverages. Prices were higher than the Golden Arches or competitors but reasonable given the quality and service.

I went with the single patty cheeseburger and fries. Delicious burgers, delicious fries. Perfectly messy. Perfectly cooked burger and fries. Excellent.

Presentation was above what you’d expect from a burger place. Washrooms were clean, accessible and gender neutral. Dining area was frequently cleaned by staff as soon as people were finished and leaving.

I have no complaints and no areas to offer improvements, however, I did visit at 2:00pm on a Friday, your experience may differ depending on timing!

Enjoy!"

Tried the vegan cheese burger and the beef cheeseburger. I was surprised at just how amazing they both were. The vegan one is easily the best vegan burger in town. The cheesy fries were also really good. Won’t be long till I come back again.

So decided to check it out. Overall a pretty decent burger. I did like the fries. Maybe i should have got a milk shake. Although the burger was decent, it didn't reach a standard such as a in and out or shake Shack! Just saying. But I i did love the fries. Crispy and thinly sliced. Good with your burger."

The first few bites of the burger and poutine are great, and then the cheese sauce just gets to be too much. For the price I paid, it’s not worth it. I would suggest going to Juicy Joe’s over Burger Crush."

My husband got a regular milkshake and I tried them both, vegan was definitely better as it was a bit less thick and easier to drink. My lactose-intolerant butt appreciates it. I got my burger lettuce wrapped too and I enjoyed every bite! Great service and prompt. Arrived at about 5:30pm on a Wednesday. Will definitely come back"

Their sweet and sour fish was cooked to perfection. Fish tastes fresh, juicy and delicious. The sauce was the perfect balance of sweet, tangy and savoury. Vegetables were not over cooked.

We ordered the combo for two and it was worth it! The deep fried squid was delicious. Crispy on the outside but tender on the inside.  This combo came with a  few side dishes, pork intestine, cucumber, and pigs ears.

We will have to come back next time to try other dishes like shaved ice, braised beef and more.

Amazing customer service too! Very friendly and attentive staff."
Micha,Chinese,"120-4751 Garden City Road Richmond, BC V6X 3M7 Canada",BC,49.1778683,-123.1255409,4,"I think your experience here depends on what you order as some of their food is hit or miss. I absolutely love their “nuggets”, which are essentially Taiwanese popcorn chicken and honestly some of the best I’ve had. It’s super crunchy and sliced thing, would definitely recommend. The braised pork ear and the sweet and sour fried fish are also super delicious, not too much breading, perfect texture and amount of sauce.
I do not recommend their soup, it had that pork intestine flavour to it that I really did not love. Their Thai chicken is great in terms of how it’s cooked, but I did not like the flavour.
Place is clean and service was good, menu was a tad confusing. But overall, I would come back again."

Very limited selections on the menu. Ran out of pearls 3 in the afternoon. Very disappointed. My spicy noodle was not spicy at all. The flavour was very good though! Overall we were happy with our lunch."

The server is knowledgeable and friendly, reservation is required because they only open for dinner. The table for six is kind of tight, otherwise everything is great. Will return. Recommended"
Osteria Savio Volpe,Italian,"615 Kingsway Vancouver, BC V5T 3K5 Canada",BC,49.2574425,-123.0909434,5,"A wonderful dining experience with delicious food, great service and a buzzing atmosphere. We did the family style menu which was picked by the chefs based on a few questions. It was perfect and so much food; plenty of value. We celebrated a birthday and we had a complimentary glass of champagne ready for us when we arrived plus a cute birthday dessert. Highly recommend."
Osteria Savio Volpe,Italian,"615 Kingsway Vancouver, BC V5T 3K5 Canada",BC,49.2574425,-123.0909434,5,"I reserved a single seat at the bar reservation for 5:00 p.m.  I was quite fortunate to be given a seat on the patio because the restaurant wasn't that busy; it was a serene and beautiful setting!  Along with passing out the standard menus, the waitress read out the day's specials.

I selected the lemony tortellini from the normal menu, along with the featured arugula salad.  I also had a glass of water for starters.  Together, the food was delicious, and the serving sizes were perfect.  Additionally, the waitress was cordial, attentive, and made sure my service experience was excellent.

I had a wonderful, exceptional eating experience, which much improved my evening after a difficult birthday night the day before.  I'd love to revisit Savio Volpe to try their Alla Famiglia and/or their green spaghetti sometime."

Recieved way more food than we expected and everything was great. Service was excellent. The pork and polenta were definitely the highlights. We also all loved our server and randomly shared dog photos with him."
Osteria Savio Volpe,Italian,"615 Kingsway Vancouver, BC V5T 3K5 Canada",BC,49.2574425,-123.0909434,5,"My family and I are from out of town and booked our table a few months in advance. We had heard it was amazing and it 100% lived up to the hype.

We did the tasting menu for our table of 4. The food just kept coming! We were shocked to have so much food continuously come to the table. It was my first time trying a few of them items served and they exceeded expectations.

For $79 you definitely get your bang for buck and a wonderful experience! The wait staff was also fantastic. As soon as you took a sip of water, someone was there to refill it. Cleared and wiped tables between courses too!

We will be back!"
Nook,Italian,"1525 Yew Street Vancouver, BC V6K 3E4 Canada",BC,49.2722315,-123.155229,5,"The pizza was incredible! The flavors were amazing and the dough was soft and crunchy where it needed to be. We got the mushroom pizza and Cacio Pepe pasta to share.

The pasta was a bit disappointing in my opinion: too salty and not flavorful other than a lot of pepper corn they added.

Overall, I recommend this place for pizzas and a few drinks!"

Food: 10/10. Ambience: cool classy jazzy. Staff: awesome, fun, lovely, quirky (or maybe it’s a Vancouver thing because everyone here is kinda fun, and I feel spoiled coming from the east coast). Either way, love this place."

The person serving was good fun, up for a laugh. The food was amazing, I had pasta conarelli cacao pepe which had a tower of cheese. My husband had a vegetarian pizza. There was so much pasta I had to take some home (tomorrow’s lunch) and they gave us a complimentary coffee cake desert, which was so kind! I will definitely be returning. And the wine was also excellent"

Brix & Mortar,Wine Bars,"1137 Hamilton Street Vancouver, BC V6B 5P6 Canada",BC,49.2756123,-123.1219105,5,"Having worked there many times, I can confidently say that it is a great place to hold such an important event as a wedding. The venue boasts of unique architectural details and character that adds to the ambiance of the occasion.

One of the standout features of this venue is the friendly and helpful staff. They are always on hand to offer assistance and ensure that everything runs smoothly. The location is also fantastic, with close proximity to a waterfront and green spaces that provide excellent opportunities for a photo session.

And of course, the food is simply amazing. From the pan-seared scallops to the fresh fruit sorbet, everything on the menu is a delight to the taste buds. These dishes are among my personal favorites and are sure to impress even the most discerning palates.

Overall, I highly recommend this venue for anyone looking to host a wedding. The combination of stunning architecture, excellent service, picturesque location, and delectable cuisine makes it a standout choice that is sure to leave a lasting impression on all who attend."

We were lucky to sit in the courtyard on the second floor, just like having a date in a beautiful garden. As for the food, we ordered shrimp and fried cauliflower salad for appetizers, and they were both stunning. The flavors were rich and delightful. The steak and chicken for the main course maintained the high standards of a great restaurant"
Brix & Mortar,Wine Bars,"1137 Hamilton Street Vancouver, BC V6B 5P6 Canada",BC,49.2756123,-123.1219105,5,"Went here few days ago for my birthday. Staff were super friendly and nice, the food was perfect (we had steak, and it was one the best steaks I've had).

One thing that I didn't like was the fact that I was expecting a dessert with happy birthday on it, but that didn't happen lol. Also, the atmosphere is not what we see in the pictures, way smaller. But I would still go back :)"
Brix & Mortar,Wine Bars,"1137 Hamilton Street Vancouver, BC V6B 5P6 Canada",BC,49.2756123,-123.1219105,1,"Wanted to really like this place what with the nice reviews and photos of the restaurant.  Below are things that left a bad taste in the mouth:
1.  Made reservations online weeks ago, and when we get there we get a high top table when there was a booth spot.  Hostess made the change after I made a request.
2.  Server was pushing the special and adding lobster tails at every interaction.  She was pretty aggressive with her recommendations as if she gets commission for every lobster tail that gets ordered. When we wanted to share entrees and app, that's when the level of service really decreased.  She barely came by after taking our order, and I think we waited over half an hr before the food came.  The restaurant was not busy, so not sure what took so long for the food and there was no reassurance from her food was coming.
3.  The food was ok...the 22oz. steak we shared was bland and the server said the chef recommends having it ""medium"", but there were parts of it that were rare.  The lobster tails were bland and doesn't look appetizing.

Honestly, I shouldn't have given her the 18% gratuity (that's the 1st button on the keypad), but I was there with girlfriends for a Bachelorette party.  It took so long to get our food we didn't even get a chance to order dessert, bc we had reservations for drinks somewhere else.

The ambience is nice, but no I would not come back here again - OVERRATED."
Brix & Mortar,Wine Bars,"1137 Hamilton Street Vancouver, BC V6B 5P6 Canada",BC,49.2756123,-123.1219105,5,"Brix and Mortar is a restaurant that offers a memorable culinary adventure, leaving a lasting impression on its guests. My dining experience at this establishment was a combination of impressive highlights and a few areas that could be improved upon.

The ambiance at Brix and Mortar is undeniably charming. The interior design exudes elegance and sophistication, creating a welcoming atmosphere.

The service provided by the staff (Savannah?) was attentive and courteous, ensuring that our needs were met throughout the evening. The servers were knowledgeable about the menu and offered insightful suggestions.

However, there was a moment when I informed the waiter of a small hair on the ramen egg of the Ahi Tuna Salad (I think you can see it on the picture). Since I have already split the salad with my family members, I wasn't expecting anything other than a follow up. The waiter said ""let me check with the kitchen"", took away the egg, and never came back with an apology or any follow up.

The menu at Brix and Mortar offers a diverse range of dishes, showcasing the creativity and skill of the culinary team. We ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad, Burrata Di Puglia, Wild Sockeye Salmon, Lamb Neck, and Steak. The flavors were generally well-balanced, and the presentation was visually appealing. All the dishes were exceptional aside from the Steak, which was satisfactory, but not outstanding. The cocktails we ordered (Stregarita, Sakura Blossom, and Basil Exposition) were delicious as well.

Overall, Brix and Mortar is a restaurant that offers a memorable dining experience with its refined ambiance, attentive service, and creative menu. Although there were a few minor areas for improvement, the overall experience was enjoyable and left a positive impression.

Les Faux Bourgeois,French,"663 E 15th Avenue Vancouver, BC V5T 2R6 Canada",BC,49.2573233,-123.0896351,5,"Food was good. Very fairly priced for a Vancouver restaurant. Nice classic French bistro menu and vibes.

Hostess was nice, we made a mistake with our reservation but luckily was able to fix it and have us seated. Our server, Dave, was very friendly and helpful through the service.

Squid was very super tender and tasty.

Duck Confit was pretty good, the goat cheese salad under was great and was a very generous portion.

Hanger steak and frites was nice. I prefer the mustard butter over the red wine jus. Very generous portion of fries too.

Would come back to try more."
Les Faux Bourgeois,French,"663 E 15th Avenue Vancouver, BC V5T 2R6 Canada",BC,49.2573233,-123.0896351,4,"Excellent service. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. However the dishes tasted pretty standard. Actually the beef tartare was a bit disappointing. It was mixed in with so much spice and sauce that you could hardly taste the beef at all. Made you wonder the quality of the beef itself. The dining room was too hot/stuffy, I was pretty much sweating by the end of the meal. I would suggest not to come in the summer especially before 8pm"
Les Faux Bourgeois,French,"663 E 15th Avenue Vancouver, BC V5T 2R6 Canada",BC,49.2573233,-123.0896351,3,the beef tartare was good. i don’t recommend the charcuterie board unless you can appreciate a bitter taste (there is no fig jam). its prices were pretty good for a french restaurant - you get what you pay for. the steak was tender but i personally think it should’ve been served with mashed potatoes to complement the steak. there are better restaurants.
Les Faux Bourgeois,French,"663 E 15th Avenue Vancouver, BC V5T 2R6 Canada",BC,49.2573233,-123.0896351,5,"Delicious! Good service and wonderful food. Fairly reasonably priced as well, for these economic times. The grilled squid was fabulous and super tender."
Les Faux Bourgeois,French,"663 E 15th Avenue Vancouver, BC V5T 2R6 Canada",BC,49.2573233,-123.0896351,4,"We came here as a walk-in at 8pm on Saturday. The reservations were full until 9:45 so we decided to risk it. Thankfully we were seated right away! It looks like the bar is reserved for walk-in guests.

The ambiance of the place was lovely with dim lighting. I really enjoyed the music (jazz?).

Everything was delicious. The only complaint was that the entrée took an hour to get to our table after our appetizers.

For starters, we got the Onion Soup and the Beef Tartare. The portions were quite large, almost equivalent to our entrées. We really enjoyed both of them.

It was my first time having a Coq Au Vin so I was excited. Although I didn’t enjoy it very much. I don’t think it was a problem with the restaurant, maybe just not a fan of the dish itself.

The steak was cooked perfectly according to our preference and it was delicious.

All-in-all a lovely and romantic place for date night. I would definitely come back!"

Hong style cafe food that was delicious and served quickly. As to substitute carbs for vegetables and was very happy with the portion and taste. The Hong Kong style coffee was perfect and the lunch deal was filling. Certainly be back and try more food as these types of restaurants are getting rare."

Sopra Sotto,Pizza,"1510 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5L 2Y7 Canada",BC,49.2711706,-123.0693309,4,"I booked Sopra Sotto for a family dinner because it was on the same block as my favourite ice cream place, and it was a great choice! Only the cocktails were really pricey, all other items were an expected price for the area and cuisine. Atmosphere was nice with the patio and natural lightning and decorations. Service was alright, a little slow and absent sometimes. We tried everything from drinks, appetizer board, pizzas, pastas, cartoccio on special. The pizza and board were the highlights in my opinion, I would recommend those in your next visit."

The host let us choose our table and brought us water right away. We ordered the meatballs that came with focaccia bread that was so perfect we had to order more. We got Caesar salad and the Diavola pizza. Everything was tasty.
Also the environment is just so much more comfortable than all of the other Italian restaurants I’ve been to in the city. Everything felt bright and clean and modern."
Sopra Sotto,Pizza,"1510 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5L 2Y7 Canada",BC,49.2711706,-123.0693309,3,"A great location for a modern Italian restaurant with a wood fire oven!

The space is clean and open and aromatic. On Sundays they have live piano music with a pianist named Bruno.

The low star ratings is due to the fact that I am a little disappointed in their food.

We ordered a focaccia but it was more like pizza crust in that it was thin, very hard and chewy instead of thick and soft. Usually focaccia is a dimpled, soft bread with Italian seasonings, similar to pizza bread. We also ordered the pizza and it had what seemed like the same bread base as the ""focaccia"". /:

The tagliatelle ragu is a little bland.

The eggplant and homemade sausage Margarita Pizza wasn't that good... The eggplant didn't lend any interesting depth or flavor. I wish the sausage was more spiced!

I tried the chili oil and it's not spicy, just oil, to me.

The best dish was the truffled mushroom pasta."

Definitely give it a try and enjoy!

Sopra Sotto,Pizza,"1510 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5L 2Y7 Canada",BC,49.2711706,-123.0693309,5,"Everything was excellent. Gabriel service was great, he was super nice,  he took the time to give us recommendations and to accomodate for my mother's allergies. The pizza and pasta we ordered were amazing and they came very fast.
We sat next to the kitchen bar and it was a very good experience. We got to see how Jose and Rodrigo prepared our dishes to perfection. We got to talk with Rodrigo and Jose and they are super nice people.
Definitely recommend!"
Kissa Tanto,Japanese,"263 E Pender Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1T8 Canada",BC,49.2806222,-123.09812,4,"Absolutely a wonderful tasting experience. The combinations of flavours were exactly right. The fish tasted very fresh and the sauce on top puts the whole dish together. The highlight is definitely the truffle omelette— the most perfect omelette I’ve ever had in my life. The truffle was aromatic, paired with creamy eggs. I just felt that my table was a bit squishy and the table felt very full."
Kissa Tanto,Japanese,"263 E Pender Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1T8 Canada",BC,49.2806222,-123.09812,5,"Good food with amazing service. Everything was done perfectly and there was nothing that we didn't like. Went with the omikaze and the recommended sweet spot for pricing of approximately $170 - $200pp. We weren't too hungry so the waiter went more for higher quality food rather than quantity. The waitress asked a series of questions in order to tailor the menu to us a little which was nice.

You'll want to make a reservation if you want a better chance at getting a seat. Walk-ins are possible but fill up quick. Paid street parking is available and relatively cheap (couple of dollars for the 2-3h duration we were there).

Definitely a nice experience and worth trying at least once if you get the chance, but it is quite pricey. For the total price you could eat at a few nice restaurants instead, but life's short and you can't take your money with you so as long as the wife is happy, you'll be happy."
Kissa Tanto,Japanese,"263 E Pender Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1T8 Canada",BC,49.2806222,-123.09812,4,"Loved Kissa Tanto since they opened, really happy to see them receive a Michelin star, though that does mean prices have gone up a bunch. (Corkage is now $75 and the truffle omelette was nearly $80). All that said, food is still excellent. Flavors were well balanced and fun. Would definitely keep coming back.

Atmosphere-wise, the restaurant itself is a bit loud and the solo chairs can be a bit uncomfortable."
Kissa Tanto,Japanese,"263 E Pender Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1T8 Canada",BC,49.2806222,-123.09812,5,"Haven’t been back since they had the ‘miso bread’.  To my dismay this dish is cancelled which to be honest was the only dish I remembered from my last meal here.

Service was exceptional, and every dish was a delight except I would skip the rib eye.   Nothing wrong but for the price / taste my preference would be either Elisa or Victor and prepared traditionally."
Kissa Tanto,Japanese,"263 E Pender Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1T8 Canada",BC,49.2806222,-123.09812,3,"While I recognize that my three-star rating may seem low for such an extraordinary restaurant, the most important factor for me is value for money. As a Michelin-starred restaurant, I expected an extraordinary experience, but what I received was a decent restaurant, albeit a bit too noisy, with good service and okay food. Nothing was particularly extraordinary, except for the price. We ordered the entire menu, and while the octopus dish and spaghetti were incredible masterpieces, the rest was just passable.

To sum it up, the food is good, but it neither deserves its price nor its Michelin star."
PiDGiN,Japanese,"350 Carrall Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2J3 Canada",BC,49.281881,-123.104145,5,First time I tried a tasting menu and it did not disappoint. We tried the regular tasting menu for a birthday celebration. I forgot the name of the food but it was divine. Definitely will try the chef’s station tasting menu for another experience.

The service surpassed our expectations. Our server, Jordan, was not only incredibly knowledgeable but also engaging and delightful to converse with. If you are in the area, worth checking it out although would be mindful of walking down Hastings Street which felt very uncomfortable to walk down given the crowd."

PiDGiN,Japanese,"350 Carrall Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2J3 Canada",BC,49.281881,-123.104145,5,"It’s a Michelin recommended restaurant and it’s easy to see why. It’s a great fusion of Asian and western cuisine and all the dishes were carefully curated.

We had the tasting menu and a virgin cocktail and it’s not for a full meal - it’s only to highlight the dishes and the restaurant.

If you order separate dishes, I highly recommend the scallop and bison dish! It can be a bit pricy but I think it’s worth the price and the wait based on my experience."
Sura Korean Cuisine,Korean,"1518 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 1C3 Canada",BC,49.2888512,-123.1316371,5,"I enjoyed the food here with my family 😊 portions are good. I just wish they could have more non spicy food for kids. They do charge a 15% service fee if your group has more than 6 people, which is like a tip, so it is reasonable."
Sura Korean Cuisine,Korean,"1518 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 1C3 Canada",BC,49.2888512,-123.1316371,5,"At SURA Korean Restaurant, one can anticipate a truly unique dining experience that perfectly melds traditional Korean flavors with a modern, sophisticated ambiance. From the moment you walk in, the welcoming atmosphere, resplendent with warm lights and comfortable seating, sets the tone for an excellent culinary journey.

The menu at SURA is a vibrant palette of Korean gastronomy, showcasing the rich, hearty flavors that the cuisine is known for. The Bulgogi, tender and succulently marinated, is an absolute must-try, as is the Bibimbap, served in a hot stone bowl, which creates an irresistible crispy rice layer at the bottom. The seafood pancake, brimming with fresh ingredients, is an ideal start to the meal.

Vegetarians and vegans aren’t left out either. SURA’s Japchae, a dish of stir-fried sweet potato noodles and vegetables, is an example of their commitment to catering to diverse dietary needs without compromising flavor.

One aspect that particularly stands out is the quality of their ingredients. The freshness of the vegetables, the quality of the meats, and the aromatic spices, all come together in a symphony of flavors that leaves one yearning for more.

Service at SURA matches the high standard set by their food. The staff is attentive, helpful with suggestions, and ensures a smooth dining experience.

In addition, the restaurant’s adherence to safety and hygiene protocols in these challenging times further enhances the overall experience, making you feel safe and comfortable.

Overall, SURA Korean Restaurant in Vancouver is a destination not just for those with a palate for Korean food but anyone who appreciates good food, well served. Highly recommended!"

We found a parking lot for $3 / hr across the back door in the street behind the restaurant. They have 4 free spots behind the back door but they were full.

We get the lunch set menu and got to try different things, all of which were good. Kids got a dumpling soup and kimchi fried rice. Portions were just right to fill us up."

The only thing to consider is they don’t take reservations and there is usually a wait list at this place.
Overall a “must try” for Korean food in Vancouver."
Sura Korean Cuisine,Korean,"1518 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 1C3 Canada",BC,49.2888512,-123.1316371,5,"What a great place on Robson St for authentic Korean eats!

We actually tried coming here before but the line-up was too long of a wait. Fortunately we came again during foul weather earlier this month (December 2021) & yay, we got a table without delay. Had to call the restaurant to let them someone know we were outside, as patrons are required to stay outside until a staff member came out to assist. I appreciate the covid protocol (they do check for vax i.ds).

Their great ratings do not lie - the food is comforting and delicious. Portions are good considering the cost. The decor is light and minimal. Their staff are all excellent in friendliness, attentiveness and speed.

The potato pancakes had perfect crisp to it and were very flavourful on their own ~ no sauce really needed. The vegetarian japchae was so satisfying, that we didn’t even miss the meat.

I loved the grilled mackerel the most, not overly cooked, with a softly cooked interior while maintaining a crispy skin. It even came with a small Doenjang Jjigae ~ super flavourful soup broth with bits of beef.

All the ‘appies’ (kimchi, beans, potato salad) were a perfect sample taste. I wonder if I could have asked for more?

The staff were hospitable  and quick to serve and clear away.

Decor is modern, minimalistic yet relaxed.

I’m SO looking forward to coming back again!

The staff was friendly and always kept our pitcher of water filled. Like how they gave us individual condiments rather than the traditional “communal style” condiments.

Was disappointed that their seasonal Buckwheat cold noodle was well ... out of season."

Sura Korean Cuisine,Korean,"1696 Douglas Street Victoria, BC V8W 2G6 Canada",BC,48.4292923,-123.3647259,1,"Both dishes were a real flop. I had taken a bibimbap because I had heard that it was a very good dish, but I honestly didn't like it! I honestly think it's not the dish itself but the way the restaurant makes it. The tastelessness was really bad, as was the chow mein, the service was mediocre and the atmosphere of the restaurant is really depressing."
Bali Thai,Indonesian,"88 W Pender Street Vancouver, BC V6B 1R3 Canada",BC,49.2804064,-123.1069714,5,Great Indonesian food in a food court on the second floor. The owner suggested me to get the beef and chicken rice which comes with vegetables (eggplants or mushrooms). The owner is very friendly. The food court is clean and spacious. Great to drop by after going to China Town museums.
Bali Thai,Indonesian,"88 W Pender Street Vancouver, BC V6B 1R3 Canada",BC,49.2804064,-123.1069714,5,That was absolutely amazing. This has got to be one of my best food experiences in Vancouver. What just happened? That was insane. I ordered the beef rendang and egg balado with vegetables served alongside turmeric coconut rice. I can’t remember the last time I felt this sad taking my last bite of food. I have been converted to the church of Bali Thai. I will be coming here as often as I can.
Bali Thai,Indonesian,"88 W Pender Street Vancouver, BC V6B 1R3 Canada",BC,49.2804064,-123.1069714,5,Delicious and authentic. I grew up in Indonesia and its a rare treat to find Rendang Sapi and a good sambal sauce. Wonderful service and food.

Damso Modern Korean Cuisine,Korean,"867 Denman Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2L9 Canada",BC,49.2906636,-123.1370287,4,"Went during dinner time around the weekend at 6pm and was able to get seated. I got to try their toppoki, rose toppiki and their spicy pork bulgogi.

Despite the name suggests, the spicy pork bulgogi just has the right amount of kick that enhances the taste. Given the price, the meat to rice portion is actually more compared to other Korean places that serves little rice pots like this.

The regular toppoki is standard nothing too special about it and is spicy (as usual). The rose toppoki on the other hand has the same ingredients as the regular toppoki, just added with sausages and mushrooms, but the sauce used is different. It's milder and not spicy as far as I recall. So, if you crave for toppoki but prefer creamier and milder option, then rose toppoki is recommended."

The staff were very nice and friendly! We ordered their signature 48hr slow cook short ribs, Pork Belly Korean BBQ,Spicy Tofu Soup and Chestnut Makguli~I love the juicy ribs and the pork belly was paired with fresh lettuces that took away the oily feeling of the pork. It was our first time trying Makguli in an unique chestnut flavour: nutty and delicious, which balanced well with the food😊"

What a fantastic decision!! Food and drinks are tasty. My favorite dishes had to be the Two-ways squid and Seafood risotto! As for the drink, the server recommended The Railbird, which was a home run!

The services was lovely, the vibes in the restaurant were interesting but very pleasant. We had a great night and definitely would go back!"

Honey Salt,Canadian (New),"39 Smithe Street Vancouver, BC V6B 0R3 Canada",BC,49.27559,-123.11327,5,"Had a nice Friday brunch at Honey Salt (my first visit to the restaurant). They were kind enough to let me order their Sweet Potato Pancakes, usually available for weekend brunch; this was arranged before my visit. They were delicious and quite filling, although the almond butter was quite dense and sticky to the teeth. The Honey Salt Market is a great sharing dish, with a good amount of dips to go around for the veg and chips. Today, we were given guacamole, a spinach dip, and a sweet potato dip. My guest had their Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich. The fried chicken inside was so tender and moist, and the batter had a solid crunch.

We were celebrating a birthday and they brought out a small brownie cake with ice cream and a candle. Such a nice way to end a filling meal. Staff were kind and wished my guest a happy birthday as they introduced themselves and at the front desk. Our server was Janine and she was fantastic! On a Friday for brunch it wasn't very busy, but I imagine it will get busier at night or on the weekends. Chic and comfortable aesthetic inside."

The atmosphere here is a ten out of ten for sure. It's so beautiful inside the restaurant.  The food here was so delicious and tasty.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant  for everyone.  Five out of five for sure.  Definitely try their avocado toast and fish and chips, so good."
Honey Salt,Canadian (New),"39 Smithe Street Vancouver, BC V6B 0R3 Canada",BC,49.27559,-123.11327,3,"Vibes were on point, the decor was great! However my dish was quite small for the price and I felt that under the egg there was one piece of meat and a very small amount  of spinach and mushroom. The spinach and mushrooms tasted fantastic while the rest of the dish not covered in egg or the rest tasted dry and boring. None of us were very impressed by the food but the decor was great."
Honey Salt,Canadian (New),"39 Smithe Street Vancouver, BC V6B 0R3 Canada",BC,49.27559,-123.11327,3,"The service was good and food did have good taste but I’m giving only 3 stars because we got the seafood boil and the shrimp weren’t peeled and the crab legs were very hard to open, not pre cracked at all. It got quite messy. I added the lobster tail so the dish was $80. I think if paying that much for a dish it shouldn’t be so hard to eat. I also had 6 oysters for $24 and 2 of them had pieces of shell in them. Would expect better quality and ease to eat for such a high price."

Little Bird Dim Sum,Dim Sum,"2958 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6K 1R4 Canada",BC,49.2683086,-123.1715733,3,"Pre dinner snack before our late night hot pot, that’s why we didn’t order that many dishes

Dim sum is my favourite cuisine, I was curious how this modern restaurant would stack up against the traditional ones.

The green tea sesame balls were super tasty, but the other dishes were just average among other dim sum restaurants in greater Vancouver. We tried the golden corn dumplings, even Lux in Langley made a better version than them.

Maybe I have high standards regarding dim sum, I do think that they are making an effort to let more people try dim sum.

Unfortunately, for us traditional dim sum lovers we won’t be back"
Little Bird Dim Sum,Dim Sum,"2958 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6K 1R4 Canada",BC,49.2683086,-123.1715733,3,The Scallop taro puffs inside curry sauce were good match. The Chive & shrimp dumplings were delicious. The Vegetable Siu Mai were not my expectations. The BBQ Pork had some sand inside.
Little Bird Dim Sum,Dim Sum,"2958 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6K 1R4 Canada",BC,49.2683086,-123.1715733,5,"I grew up in HK and Shanghai, so I hold most dim sum to a pretty high regard. Some dishes have a fusion take to them, but for the most part the taste of each dish is pretty authentic. I’d rate it an 8.5/10 for authenticity, with the best places in Richmond ranking ~9 on my scale. The accompanying sauces were a mix of old classics and new interesting takes (wasabi mustard), but I didn’t really use them much. In my opinion, the taste aligns more with the younger demographic, it’s definitely more flavorful and stronger. I find other dim sum places to be on the bland side (sometimes to cater to the elderly), and constantly find myself drowning my food in sauces. I really liked the shrimp corn dumplings and the fried wontons. Not my usual go to at dim sum and I was pleasantly surprised. I would’ve taken better photos but the food was too good.

Yes, there’s better dim sum to be had in Van for cheaper, but those places have “bad service”🧐. Most top tier dim sum restaurants also turn into fancy Chinese dining at night, so Little Bird is a solid alternative option. This place is a little more elegant and date friendly. Great spot to go to after a day hanging around in the area.

Lots of the reviews point to the price, which is understandable. Our table was 50$ a head (42$ food, 8$ alcohol), so really not that bad in comparison to a dim sum bill in Richmond. We had a lot of leftovers too."
Little Bird Dim Sum,Dim Sum,"2958 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6K 1R4 Canada",BC,49.2683086,-123.1715733,4,Love the idea of dim sum for dinr with drinks and Little Bird delivered except for tight space as tables were about an inch apart. I like Haywire Pinot Noir which they serve with light dim sum fair which we enjoyed. Their fried items were crispy and tasty and steamed dumplings and sticky rice were fresh. The portions were smaller than conventional dim sum places as the orders came in a pair or 3s which means if 4 top someone's gonna miss out on the dumpling. They do advise upon arriving of their strict time limit for dining in but we found it sufficient as the food came out promptly and small bites take little time to inhale lol. Hope to return with a larger group so that we try everything else on the menu alongside some craft beers.

The Scallop Taro Puff was a particular standout.
The Steamed BBQ Pork Bun was a little disappointing in the bun to pork ratio."

The service was a a bit slow to start, but overall it was good. I was graciously seated by the manager I believe. I had the four course set menu from local fresh ingredients, and it did not disappoint (albeit the seeds in the strawberry orange salad - though the flavour was good).The risotto was amazing and had rich flavour, the duck was very tender and the bean/bacon was a good addition - I only hoped for a bit more, such as mashed potatoes or a little something. Loved the lavender atop the honey gelato and strawberry/rhubarb compote. I think I described that right..lol. Was impressed with one male expediter/busser, who was gentle kind and professional (can't remember his name but I think it was something like Mora/Omar?, I could be way off base). Loved the rooftop honey with my tea."

When you go to brunch at ARC you have two choices going for the order brunch menu and the a la cart menu. The all you can eat menu looked heavy so we went for the a la cart.

In short nothing stood out as me as special for the price we paid. The coffee though organic tasted burnt. The pancakes fluffy didn’t have a crunch or caramelization for that heightened experience. The crab egg Benny was pleasant but plain. The $9 bacon was mostly fat."

The tacos were so unique.
The cornbread was very interesting, its a must try! I think more micro greens were needed to help balance the richness of it.
Got 6 tacos (each order has 2 tacos): skirt steak polenta (the best one imo. Beef was cooked perfectly, blueberry was so interesting, and the polenta was really good in it), lamb (this was like solid meat, I didn’t enjoy it but my partner did), and the chicken (this was sooooo good! I heard this is a seasonal item but it should be kept around!! Taste was so good. Very heavy, I’d love to have more celery sticks even if it was on the side).

Was so full after this, but would love to taste the churros next time!"

Robba da Matti,Italian,"1127 Mainland Street Vancouver, BC V6B 5P2 Canada",BC,49.2754667,-123.1213319,5,This was a highlight of my visit to Vancouver. The Bruschetta Caprese was a fantastic and refreshing start to our meal. I had the lobster and crab stuffed ravioli which sounded amazing but far exceeded my expectations. My dining partner enjoyed the risotto with braised meet which he said was absolutely stellar. Everything was delightfully flavorful and the atmosphere was exceptionally pleasant. The service? Impeccable as well!

Food were all really good and  cocktail drinks and wine were also good. We were five people in a table, only problem here was if you were seated inside the restaurant and near the kitchen it was uncomfortable, and hot too. Also on a Saturday night, you only have 2 hours seating, even if you are still enjoying your drinks, you have to pay and leave, which was understandable for a small restaurant like this. But thank you Irene for a good service with a smile, chef for our good food, and bartender for our good cocktail drinks. Might come back, but not on a weekend for sure."
Robba da Matti,Italian,"1127 Mainland Street Vancouver, BC V6B 5P2 Canada",BC,49.2754667,-123.1213319,1,"***UNFAIR MANDATORY TIP POLICY IMPOSING ON A GROUP OF FIVE ***

I am deeply disappointed with my recent visit. Not only did they enforce a mandatory 20% tip, but they also insisted on applying it to my group of five, even though the policy clearly states it is for groups of six or more.

First, the server nor anything on the reservation page informed us about the mandatory 20% tip. And I was shocked when she insisted that we had to pay the 20% tip, despite having only five people in our group. According to their own policy, this tip should not have been applied to us.

What made matters worse was the server's complete lack of concern or understanding. She made it clear that she had no intention of rectifying the situation or offering any sort of compromise. Her dismissive and rude attitude only added to the frustration we felt as paying customers.

She stated that since we made a reservation of 6 people, this mandatory tip policy applied to us because she SPENT HER TIME RESERVING THE TABLE for us. However, I mentioned that they were going to seat us a 6-people table regardless. And she can inform us beforehand.

Springing it on us at the end of the meal, especially when it doesn't even apply to our group size, is both unfair and deceptive.

I believe that a restaurant's success lies not only in the quality of its food but also in the way it treats its customers. Unfortunately, this restaurant failed to deliver on both fronts. The mandatory tip policy and the server's poor attitude have left me with a negative impression that I cannot ignore.

In conclusion, I would caution others considering dining here to be wary of their unfair mandatory tip policy. If you value transparency and fair treatment as a customer, I recommend seeking alternatives where your dining experience is valued and respected."

The food was unbelievable. Carpaccio was absolutely phenomenal. My spouse ordered the lobster and crab ravioli, and he loved it. I ordered the red gnocchi and was very impressed.

La Mezcaleria,Mexican,"1622 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5L 3Y4 Canada",BC,49.2700977,-123.0692773,5,"Wow wow wow! Amazing elevated Mexican food, I can say their food tastes amazing, and their mezcal drinks are awesome, I got the brunch complete breakfast which brings a little bit of everything, and I got some tacos at happy hour which starts at 2, on top of everything customer service was 10/10. Definitely would recommend this restaurant."
Absinthe Bistro,French,"952 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5L 3W7 Canada",BC,49.2759796,-123.0693281,5,"French food and wine!  Need I say more? We were excited to try this place as we were missing authentic French food. We came here for a birthday dinner. This bistro brought me back to France. It’s a nice, intimate cozy place. We sat outside as it was such a warm day! The food was good. We ordered price fixe meal-which consists of a starter, entree and dessert. (You can also order starter and entree only) The portions were a good size-we almost wished we ordered the starter and entrée only. The service was slow, but we did not mind as we enjoyed ambiance and saw she was playing dual roles of server and hostess. Overall we would definitely come back."
Absinthe Bistro,French,"952 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5L 3W7 Canada",BC,49.2759796,-123.0693281,4,"Me and my frd came to Absinthe Bistro for my birthday. We had their set menu which offers good selection of meat and vegetarian dishes. I picked the foie gras as appetizer, it was rich and flavourful and that's what u would expect from foie gras from most places. Beef tartare was well seasoned, it was smooth and fragrant. The lamb rack was good in portion, a little too raw for my liking but I know authentic French lamb rack suppose to be medium rare. I likely asked the server if they can cook them for me for a little more, she gladly took it in and  it came back perfectly cooked to my liking with beautiful grill marks. When the server became aware of my birthday she offered to take a Polaroid pic for us. Super cute and personable service.

Ambiance was simple and open. I like how tables were well spaced out so it's not crowded."
Absinthe Bistro,French,"952 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5L 3W7 Canada",BC,49.2759796,-123.0693281,5,"My gal pals and I had an amazing meal. They have a set menu ""fixe prix"" menu 2 or 3 course. I chose the crab cakes starter, duck confit main and chocolate cake.  Michelan quality presentation, generous portions and amazing ingredients. I would highly recommend this restaurant for foodies. Had a taste of scallops, foods grois, halibut, creme brulee from my friends. All very delicious!
Friendly service, cute decor with absinthe vintage posters & chandelier patio seating.

I'll be back for a special dinner. Thanks Absinthe!"
Absinthe Bistro,French,"952 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5L 3W7 Canada",BC,49.2759796,-123.0693281,5,"I didn’t know what to expect when I chose to come here, but I knew that if they had a rotating, limited menu, the chef would have to know what they are doing. And did they ever!

For $65 per person, this place is so fairly priced. We ordered one of each thing on the menu that night and everything was PERFECT. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vancouver now, and for anyone that loves French food, you gotta come here. I can’t wait to come back!"
Absinthe Bistro,French,"952 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5L 3W7 Canada",BC,49.2759796,-123.0693281,5,"My Fiancé and I dined here in celebration of our 1 year anniversary and my birthday. We met in France while studying, and dining here allowed us to re-live the French dining experience in such a sweet way!
The staff were professional, but friendly. The food was incredibly tasteful and you can tell they made sure to present it as such. We especially enjoyed one of the side dishes which was grapefruit with cracked pepper—shockingly delicious!
At the end of the night our server took a Polaroid picture of us to keep! We used it to document the experience in our date journal❤️"
Ramen Danbo,Ramen,"1333 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 2B1 Canada",BC,49.2875039,-123.1289419,5,"MUST TRY! Worth the wait, must try, great simple ramen. The line ups can take over an hour at time but it’s worth it. Customer service is great, food is amazing and the atmosphere is welcoming and clean. Even with such a long line up, the staff are always so friendly and clean up after every guest so carefully to ensure the best experience for the next guest. Love this place!"
Ramen Danbo,Ramen,"1333 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 2B1 Canada",BC,49.2875039,-123.1289419,5,"You want Ramen in Vancouver? There are many options. This is no-nonsense delicious Ramen. Yes, Ramen, like Art, is subjective, but I can't imagine a scenario where a bowl of this could be sent back. Danbo is more consistent than the rain in this fair city for its ability to deliver an all around great bowl of Ramen. If you don't want to quibble about semantics and just have a delicious bowl, accept no substitute. I eat at a variety of Ramen joints, this one just hits every time. No Question."
Ramen Danbo,Ramen,"1333 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 2B1 Canada",BC,49.2875039,-123.1289419,5,"Had to wait a while in queue to eat there, but it was well worth the wait. Hands-down the best vegan ramen I’ve ever had. The customization options are great, the broth is delicious and the service is fast & friendly. Would easily recommend this place (as well as the Seattle location)."
Ramen Danbo,Ramen,"1333 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 2B1 Canada",BC,49.2875039,-123.1289419,5,Truly worth the wait. Incredible. Note the ramen doesn’t come with toppings so you have to add -on everything including egg
Ramen Danbo,Ramen,"1333 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 2B1 Canada",BC,49.2875039,-123.1289419,5,"Absolutely wonderful, Ramen! This was my first time having ramen, and it all tasted delicious. The environment and atmosphere were great, and even with a line outside for seating, it did not take long to get in. Highly recommended!"
Ramen Danbo,Ramen,"1833 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 1M4 Canada",BC,49.2682648,-123.1464325,5,"This is one of my favourite place for Vegan Ramen!! As I prefer to have vegetarian/vegan Ramen, its very difficult to find a place that offers multiple options! And Danbo is one of them! Try them out and I am sure it won’t be disappointment for you! I was impressed with its flavourful broth and service! Dining space is quite small but well-managed. Make sure to book a seat via yelp before reaching there.
A must-visit for delicious plant-based options and attentive service."
Ramen Danbo,Ramen,"1833 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 1M4 Canada",BC,49.2682648,-123.1464325,5,"Absolutely some of the best ramen I’ve had in all of Van, and easily top 5 I’ve had outside of Japan itself. The Rekka is a great spicy option, albeit they could still turn up the heat more from extra spicy. The wait can be quite long so don’t expect to just arrive & sit down. But the broth is full & very tasty, the noodles are delicious & I like that they let you pick firmness. The pork chashu is well cut & takes on flavour well. Can’t recommend this place enough."
Ramen Danbo,Ramen,"1833 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 1M4 Canada",BC,49.2682648,-123.1464325,3,"This is one of my favorites spots in Vancouver. The ramen is always on point and I have great memories coming here. However, when we visited on July 11th, our team of 5 had to wait for 2 hours to get inside. What made it worse was that smaller teams who had hardly waited got to go before us. I would have preferred if they had at least asked us first if it would be alright for us to sit separately. A team of four that came after us got to go in before us just because they had one less person. I’m not sure who is managing the queue but the waitlist seemed useless. I would suggest implementing a time limit for bigger groups as two big groups before us took their sweet time while they saw a huge line. What was more infuriating was that when we finally came in, they put together two smaller tables for us and added a stool on the side. I couldn’t help but wonder if they could have done that sooner instead of letting in couples who’d come after us finish their meal and then put the two tables together for us. I’m not sure if I want to come here again as long the customers in line are not treated seriously."
Ramen Danbo,Ramen,"1833 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 1M4 Canada",BC,49.2682648,-123.1464325,5,"Ramen Danbo gets my vote for some of the best ramen in Vancouver. Because there is limited seating inside, there is often a long waitlist to get seated, depending on your group size. Came during the week and for a larger group, there was about a hour long wait to get seated. Once seated the food came out very quickly and the both the ramen and broth was delicious. Love how you can order extra noodles too in case you have extra broth leftover. Prices are very reasonable as well. Will definitely have to come by here again"
Ramen Danbo,Ramen,"1833 W 4th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6J 1M4 Canada",BC,49.2682648,-123.1464325,4,"There’s always a wait so I was intrigued and decided to finally put my name down & try it. Small space inside but it wasn’t stuffy at all. Service is okay, they were really slammed with online orders all the way up to closing time. The ramen was good but I think you could have the same experience somewhere else with less wait."

Guu Original Thurlow,Japanese,"838 Thurlow Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1W2 Canada",BC,49.2840086,-123.1254349,4,It has been a long while since my last visit Guu Original at Thurlow. Simple menu with delectable choices. The flesh of the grilled saba fish was a bit on the harder side. Good value for the set at $13.80. Very pleasant dinning experience.
Guu Original Thurlow,Japanese,"838 Thurlow Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1W2 Canada",BC,49.2840086,-123.1254349,5,"Probably the best restaurant experience I've had in a while. Every dish we ordered was absolutely delicious but I particularly reccomend the kimchi udon, deep fried fish cakes, smoked salmon with onions, and unagi over rice. The atmosphere in the restaurant was on point and the service was very accommodating."
Jules French Bistro,French,"216 Abbott Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2K8 Canada",BC,49.2834427,-123.1064141,5,"Great food and atmosphere. Every dish is well executed, the duck confit had a crispy skin and moist fall off the bone meat. We also shared the escargot and calamari, the escargot definitely stood out better."
Jules French Bistro,French,"216 Abbott Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2K8 Canada",BC,49.2834427,-123.1064141,5,"Since we couldn’t go back to France this year, we decided to try a little bit of France here. This restaurant did not disappoint. Although not exact duplicates due to availability of French-produced ingredients (we miss Normandy butter!), it was still very good. Escargot was very good, foie gras was good, lobster bisque was excellent, steak frites with peppercorn sauce was cooked perfectly. Service was excellent and the room was charming. We’ve been to restaurants where dishes were Instagram-worthy but lacking in taste, this restaurant focused on taste. We will be back!"
Jules French Bistro,French,"216 Abbott Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2K8 Canada",BC,49.2834427,-123.1064141,5,Romantic and chic spot with amazing food.  Try the duck confit!  Local and fantastic music for happy hour.  The wine selection is also fantastic.  I also had the french onion soup which was great.  The fresh rolls were flawless.
Jules French Bistro,French,"216 Abbott Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2K8 Canada",BC,49.2834427,-123.1064141,5,"Absolute hidden gem. So cozy and warm inside and makes me feel like I’m a cute little bistro in Paris. Happy hour dishes are amazing, great value and delicious. Also ordered the prime rib burger and duck confit - a wee bit on the saltier side but still really good. Great wine selections too."
Jules French Bistro,French,"216 Abbott Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2K8 Canada",BC,49.2834427,-123.1064141,3,"If you happen to be in Gastown, Vancouver, this little bistro is worth visiting during its Happy Hour sessions which I think start at 1430 hrs. The place exhibits a cozy feel, service is so-so, food is acceptable but during Happy Hour -> oh, so affordable and worth it.

For whatever we ordered which was 3 “mains” plus 1 X 6 oz White Wine, we paid less than CAD50.00 (before tax)."
Joong Won,Korean,"1329 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1C6 Canada",BC,49.2874243,-123.1288342,5,The food was mediocre.  The baby octopus 🐙 was very rubbery.  It retained it shape even after I chew it for 1 min. 🤣 But the most annoying thing is the little flies flying around my table.
Joong Won,Korean,"1329 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1C6 Canada",BC,49.2874243,-123.1288342,5,"I always order malatang here late at night. The advantages of this place are delicious malatang and the most delicious tangsuyuk(sweet&sour pork) in Vancouver. I recommend malatang, but sweet and sour pork is super good, trust me! But this store has a big drawback: it takes a really long time to make food and often forget the ingredients and food. I think there is not enough manpower because this restaurant is open even at dawn. I think the overall quality will improve a lot if the shortage of people is covered."
Joong Won,Korean,"1329 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1C6 Canada",BC,49.2874243,-123.1288342,5,"The Tantan tonkotsu is literally the best thing ever on this menu! I really wished they had it available during the daytime. I’m not really a late night eater but, also there was this lemon ginger pork too they had, I really miss that, was it removed from the menu?"
Joong Won,Korean,"1329 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1C6 Canada",BC,49.2874243,-123.1288342,5,A place I found because I missed Korean jjajangmyeon.. The conclusion was successful.. Delicious food and friendly service.... The only regret I found was that the restaurant was a bit narrow.
Joong Won,Korean,"1329 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1C6 Canada",BC,49.2874243,-123.1288342,3,"Malatang was nice, it would be 4 stars if “level 1 - mild” wasn’t so spicy."
A.Bento,Taiwanese,"656W Broadway Vancouver, BC V5Z 1G1 Canada",BC,49.2632553,-123.1177614,5,Stopped by for a late lunch and was not disappointed. Place was pretty empty so was sat right away. Menu had lots of tasty options but opted for the spicy beef fried rice. Food was pretty fast and very tasty. I also ordered a Mango frost off of the drink menu which turned out to not be a drink but a dessert. It was super tasty and I want another one already. Now I want to try everything on the menu. Highly recommend.
A.Bento,Taiwanese,"656W Broadway Vancouver, BC V5Z 1G1 Canada",BC,49.2632553,-123.1177614,4,"My friend and I originally came here to try their new shaved ice menu and it didn't disappoint. 👍 We also may have gotten too excited in trying out their food that we ordered much more than we could eat, but that's okay, we got to take them home to eat the next day.

Price wise, it's reasonable if you think of how many servings these could feed. So remember to bring friends to share the greatness of this place!

If you'd like to try an assortment of appetizers, I do recommend their appetizer trio. It has fish cake, squid, and their signature chicken nuggets. It is a bit on the saltier side so beware of that. For rice, you can't go wrong with their spicy beef fried rice. It's packed with lots of meat and their meat is really soft and tasty. Their tiger prawn however is alright. Nothing too special about it in my opinion.

For the two drinks we got, they're a bit disappointing. The lychee tea mostly tasted like regular tea and it was quite diluted. Their nitro guava black tea was okay."
A.Bento,Taiwanese,"656W Broadway Vancouver, BC V5Z 1G1 Canada",BC,49.2632553,-123.1177614,4,"Food was ok, drink was good, not bad but no surprising flavors. Service was great,  servers are friendly and helpful when recommending dishes, clearing out dishes. Environment is good, pretty clean and spacious. Would be a good place for a regular day comfort food lunch or dinner, though price is kinda high for this type of food."
A.Bento,Taiwanese,"656W Broadway Vancouver, BC V5Z 1G1 Canada",BC,49.2632553,-123.1177614,4,"As a Taiwanese, I’ve always enjoyed exploring Taiwanese food. The food is pretty authentic. You can even find the street food”oyster pancakes “ here. That really surprised me!! But I find the food a bit pricey and the service wasn’t really good. But it’s still worth to try"
A.Bento,Taiwanese,"656W Broadway Vancouver, BC V5Z 1G1 Canada",BC,49.2632553,-123.1177614,5,"Night out menu is great for January and February

The Taiwanese food is very peppery (pepper, not spicy). It was delicious and a good change to what I usually eat. They also keep the food relevant so it doesnt get boring if you visit often. I would recommend. The restaurant is very popular for good reason. We got a reservation, but even then it's still busy. Place is great for special occasions with friends or taking dates

The server said the chef and owner are still working on getting desserts on the menu. That would be appreciated, cross my fingers. Dessert is the only thing missing from this flawless menu"
Lamajoun,Mediterranean,"128-11782 River Road Richmond, BC V6X 1Z7 Canada",BC,49.1961824,-123.0951555,4,"The food was nice, we enjoyed the meal. The staff were super nice, they prepared the food and send it upstairs by an elevator. The biggest problem was that the dining area was filled with smoke which came from grilling in the kitchen. I would try the food again but definitely for a take out. The chicken was tasty and tender, Lahmajoun had a sour taste to it which was not bad but it was strong."
Lamajoun,Mediterranean,"128-11782 River Road Richmond, BC V6X 1Z7 Canada",BC,49.1961824,-123.0951555,5,"The food and service here are absolutely fantastic. The man who runs the place is always so kind and friendly and has a huge smile whenever I see him. The food they made is fantastic. The bread is super thin and crispy but also stretchy too. The chicken was super moist and very flavourful as well.

I have to say my favorite part though was the dessert. The napolean cake is made with light crispy pastry layers surrounding layers of cloud like sweet cream. It's SO good.

Lastly, the food elevator is very novel and kind of fun."
Lamajoun,Mediterranean,"128-11782 River Road Richmond, BC V6X 1Z7 Canada",BC,49.1961824,-123.0951555,5,"Oh man. Do yourselves a favour and come here. The service was OUTSTANDING - super friendly, warm, and personable, and all of our questions about the menu were patiently answered. The food was great and very reasonably priced. A super unassuming location with seating on the second floor. A must-try, and we will be returning whenever we are in the area!"
Lamajoun,Mediterranean,"128-11782 River Road Richmond, BC V6X 1Z7 Canada",BC,49.1961824,-123.0951555,5,"Delicious, unpretentious Armenian/Georgian restaurant, tucked away in Richmond.

Harambe Restaurant,Ethiopian,"2149 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5N 4B3 Canada",BC,49.2655668,-123.0699715,3,"It was our first with Ethiopian cuisine and this restaurant ambience was the best giving a traditional touch in the way dishes were displayed.

Peanut soup tasted amazing! Platter portion had a little bit of everything for both veg and non veg. They even offered choices of curries for the non veg platter where we could choose some of the dishes we liked as we do not consume beef.

Injera was highly sour in taste and not sure if that is how it usually tastes and that was the only traditional bread available. The sour taste was not that appealing to few of us.

The portion size is very small compared to price. Over all an okay experience."
Harambe Restaurant,Ethiopian,"2149 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5N 4B3 Canada",BC,49.2655668,-123.0699715,4,Great taste and very authentic! Honey wine is not overly sweet and home made. We had Kitfo and shared a one person's chief special. Great times! Definitely my go to place for Ethiopian food!
Harambe Restaurant,Ethiopian,"2149 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5N 4B3 Canada",BC,49.2655668,-123.0699715,1,"My friends and I recently had the opportunity to dine at Harambe Ethiopian Restaurant, and I must say it was a disappointing experience. We had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately, we encountered a few issues that left me with a bad taste in my mouth, quite literally.

First and foremost, the injera, a traditional Ethiopian flatbread, was not up to par. It had a rather unpleasant sour taste, which took away from the overall enjoyment of the meal. One of the spinach side dishes too was sour and I stayed away from a second helping of that dish.

To make matters worse, one of my friends found a fly in their drink. Attached is the picture of it. This was not only unappetizing but also a major hygiene concern. It's unacceptable for a restaurant to serve beverages with insects in them, and it definitely affected our dining experience. Worst part, the waitress initially argued that it wasn't a fly until she saw it herself.

But the most disturbing incident occurred when our waitress dipped her finger tip into our drink to scoop something out. This was a complete breach of basic food handling practices and left us feeling extremely uncomfortable. It's essential for the staff to maintain proper hygiene standards, and this incident was a glaring violation.

Given these experiences, I regret to say that I would not consider returning to Harambe Ethiopian Restaurant. The issues we encountered were too significant to overlook, and they greatly impacted our overall impression of the place. I value cleanliness, quality, and attentive service when dining out, and unfortunately, this restaurant failed to meet these expectations.

I hope the management of Harambe Ethiopian Restaurant takes these concerns seriously and works towards improving their food quality and hygiene practices. Until then, I would advise potential diners to exercise caution when considering this establishment for a meal."
Harambe Restaurant,Ethiopian,"2149 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5N 4B3 Canada",BC,49.2655668,-123.0699715,5,I love this restaurant! Especially the fish platter! It melts on you tongue. I also like their tea very much. And that they displqy art on the walls. I got inspired by it!
Harambe Restaurant,Ethiopian,"2149 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5N 4B3 Canada",BC,49.2655668,-123.0699715,4,"My first time having Ethiopian food. The restaurant had good ambiance and bonus points for good lighting at the table! Service was friendly, but not attentive - took multiple asks to get water and it was slow. Food was good, I just don’t think it’s my palette. Dumaskli Soup was my favourite - a sweet soup with a little kick to it. Chef’s Choice Combination Platter for Two People was a great way to sample different dishes, I liked this. The Ye Assa Tibs (fish) reminded me of Chinese fish dishes. The Injera is like a less mild sourdough made into a steamed tortilla with bread consistency - not my favourite but I believe it’s personal taste as my friends liked it. Our meal came to $93 after tips for 3 people."
The Roof,Seafood,"1032 Alberni Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 1X6 Canada",BC,49.2844811,-123.1230538,5,"Our first time in Vancouver BC and after a heavy days shopping we visited this restaurant, having passed it earlier in the day, for a quick drink. We initially sat outside at street level only to be directed to the roof terrace accessed by a lift - this was a fortunate move for us that was well received.

Briefly; a stunning roof terrace with the kitchen open to the seating area. Not much of a view but the cool vibe, smooth fixtures and furniture and chilled sound track more than made up for this. Our drink quickly turned into a meal and several drinks. The food was excellent and not as pricey as the surroundings would lead you to believe. The waiting staff were as alert and attentive than any that I have encountered. A lush experience. I fully recommend a visit."
The Roof,Seafood,"1032 Alberni Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 1X6 Canada",BC,49.2844811,-123.1230538,4,"I like the atmosphere here, always good vibes around. We tried dine out 2023, the appetizer I chose scallops and bacon, I liked it. The main steak I ordered as medium rare, inside was perfect, but bit overcooked outside for me….it was hard. The sauce was good as well the side. I wish I had a more variety of salad thou. The dessert crème brûlée was bit sweet to me. Overall, it was good, but not the best this year."
The Roof,Seafood,"1032 Alberni Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 1X6 Canada",BC,49.2844811,-123.1230538,5,My girlfriend and I love this place!! We come here for happy hour and it has always been amazing! The staff are friendly - make sure you make a reservation before coming in just to guaranty a spot!
The Roof,Seafood,"1032 Alberni Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 1X6 Canada",BC,49.2844811,-123.1230538,4,"This is a cool place for sure, but we went for Happy Hour and had better food in other places in Vancouver for sure. The Mac and cheese bites were good, but the wagyu brisket was over cooked. Overall it wasn’t bad, but def over priced for all the hype."
The Roof,Seafood,"1032 Alberni Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 1X6 Canada",BC,49.2844811,-123.1230538,1,"DON'T GO THERE! IT IS FULL OF MICE! Last Friday night (July 21st), my wife and I went to this restaurant for the first time, and it turned out to be a disaster! We were in the middle of our dinner when we spotted three mice running around on the floor. Yikes! We couldn't believe our eyes!
After we finished eating and paid the bill, we told the manager, whose name starts with 'P,' about the mice. But guess what? He acted like it was no big deal! He said it's totally normal to see mice in downtown restaurants and that we're just not used to it because we're from outside the downtown area. Like, seriously?!

We expressed our concerns about the hygiene and how it could put people's health at risk. Not to mention, all the utensils, food, and table settings would be exposed to potential contamination. But he just brushed us off and said it's none of our business to ask about what they're doing to address the issue. Can you believe the nerve?

Honestly, we felt so grossed out and upset by the whole thing. With his indifferent attitude, we decided to get out of there as fast as we could. It's so disappointing to experience this in a supposedly fancy restaurant. We won't be going back, that's for sure! This whole ordeal left us seriously questioning their quality and safety standards.
Reading other reviews, it seems it has been more than a month and they took no actions for resolving it."
Tetsu Sushi Bar,Japanese,"775 Denman Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2L6 Canada",BC,49.2918512,-123.1352333,5,"I enjoyed the omakase here. My favorites were the Scallop, the Spot Prawn, any of the Bluefin, the Sea Urchin, and the King Salmon Otoro!

-Scallop from Hotate
-Sea-bream
-Spot prawn (shaoxing wine on top)
-Golden eye snapper
-Tachiuo /cutlass fish
-Nodoguro/black throat seaparch
-Katsuo/bonito
-Bluefin tuna chutoro
-Bluefin tuna slightly higher than chutoro but one step lower than otoro
-King salmon otoro
-Sea urchin with fish roe from Hokkaido
-Bluefin tuna negitoro

A bit pricey, but would recommend. It's a small restaurant, reservations is a must!"
Tetsu Sushi Bar,Japanese,"775 Denman Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2L6 Canada",BC,49.2918512,-123.1352333,5,"From the Japanese minimalist interior to the thoughtfully orchestrated nigiri Omakase menu, Tetsu Sushi Bar is an experience having you booking again and again."

Tetsu Sushi Bar,Japanese,"775 Denman Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2L6 Canada",BC,49.2918512,-123.1352333,5,"Awesome omakase dinner. You can feel the real taste of fine japanese with good selection of sake. The price is hiked with covid inflation, $200/p ends up $300/p after adding specials & sake bottle. Not sure how to say on value these days as everything get hiked. I enjoyed very much the special day dinner. This small place only can take 4 groups about 10ppl total, could talk pleasantly and quietly, surrounded by modern classic guitar sound."
Tetsu Sushi Bar,Japanese,"775 Denman Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2L6 Canada",BC,49.2918512,-123.1352333,5,"One of my must visit restaurants during my visits to Vancouver. This place is hands down the best sushi place! I discovered the place by accident, wandering the East End looking for a sushi restaurant. Found this Gem and have never looked back. You can get some of the best imported seafood from Japan, along with fresh local wares. But my favorite is probably the Foie Gras Donbori. They pair just enough rice and sauce to make it delicious down to the last grain of rice without diluting the aroma of the Foie Gras."

Spotless restaurant and has friendly staff. Has a variety of options and vegetarian items.

I tried the cheese quesadilla, fish taco and nachos; they were delicious. I really enjoyed the taco bread - it’s freshly made and melts in the mouth"

I had a vegan taco and it was flavored beautifully, just needed a little fat in it like avocado. THE SHRIMP AND PINEAPPLE TACOS ARE FROM THE GODS!"

The staff is very friendly and helpful. I gave it a 4 because the lamb taco was not available today. The other items we got however arrived quick, were fresh and well made.
Definitely give them a try."
Maizal RMF,Mexican,"2815 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5T 3G1 Canada",BC,49.259987,-123.1013715,5,"Highly recommended spot for burritos and tacos. The portions here are incredibly generous. I recommend trying their chicken mole and the lamb burritos. The chicken mole is my absolute favourite and typical go to. Their burritos are packed full and the meats are super flavourful! You can't go wrong with their tacos either, 3 should be more than enough for one person based on the portion size.This has definitely become one of my new favourite burrito and tacos places in Vancouver."
Sawasdee Thai Restaurant,Thai,"4250 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3P9 Canada",BC,49.2470563,-123.1008276,4,"Long standing Thai restaurant in the community. Their curry is creamy and flavourful and their Tom Yum soup is a must order, it's hard to find Tom yum that is so bold with flavour and acidity. Pad see ew has been good too but might be on the slight saltier side. Service always has been great. Their hours is tough though as they only open for 4 hours daily now."
Sawasdee Thai Restaurant,Thai,"4250 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3P9 Canada",BC,49.2470563,-123.1008276,5,"Honestly this is the best Thai food I've ever had. My gf and I came in and every dish we ordered was phenomenal. I personally don't know how anyone could give this place less than 5 stars. Great picks are Oyster Beef, chicken saute, green curry and pad pew."
Sawasdee Thai Restaurant,Thai,"4250 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3P9 Canada",BC,49.2470563,-123.1008276,5,Hit it 👍🏿! One of my favorite Thai places in the world. The food here is very consistent and always delicious. I love how it's been family run since I started going here almost 10 years ago. It's hard to recommend anything on the menu because it's all so good. The only thing I would warn you is that it can get quite busy so make sure you make reservations.
Sawasdee Thai Restaurant,Thai,"4250 Main Street Vancouver, BC V5V 3P9 Canada",BC,49.2470563,-123.1008276,5,"All of the dishes are delicious, and I highly recommend trying their braised pork and cauliflower. For drinks, the Thai-style milk tea is a must-try. The prices are also very reasonable, averaging around 15-20 dollars per person, and you can have a very filling meal. Plus, you can also take some leftovers home with you."

They were very busy but the service was fast. I ordered four dishes, all of them were really good. I strongly recommend the pineapple fried rice. And the Chi Chi cocktail was amazing as well."
Do Chay,Vietnamese,"1392 Kingsway Vancouver, BC V5V 3E4 Canada",BC,49.2500606,-123.0765209,4,"Great vegetarian food - amazing flavour and texture in all the dishes that is pretty close to their non-vegetarian counterparts.  Definitely get the spring rolls, coconut rice cakes and banh xeo for starters!

Service was attentive and quick while the atmosphere in the restaurant was fitting and chic."
Do Chay,Vietnamese,"1392 Kingsway Vancouver, BC V5V 3E4 Canada",BC,49.2500606,-123.0765209,5,"First time.
Excellent service, delicious foods and good price.
Moonsoo roll you need to try it. Fresh and delicious. The pineapple sauce I wish I could have a bottle of it.
The Uncle Hings wings very delicious.
My friend had vegan prawn curry and I had Lemongrass tofu. Very very tasty. Definitely recommend this place and I will go back♥️"
Do Chay,Vietnamese,"1392 Kingsway Vancouver, BC V5V 3E4 Canada",BC,49.2500606,-123.0765209,4,"Reviewing as a meat eater, I would eat this type of food regularly.

Curries were very fragrant, spiced to perfection but like a few others noted, slightly on the sweet side. They also skimped on the fake meat. I'd like to see a bit more fake shrimp.

I didn't care for the crepe salad dish. It's dominated by greens and beans sprouts.

Appetizers like spring rolls and coconut rice things were good.

Seating is spacious. I like that they don't cram diners into the row of booth seating."
Do Chay,Vietnamese,"1392 Kingsway Vancouver, BC V5V 3E4 Canada",BC,49.2500606,-123.0765209,5,"The food is truly impressive, and I am not a vegetarian. Not even close! We tried a variety of offerings and none of them disappointed! If I dined alone, I will start with the Diakon Cakes and have Desert Island Noodles as the main. I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant."
Do Chay,Vietnamese,"1392 Kingsway Vancouver, BC V5V 3E4 Canada",BC,49.2500606,-123.0765209,4,"It's a Vietnamese restaurant specializing in vegetarian food (the meaning of the restaurant name Do Chay). We had the vegetarian pho, banh khot (mini pancakes) and banh tieu (fried bread) which was stuff with cooked young jackfruit. The pho was pretty good and the mini pancakes were very rich in coconut cream, a bit too much for my taste. The banh tieu was ok, kinda bland to me although my aunt really liked it. I applaud the creativity."

Mine friend got burger with fries and she enjoyed it. The portion is perfect, not too big so I can finish everything. I would come back to try other dishes"
MeeT in Gastown,Comfort Food,"12 Water Street Vancouver, BC V6B 1A5 Canada",BC,49.2834986,-123.1048174,5,"Loved it! I’m not vegan or vegetarian lover and didn’t even knew its vegan place before visiting. We ordered sweet spicy cauliflower, Thai noodly and burger! Everything tasted great! If you are not found of sweet noodle, skip the thai noodles. It was good but had sweet taste! Also, their ginger elixir is must have in cold weather! Besides that, service and ambience is top notch. Give it a try and you will like it as much as I did :)"
MeeT in Gastown,Comfort Food,"12 Water Street Vancouver, BC V6B 1A5 Canada",BC,49.2834986,-123.1048174,5,"Nice vibe in the restaurant. Trendy music and modern urban decoration is exactly where you want to come for a drink with friend or date night.

I ordered fresh soup with sundries tomato ( daily soup is different), cheesy pesto spinach dip, and Thai noodle with tofu and veges. I would definitely come again. Warm welcome and great service."

We are a vegetarian family and look for options when we visit places. My daughter found this and I am so glad she did. We had brunch - steak tostadas, waffles, sunshine benny and gnocchi. All the items were delicious and drinks were very refreshing too. Not often you find so much variety and good quality vegetarian/vegan food. Our server Astrid (think) was very friendly too.
Highly recommended!!"

I'm not vegan, but it makes it easy to find things for my partner and this place by far blew other locations we ate at in the area out of the water.

Don't knock vegan food until you try it!"
The Vancouver Fish Company,Seafood,"1517 Anderson St Vancouver, BC V6H Canada",BC,49.2705997,-123.1365764,4,"Our server was fantastic - Gabrielle.
The reception lady was rather indifferent.

Nice atmosphere.  Do sit outside on a Sunday day. Feel the vibes. They get happy hour - limited choices on selected drink and food.

Order some oysters - quite small in size but sweet"
The Vancouver Fish Company,Seafood,"1517 Anderson St Vancouver, BC V6H Canada",BC,49.2705997,-123.1365764,4,"It’s my first time dinning in here.  Our server, Brenna, was quick and attentive.  Food tasted great.  Drinks tasted great.  My son and I enjoyed our time together.  The only dissatisfaction I have was the portion size.  It was on the smaller size for the price I paid."
The Vancouver Fish Company,Seafood,"1517 Anderson St Vancouver, BC V6H Canada",BC,49.2705997,-123.1365764,4,"A swish yet casual restaurant next to a marina. It was a good choice for chilling out with friends on the patio while catching the early evening sun. (There are blinds to shade you if it's in your eyes!)

The fish and chips were excellent with top notch presentation and taste. A friend had a dozen oysters and was pleased with them.

It was quite busy and that gave the restaurant a buzzy atmosphere, helped along by the happy hour drinks.

Service was quick, efficient and formulaic.

Overall,  a very nice way to spend a couple of hours in the evening."

Happy hour beer and wine is a great deal."
JOEY Burrard,Canadian (New),"820 Burrard St Vancouver, BC V6Z 1X9 Canada",BC,49.282606,-123.1231879,5,"We stopped by JOEY Burrard for a quick bite to eat on a Sunday. We were seated on the patio right away.
We ordered an Ahi Tuna Club (Salmon substitute) and a lettuce wrap with Chicken. The salmon club was pretty good.
So was the lettuce wrap. However, there was no peanuts in the mix for the lettuce wrap. Not even one.
Service was amazing. I wish I had asked our server’s name. He was attentive, helpful and professional."
JOEY Burrard,Canadian (New),"820 Burrard St Vancouver, BC V6Z 1X9 Canada",BC,49.282606,-123.1231879,4,"One of favorite places to come for celebration dinners and we've been to most of their locations in the Lower Mainland.  Our menu favorites include: the sliders for the starters menu, chicken katsu salad, and the lava cake.  A really nice touch was that when starters or desserts were ordered to share between 2, they plated the portions separately. Best for small groups of 4-6.  Although we made our recent reservation well in advance & confirmed details over the phone several times, our party of 9 was seated at a booth which seats 4-5 comfortably with a table pushed up to it for 3 more. Only when paying the bill was I informed by our server there's another space by the wine bar groups can request."

JOEY Burrard,Canadian (New),"820 Burrard St Vancouver, BC V6Z 1X9 Canada",BC,49.282606,-123.1231879,5,"This was our first time here and it was amazing!  We started off with a crunchy potato roll that the waiter recommended, and it was delicious and unique.

I got the steak & sushi dish - the steak was so tendy and flavorful, and the sushi was delicious.  My husband got the steak frites, and loved the steak and entire dish.

The waiter was also very friendly, the atmosphere was cozy, and the prices were fair.  We had no complaints and would definitely recommend this place!"

I'd never been to this restaurant.  I was not disappointed... fabulous food (I had the Mediterranean bowl), exceptional service and a cozy booth.  My other 3 friends loved their meals too.  The Joey 75 champagne cocktail was so good I took a picture of the ingredients to replicate it at home. Thanks Joey!"
Marché Mon Pitou,Cafes,"1387 W 7th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6H 1B8 Canada",BC,49.2654363,-123.135785,5,I ordered a Flat White and it was the best coffee I’ve had so far. The food is tasty and the raspberry tart is nice. Staff are so friendly. The cafe is small but it still could cater for around 14 people. It’s a very nice place to have a lunch and coffee in a cozy afternoon.
Marché Mon Pitou,Cafes,"1387 W 7th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6H 1B8 Canada",BC,49.2654363,-123.135785,1,"Today I visited them for the 4th time since they had opened the place, and was quite disappointed with the menu and taste. They used to have smoked salmon with scrambled egg, croque madame, french toast, .. but none of those existed on the menu this time.
We got the fig and prosciutto, and the eggs Benedict with bacon. Both had basic taste. The fig and parma ham definitely needed a sauce to tie them together. The poached egg was broken.
Also, you would see these comments in the store and on the menu a lot “Politely decline to warm pastries”, “politely decline to  make any changes to the menu item”, “politely decline to let you seat anywhere if you only order drinks and pastries”. They won’t even replace fried egg on the menu with scrambled eggs.
I get that the chef probably takes a lot of pride in designing and changing the menu often but if they continue doing so and removing their popular item, they will be closing in a few years.
Outside area only has one umbrella and the photos I’ve attached show how empty the place is at around 1pm on a Saturday!
I remember that you used to wait for sometime to get a table in the past, but the degradation in food quality has caused the place to be quite empty.

Their pastries are still good. We had the fig danish and it was delicious."
Marché Mon Pitou,Cafes,"1387 W 7th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6H 1B8 Canada",BC,49.2654363,-123.135785,4,"The brunch here is exceptional. Without a doubt, the hollandaise sauce is the finest I've ever tasted. The ambiance is simply delightful, reminiscent of the beautiful southern region of France. Furthermore, the staff are incredibly kind and hospitable. If you're in Vancouver, you simply must come here. This is a charming location to enjoy Sunday brunch. The quality of the ingredients is excellent, and the washroom is beautifully designed. Despite the focus on French cuisine, there are also vegan choices available."
Marché Mon Pitou,Cafes,"1387 W 7th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6H 1B8 Canada",BC,49.2654363,-123.135785,5,"Mon Pitou is perfection. The ambience is so carefully thought out and fun, the coffee is spectacular and full of flavor, and the food is outstanding! You really can’t ask for more, Vancouver is lucky to have a French cafe of this quality.

I got the ham and cheese danish and a cortado and couldn’t have been more pleased. Can’t wait to come back to try more things. The music and atmosphere is so relaxing 🙏🏽 🇫🇷"
Marché Mon Pitou,Cafes,"1387 W 7th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6H 1B8 Canada",BC,49.2654363,-123.135785,5,"The food is always fantastic, and the staff are so great. My husband and I often stop by for their breakfast sandwiches, but their actual brunch is really good. Pricey, but all brunch places are getting to be pricier these days, so it isn't really surprising or unexpected.  My only complaint is that it feels a bit cramped when it gets busy, but it can't be helped given the constraints of the location."
Hawksworth Restaurant,Canadian (New),"801 W Georgia Street Vancouver, BC V6C 1P7 Canada",BC,49.2834361,-123.1192058,4,We ordered the 3-course lunch menu.

Hawksworth Restaurant,Canadian (New),"801 W Georgia Street Vancouver, BC V6C 1P7 Canada",BC,49.2834361,-123.1192058,4,"Food was amazing, service was great as well. Although my table wasn't ready and had to wait at the lounge for about 10 -15 minutes, not a big deal. What bothered me was the atmosphere and ambiance of the restaurant. It was loud, noisy, huge table of 10+ sitting by tables of 2s. Last time I was here was more than 8 years ago but I remembered it as more intimate/romantice atmosphere. But nonetheless, food was delicious!"

The view of coal harbour and the snow topped mountains were incomparable and serene.  The ambiance and decor was also excellent.

Our server was attentive and welcoming.

We ordered the $65 pp high tea service which came with a small selection of tea.  Certain choices required additional cost. We also ordered a la cart caviar.  The variety and portions of food was perfect.  We even had left overs!

I would've given 5 stars if the tea selection was larger.

Overall I'd recommend visiting this restaurant and would definitely come back for other special occasions."

Dining here will be an unforgettable event. You enjoy  the exceptional waterfront views and the beauty of sunset. The menu is exquisite with unique options of duck, several kinds of fish and steak. Every dish is unique and pairing with drinks and wine is perfect.

The staff is brilliantly charming and lovely. We had our server who is a student at UBC doing her masters! You cannot find this kind of experienced and professional staff anywhere else. We were offered an experience of Devil's Coffee,only two people know how to make it and one of them is here at Five Sails. Check out the video of how he makes coffee that you have never heard of or tried before. Will cherish this coffee taste forever.

10 out of 10 for this fine dining place  for experience, staff and unique menu."

The service was excellent. I have a food intolerance and the servers handled it so well making sure to tell us which plates I needed to avoid. The food was really tasty. I liked how clean the restaurant is considering each table has its own grill built in. That grill definitely gets hot so make sure you're dressed in something short sleeve or you'll be sweating up a storm 😅. I'll dine here again for sure, thank you!"

The quality of the meats, whether flavorful beef, marinated chicken or seasoned seafood are exceptional. The DIY cooking approach adds a unique interactive touch, making the experience fun.

Their vegetarian options and variety of side dishes are really great; Garlic Spinach, steamed broccoli, mushrooms, spicy cabbage salad and more..

The staff were attentive, and so helpful, but I had an expert with me, who made the experience more tasty! 😋
They helped us with the grill on the spot, changed the surface from time to time, they’re amazing!!"

Very friendly & efficient staff who welcome all the guests as they walk to their table. Clean tables & grills. They change the grill part way through the meal. We had the Value Course and it was enough for the 2 of us. Meats are fresh and bright. Vegetables are fresh and crisp.  Rice is a good consistency and each person gets their own bowl. Salad was fresh and crisp. I would like the large leafs cut smaller, but it stays crisper with the big leafs. Tasty dressing.  They gave us complimentary ice cream with delicious chocolate sauce for being 1st time guests. Overall, anexcellent experience!"
Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ,Japanese,"G3-888 Nelson Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 2H1 Canada",BC,49.2800583,-123.1252306,4,"The food was great. The marinated meats were full of flavour without the need for the sauces but were a bit too salty for us. I liked the enoki mushroom and garlic mushroom more than the assorted vegetables which were plain except the corn.

The service was decent. The server constantly walked by. She liked to adjust the heat setting on our grill, but after most of the first batch of pork belly went burnt in the first two minutes (the Grill Guide said 3-5 minutes), we would re-adjust the heat after she left. I understand that the suggestion of longer cooking times is to prevent food borne illnesses.

The kitchen and the rest of the restaurant were playing different music. We could hear both from where we sat, it was noisy and eventually got annoying, even if I liked both music tracks. For example, the kitchen was playing Bruno Mars’s “Locked Out of Heaven” while the other side was playing Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You.”

All in all, I liked the food and our server’s attitude and attentiveness but not so much the ambiance and the indoor dining environment. They do have an outdoor eating area."

The portions are big and the quality of the meat is amazing - it’s such great value especially if you go during happy hour! I recommend the kalbi beef and toro beef, as well as the garlic noodles and cold tofu with kimchi."
Black Frog Eatery,Pubs,"108 Cambie Street Vancouver, BC V6B 2M8 Canada",BC,49.2845497,-123.1085711,5,"While visiting Vancouver in 2018, we stopped at the corner of Water Street & Cambie and the Gastown Steam Clock. After taking some of the usual tourist photos & waiting for the steam to blow the whistle, we found our way to the Black Frog Eatery. Settling in at 1 pm we were warmly welcomed and quickly seated. From our table we had an excellent view of the Steam Clock. I watched tourists posing with the clock as we awaited our order.

We weren’t very hungry and decided to share a club sandwich.  I’m happy to say that it was made with real meat—none of that sliced processed poultry!  The fries were good too, and I washed it all down with a local award-winning Kokanee lager.

The ambiance of the Black Frog is definitely that of a pub-style eatery and the decor accentuates that feel.  That’s a good thing, and to me, very comforting. Lot’s of wood, brick, and pub-style elements all around. This is absolutely the type of place I’d have lunch at if I’d worked in the area.  Their menu has a good selection to satisfy everyone’s tastes. Prices are on par with other restaurants offering similar fare.  The type of place that I call “no nonsense and basic good eating”. Service was prompt, efficient, and the staff knew their menu well. When we find our way back to Vancouver, I will certainly plan on coming back."

Amazing staff and customer service and a great atmosphere with all the right options on the drink and food menu!    Thanks to the owner and the great staff (Nemo, Sally and Taylor) for making me feel welcome from the start.  I only wish I found it earlier, it would have saved me on my quest for a super cool place to hang and waste away an afternoon in Vancouver.   I WILL be back!!"

Browns Crafthouse Seymour,Beer Bar,"580 West Pender Downtown Vancouver, BC V6B 1W7 Canada",BC,49.2837737,-123.113725,3,The customer service was super slow. Our server seemed like she was in a bad mood. The food took too long to arrive even though it wasn’t busy at all. I had to go to the front desk to ask for the bill after waiting for half an hour because our server kept ignoring us. Won’t be coming back. Food was good but the dessert tasted so bad.

Ahi tuna salad is great - good tuna that has been (just) cooked to perfection."

Fat Mao Noodles,Asian Fusion,"938 Helmcken Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 2S5 Canada",BC,49.2799016,-123.1272458,4,"I was very excited to try this place! As many of you know, they have a strong social media marketing team showing off their delicious noodles and soups.

I had the Tom Yum seafood noodles (pictured below), and the price came out to $27.77 including a 15% tip. The flavor was certainly above average, and the waitstaff was very friendly and accommodating! I would say value is a bit of a weakness here, as the meal was rather light and I noticed the soup in the bowls were not filled all the way (might seem like a small thing, but it felt like the soup proportion was off throughout the meal).

Tip: If you don’t know your noodles, ask the waitstaff! They have you customize your noodles for almost all the soup options, but some noodles are more suitable than others for certain types of broth.

Overall, solid 4 stars- not the best, but certainly good."
Fat Mao Noodles,Asian Fusion,"938 Helmcken Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 2S5 Canada",BC,49.2799016,-123.1272458,5,Wow! What a lovely discovery this place is. I enjoyed my Khai Soi Chicken so much I could have licked the bowl! So tasty. We got there in the nick of time because as we were leaving there was a small line up waiting to get in to the cozy restaurant.
Fat Mao Noodles,Asian Fusion,"938 Helmcken Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 2S5 Canada",BC,49.2799016,-123.1272458,5,"Awesome place for a bowl of noodles. Wish we had a fat mao in Toronto! I ordered the braised beef bowl which was delicious. Our table also got the tuna ceviche and the roti curry appetizer which were both very good.

All four of us were very happy with our meals. The wonton egg noodles are really good here. I will say this restaurant is definitely more on the pricey side, as just a bowl of noodles is $23. But it was very good.

It is also a little bit of a smaller restaurant, not really the most accommodating for larger groups. Would recommend it for pairs though."
Fat Mao Noodles,Asian Fusion,"938 Helmcken Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 2S5 Canada",BC,49.2799016,-123.1272458,4,"stopped by this place for dinner with friends .We ordered Tom Yum Goong , Khao soi chicken curry,Thai Ice tea and Roti with curry. The food was ok but for the price of small portions,  they are kinda over priced . The Thai ice tea is plain , not recommended."
Fat Mao Noodles,Asian Fusion,"938 Helmcken Street Vancouver, BC V6Z 2S5 Canada",BC,49.2799016,-123.1272458,5,"This is absolutely an authentic place for Thai noodles. At first, my Thai boyfriend was shocked to know they serve Thai food here, because it seemed to be more of a Chinese restaurant from the outside look. Interior decor was on point, perfect with the giant mirror, but the light was pretty weak to have a good picture here. The space is kind of small, not that many tables so if you come at lunch or dinner time, you might have to wait in a line. Last time when we came, we waited for around 15 minutes, but the food was worth it.
We ordered “Khao Soi” and “Braised Beef Noodles”. “Khao Soi” was well seasoned, creamy and savory, sweet enough. “Braised Beef Noodles” tasted okay but not that impressive as I expected.
Service was great, most of the servers were Thai, they had great English. I like their welcoming and helpful attitude.
My boyfriend is really picky towards Thai food but he totally approved this place.
However, the price is a bit high, I feel like it is a bit overpriced.
Worth a comeback."

We started off with the Roti and the Mapo Tofu and both dishes were BANGERS! Then I slurped down the Hot and Sour pork bowl with Shanghai noodles and it was perfect
I am very happy with my experience and totally look forward to visiting again.
Star of the show might have been the $5 Roti, sooooo good!"

Staff are extremely friendly and even gave me a tide stain stick when I couldn't keep the food off my shirt.

If you're a tourist in China Town it's a definite must stop"
Fat Mao Noodles,Asian Fusion,"217 E Georgia Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1Z6 Canada",BC,49.2787559,-123.0989242,5,"Fat Mao Noodles, nestled in the heart of Chinatown, Vancouver, is an unmissable culinary gem. The star of my recent visit was undoubtedly their signature chicken noodles, accompanied with thick, luscious Shanghai wide noodles. The broth was a symphony of flavors, masterfully balanced and seasoned, leaving a rich and savory imprint on the palate. Its taste was enveloping and satisfying, a testament to Fat Mao's nuanced understanding of noodle artistry. Equally impressive was the Thousand Year Egg appetiser; a dish that was fascinatingly complex and yet, astoundingly straightforward. Its texture, the harmony of flavors, everything was an elegant dance that added depth to the overall culinary narrative. The exceptional service was the icing on the cake, making the dining experience as delightful as the food itself. Fat Mao Noodles unquestionably excels in delivering an authentic and satisfying noodle experience that is worth every moment spent there. This is a destination that proves time and again, the transformative power of food when crafted with precision and passion. Highly recommended."
Fat Mao Noodles,Asian Fusion,"217 E Georgia Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1Z6 Canada",BC,49.2787559,-123.0989242,5,"Small hole-in-the-wall shop with fast and friendly service. I made the mistake of snacking before coming here, thinking I'd be fine and it wouldn't be that much food anyways. WRONG! Come here hungry! The food is packed with flavor and is served fresh. Seating is pretty limited so be careful if you have a big party or if you see that it's super busy. I feel bad because I couldn't finish my food nor take it to go since my lodging doesn't have a place for me to store it. I need to come here once more before I fly back home, for sure!"
Fat Mao Noodles,Asian Fusion,"217 E Georgia Street Vancouver, BC V6A 1Z6 Canada",BC,49.2787559,-123.0989242,5,"5/5 service - our server very friendly, never let us run out of water, and took the time to tell us all about their dishes and the history of the restaurant.

5/5 food - we ordered the Spicy Boat Noodles. Quite spicy but not to the point where it takes away from the flavour. Like I said, it’s all about the broth. It’s phenomenal.

3.5/5 vibe - not really coming here for the vibe though. You’re coming here to get a masterfully well balanced bowl of noodles."
Kin Kao Thai Kitchen,Thai,"903 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5L Canada",BC,49.2763842,-123.0698044,4,"I tried the soup and it had a great balance of sourness and spiciness. The pork in the was tender and juicy, and the soup portion size was a little small for my liking. The sauce had a bit of a kick, which some people may find too spicy, but I thought it added a nice flavor to the dish. The fried rice was also good, but I found the sauce to be a little too salty. Overall, I recommend pairing the meal with some water or tea to balance out the flavors."
Kin Kao Thai Kitchen,Thai,"903 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5L Canada",BC,49.2763842,-123.0698044,5,"Kin Kao offers a modern and inviting atmosphere where you can indulge in a remarkable culinary experience.

From the moment you step into Kin Kao, you are transported to a world of delectable Thai cuisine, leaving you craving more of their exceptional offerings."
Kin Kao Thai Kitchen,Thai,"903 Commercial Drive Vancouver, BC V5L Canada",BC,49.2763842,-123.0698044,4,"There are two restaurants. Kin Kao Song on Commercial Drive is the test kitchen and seating is first-come-first-serve. Song on Broadway is the one that requires reservations. I had initially made a mistake by making the reservation at Song (which I thought was Kin Kao). After checking the menu one day prior to the actual meal, I realized that Song did not have some of the menu items I had intended to try. Fortunately, I was able to cancel my reservation in time. We were the first to arrive at Kin Kao on Commercial drive – just to make sure we can get a table. Since I have garlic allergies, there were only specific items we can order. We were able to request no garlic for the Green Papaya Salad. The Chicken Satay does not have garlic in the ingredients. We really wanted fish instead of beef, so, we selected Grilled Fish even though it was marinated with garlic. For carbs, we ordered sticky rice. The Green Papaya was very aggressive. I had a hard time finishing this dish as the dressing was so strong. I did not enjoy the 'fight'. The chicken satay was very tender. We both liked the texture of the grilled fish and did not detect the garlic. Emboldened by that, I ordered a small portion of chicken wings as I was really craving it plus I am not a chicken breast person. That was a mistake. Although the flavour of the chicken wings was interesting, I liked the crispiness and the fact that it was not flour-dipped, the garlic left a disgustingly strong taste in my mouth that I had to live with all night. Although I cold have used some chocolate ice cream to remove the flavour, I did not trust my body to be able to endure the garlic, so we rushed home without stopping for chocolate ice cream. We really enjoyed the sticky rice though. Overall, this place has a more interesting menu than most of the Thai place we've been to. The execution was more creative and fusion. Next time though, I will be sure to selecting items that we not marinated in garlic."

One of the most authentic and best Thai restaurants in Vancouver. The quality of the food is beyond our expectations.  It always spicy umami and delightful flavours.

Portion wise the restaurant was vaso ery generous  tnbend to wife.  Service impeccable. We ordered a spread of green papaya salad, pork jowl skewers, chicken satay, Thai crispy pork belly, drunken noodles, Thai red curry, Thai fermented sausage and iconic mango sticky rice.

Caveman Cafe,Organic Stores,"88 W Pender Street Unit 1005 Vancouver, BC V6B 6N8 Canada",BC,49.2804064,-123.1069714,4,"We ordered 4 dishes:
1) ordered the beet salad which had a picture that showed mostly beets with some cheese and lettuce. However, the item I received was a lot of lettuce with a small amount of beets. The taste was fairly bland. I would rate the salad a 6-7 out of 10.

2) My 8 year old order the personal pizza. The cheese and sauce was delicious but the crust was very different and not good.

3) My husband ordered the Butter Chicken. It was a large amount of food but the taste was average. He rated it an 8 out of 10.

4) My 15 year ordered the Hamburger and loved it. She gave it a 9 out of 10.

It wasn’t too busy on a Sunday afternoon and we found a place to sit inside with no problem. However, it’s not the nicest place in terms of decor and vibe."
Caveman Cafe,Organic Stores,"88 W Pender Street Unit 1005 Vancouver, BC V6B 6N8 Canada",BC,49.2804064,-123.1069714,4,"This place left a very good impression on me. At first, I thought it was just a keto restaurant, but there are also non-keto options and plenty of choices for vegan and GF diets. I don't follow any of these diets, but the person taking my order made sure that I was aware of everything in my order in case I needed to know. He was super friendly! I went back and forth on whether I wanted hummus in my platter and apologized for being indecisive, and he just laughed it off with me.
I had a Tandoori Jackfruit Feast Platter. The feast platters are very customizable: you can choose your protein, sauces, type of rice (basmati or cauliflower), the veggies you want in your salad, and if you want to add any hummus and/or tzatziki dip. I was super happy with the platter I built! The tandoori sauce was as flavourful as I hoped for (and pretty spicy, but that might've just been the jalapeños I added) and the cooling tzatziki went really well with it. It was also very filling!
For dessert, I tried the Keto New York Cheesecake. Mixed experience with this. The cheesecake had a very light texture similar to some no-bake cheesecakes, but with the full-bodied tangy flavour of a baked cheesecake, and I really liked how unique it was. But I think it was frozen in the middle and the biscuit crust was a little dry in a freezer-burnt way. There was a dollop of what looked like whipped cream on top but tasted like and had the thickness of butter, which I had to discard because it was too rich for me and didn’t have any flavour to contribute.
I asked about decaf coffee/espresso when I ordered, and they don’t carry it, but tea was suggested as an alternative, so I ordered a green tea. The bag wasn’t labelled but it tasted like a sencha which is one of my favourites.
Order and pay at the counter and the food is brought to your table. Space is a little tight in the cafe but it’s kind of cozy and I found the atmosphere to be welcoming."

at this taqueria. To be honest….It was okay, I wish they put cilantro and onions to enhance flavours and provided hot sauce, salsa verde etc. Tacos were bland and small. 4 small tacos for $15 was kinda steep. In Winnipeg we can get 3 tacos for $5-$7 and even 3 quesadillas for $8 at BMC Taqueria."

The kids enjoyed the cheese quesadilla (it was huge). We all devoured our tacos. The lengua (beef tongue) was my favourite, it was so flavourful. My husbands favourite was the Chicken Pastor, the onions, cilantro and sauce make for the perfect bite. The meal for the 5 of us came to just over $70.  We all left very full.  We love the location as well, you get to sit inside and people watch or sit at their outside street patio. Now that it is summer they should add some umbrellas to their outdoor seating to make it more comfortable under the sun.  It is definitely our favourite new restaurant in our neighbourhood."

One thing that was a bit odd was that the staff came over and said they need the table in the next 1.5 hours. Not a big deal but the food came out slow , by the time it arrived we only had 45 min to eat . I didn't really enjoy the feeling of being rushed to eat and leave .

The soup of the day, and not to mention the French toast which was my favourite, immediately raised our expectations for the rest of the meals. The seared scallop was delicious and light. I like how the rice that came with it has a lot of veggies and a spark of spiciness and juiciness when bit into. The pork belly was cooked so well that it was crispy and the fat just melted in my mouth like a dream. It will take too long to describe every dish but every dish didn’t disappoint and this is the type of food that you could feel the chef’s ingenuity and creativity. We were really pleased. It is a rather small restaurant but definitely a hidden gem."

The interior is very modern and nice. So if you are interested to taste a Ukrainian food prepared with some modern flavour then this is one of the best places to go in Vancouver.  You can also purchase some very nice bread and home made cookies there as well!"

The restaurant is busy but not too full (reservations available), the staff are quite friendly, the food is very pleasant and the atmosphere is comfortable.

We had the chicken kyiv and cabbage rolls (the rolls were juicy and stoodout most).

The real showstopper was the bakery! So fresh and delicious. We really enjoyed the double chocolate chip cookie, the pistachio chocolate chip cookie and the BABKA dark chocolate slice. Absolutely delightful. We will get the full babka loaf for a family special occasion!"

I was in the mood for some flavorful and authentic Indian cuisine, and this restaurant did not disappoint.

The menu at Indian Delicacy Restaurant offers a wide range of dishes, including vegetarian and non-vegetarian options.

Overall, I would recommend Indian Delicacy Restaurant to anyone looking for tasty and authentic Indian cuisine in Vancouver. The food is excellent, the service is friendly, and the location near the Pinnacle Harbourfront Vancouver makes it a convenient spot for visitors to the city.

People please if you like Indian , please , please go here . It’s delicious.I’d travel 17 hrs all the way From Saskatchewan again to taste more of the items on their menu. We were there for lunch and needed to be in and out so had the buffet. Standard dishes as in most restaurants, but they come out on top for quality and taste .and one one more thing that no other restaurant in down town Vancouver can touch. And that was the price 20$ lunch buffet . Can you imagine that . Think about it people average parking lot in downtown Van is 16-25$ for the time you need to run around and do your business. Value for your cash is definitely there. Go enjoy you won’t be disappointed, except you picky people. You can’t be helped lol

Indian Delicacy,Indian,"1130 West pender st Vancouver, BC V6E 4A4 Canada",BC,49.2874837,-123.1216012,4,"Amazing value in the middle of downtown. It's all you can eat for $20 and they include some garlic naan, I go to taste a variety of Indian dishes.
The value was there, but quality was a little lacking. Food was a little greasy, garlic naan wasn't great, butter chicken was dry and flavour was average. The fried potatoes were good, Tandoori chicken was cooked well but also was lacking in flavour.
Everything was mild in spice, which is to be expected because everyone is taking from the same buffet tray."

The food is absolutely delicious, with a menu that offers plenty of options to choose from. But what really sets this restaurant apart is the atmosphere - it's the perfect spot to catch up with friends over a meal and drinks. The staff are friendly and welcoming. Overall, I highly recommend checking out this restaurant for a memorable dining experience in Vancouver."
Cactus Club Cafe,Canadian (New),"1085 Canada Place Vancouver, BC V6C 3E1 Canada",BC,49.2894022,-123.1180433,3,"I recently dined at Cactus Club Restaurant and wanted to share my thoughts. Although there was a delay in receiving our food, the staff was incredibly friendly and made us feel welcome throughout our visit. The restaurant itself had a great ambiance and provided a pleasant environment for our meal.
One area of improvement would be the selection of non-alcoholic drinks, which was somewhat limited. It would be nice to see a wider variety of options in that regard. On the other hand, I must commend the kitchen on the fantastic calamari. It was cooked to perfection and had a delicious flavor that left me wanting more.
However, I found the ravioli with shrimp to be a bit too sweet for my taste. While it may appeal to those who enjoy sweeter flavors, I personally would have preferred a more balanced taste.
Overall, my experience at Cactus Club Restaurant was positive, with the standout being the delightful calamari. Despite the minor setbacks, I would still recommend visiting for a friendly atmosphere and memorable dining experience."

The staff was very kind and the food was great, though my chicken sandwich was better than the tofu bowl (which lacked sauce and was a bit dry). Really good fries! The cocktail menu was large and the cocktails themselves were very tasty, too.

While the views were lovely, the restaurant was VERY loud and it could be difficult to hear the person sitting across from you!"

I had salmon for dinner and it was delicious. I sat in the dining room with a water view. Most people wore sunglasses because the sun was bright and bold at 8pm at night! My waiter was awesome. I wish I remembered his name. It’s a crowed place, so make reservations early. They have outside eating and since it’s right on the water side, it’s a great place to take a stroll afterwards."

We tried their Rise + Shine and butter chicken pie along with flat white. It was delicious. Tried Australian pies for the first time and loved them.
Definitely a must try."
Peaked Pies,Australian,"975 Denman Street Vancouver, BC V6G Canada",BC,49.2897,-123.1384318,5,"Love this place! This is the only place I know of in Vancouver that does Australian food which is very cool. They have many choices for meat pies but also a few great options for vegetarians - the vegetarian Mentil Lentil pie and vegan Vegetable Medley pie (had this one at the other location but the experience at both seems consistent) are both delicious and hearty. Although the pies are premade and heated when you order, they taste fresh and flakey out of the oven. The pies are definitely the highlight, but the desserts aren't bad. The miningtons are a great light dessert with a lovely balance between the thin chocolate coating and fluffy sponge cake. The other dessert I've tried, the vanilla slice, is one of those desserts that's just indulgently sweet, but that was what my heart desired when I ordered, so I was happy with it. I haven't tried the espresso drinks because they don't have decaf, but I'm happy with their teas - the chai latte and London fog are very good even if they're a little on the sweet side for my taste. The prices are fair, certainly cheaper than the same meal would likely be at a full-service restaurant, but pretty much just as good."
La Taqueria Pinche Taco Shop,Mexican,"322 W Hastings Street Vancouver, BC V8B 1K6 Canada",BC,49.2829621,-123.1105621,3,Price point definitely higher than average. Burrito lacks core flavours critical to Mexican and Latin American cuisine. Meat chunks are a bit dry/hard with the lack of salsa and sour cream. Pico de gallo is barely there. No option for hot sauce. The overall flavour is flat/plain with an overwhelming amount of rice and lack of the rest.

We tried their special of the day, fish, chicken and beef tacos. Our favourite were the fish and the special of the day. They were absolutely amazing! We ordered all of them at the same time but I would recommend getting tacos as you eat as they taste best fresh! It’s a must try if you are in Vancouver!"
Little Jumbo,Canadian (New),"506 Fort Street Suite 102 Victoria, BC V8W 1E6 Canada",BC,48.42527,-123.36928,5,"Excellent bar with sophisticated cocktails. Perfect fancy date night bar. As a tourist, I went out of my way to find a non-tourist cocktail bar and they delivered. They have an eclectic and extensive assortment of spirits. Knowing it was dedicated to historic bar masters I had high hopes, but it truly exceeded my expectations. Anytime I'm back in Victoria I'll be visiting again."
Little Jumbo,Canadian (New),"506 Fort Street Suite 102 Victoria, BC V8W 1E6 Canada",BC,48.42527,-123.36928,3,"Good, not great. The menu didn’t match what was posted on their website so we showed up and were immediately disappointed.

We got the tuna tar tar which was fine and split the burger, which was also fine (buns should be toasted on a $30 burger).

GF got the marshmallow drink, she described it as having a strange flavor combination

It was an average dining experience with above average cost."
Little Jumbo,Canadian (New),"506 Fort Street Suite 102 Victoria, BC V8W 1E6 Canada",BC,48.42527,-123.36928,4,Nice cocktails and friendly service. Would have loved to try their tartare but they ran out. The mushroom pate was delicious -earthy and rich. The vongole was not what I expected but was a delicious balance of tomatoes and clam flavour. The seafood soup with the fish was wonderful -the fish was not just poached but panseared so it still had a nice crust. Mussels and clams were fresh and juicy.
Little Jumbo,Canadian (New),"506 Fort Street Suite 102 Victoria, BC V8W 1E6 Canada",BC,48.42527,-123.36928,4,"Excellent service and good quality meals. They specialize in a few dishes so chocies are limited, the reason for only 4 stars is that we went for dinner and they ran out of spaghetti and steak which was what I wanted and the expensive cocktails are tiny! I almost started chuckling when I received my Mononoke, pretty much a fancy shot for $20. Somethings on their menu are justified with the prices (like the wagyu beef burger!) but definitely not the cocktails nor the tuna tartare (very small amount of tuna with filler). Took almost 50 mins to get out burgers but service was top notch and atmosphere was decent, not as romantic as other reviews mebtioned, especially when it's busy!"
Little Jumbo,Canadian (New),"506 Fort Street Suite 102 Victoria, BC V8W 1E6 Canada",BC,48.42527,-123.36928,5,"Came here to celebrate me taking my nursing exam. This place is the bomb!! We shared the little Jumbo burger which was soooooo good. It comes with Parmesan fries. We also had the short rib which was some of the best I've had. The meat was very soft and fatty and I loved the unique flavors it was paired with. There were blueberries, deep fried polenta, and I think some mayo. It was so good!!!

The ambience inside is super nice and intimate. We sat at the bar and had the pleasure of chatting with the bartender Clayton who was so so nice. I had a lemonade but my boyfriend had a very smokey mai tai cocktail which was really good. Will definitely come back!"

The hour or so we waited for our food was well worth the wait and this place’s hype is well earned. Small hiccup when the staff got our order wrong but it’s understandable.

Easily one of the best fish and chips I’ve ever had. You need to get the chowder as well."
Red Fish Blue Fish,Fish & Chips,"1006 Wharf Street Victoria, BC V8W 1T4 Canada",BC,48.4243421,-123.3705879,4,"The food was excellent. We had tacones, chowder and the (misnamed) cod dog.
Soup was delicious, not a traditional clam chowder and all the better for that. Tacones were well balanced with fish fillings cooked just right. The battered cod in a fresh roll with tartar, pickles and slaw was tasty. Chips/fries were really good: crispy outside and fluffy centres.
The meal was definitely fair value for money.
Long line up for counter service style ordering though, we waited nearly 30 minutes to order (hence the 4 star rating). But once we ordered the food came up pretty quickly with none of this sitting around under heat lamps.
Worth the wait. Delicious meal. And very filling, we couldn't finish it all."
Red Fish Blue Fish,Fish & Chips,"1006 Wharf Street Victoria, BC V8W 1T4 Canada",BC,48.4243421,-123.3705879,5,"Open air take-out style Fish & Chip shop that offers more than just deep fried items.  Grilled salmon is moist and flavourful, and the seared tuna is generous in portion size. Fresh local ingredients paired with friendly staff, what's not to love? Meal times are usually busy, but the food is worth the 30 min line up for order (then about 10 min for freshly made food)."
Red Fish Blue Fish,Fish & Chips,"1006 Wharf Street Victoria, BC V8W 1T4 Canada",BC,48.4243421,-123.3705879,5,Neat little food truck by the harbour. There is always a line up all day long.  The Fish & Chip is delicious. Crispy but not oily. The chipotle coconut chowder is very tasty. We were lucky to get a table with a view of the harbour.

Nubo Japanese Tapas,Sushi Bars,"739 Pandora Avenue Victoria, BC V8W 1N9 Canada",BC,48.4276915,-123.3634927,5,"I rarely provide 5 star reviews due to something always being off. Whether that be the food, service, or the environment. But this was impeccable. Very rarely did you find such fluidity and cooperation between serving staff and the kitchen.

The food was very delicious and surprisingly quick. Having fast service is usually a red flag for me, wondering if the food was fresh or made with quality, but without a doubt, it was made well.

Our waitress was very polite and nice to talk with. She always responded to our ""thank you"" with a ""you're welcome"" she had the perfect balance of attention and checkups to not annoy people with constant checks but didn't leave you wondering if you were going to be served. It was the perfect balance.

The restaurant is small, which does make the noise travel quite far, on the louder side, but being at the bar was a saving grace as volume seemed to be lower there.

All in all it was a very nice experience and the next time we are in Victoria we will definitely be returning for another meal."

Our group sampled a mix of classic and modern rolls with atypical flavors, as well as several small plates. The maguro tartare with taro chips was quite lovely, as well as the kara-age, which was incredibly juicy and tender. Drinks were well balanced and the servers all phenomenal."
Nubo Japanese Tapas,Sushi Bars,"739 Pandora Avenue Victoria, BC V8W 1N9 Canada",BC,48.4276915,-123.3634927,4,"This place is bustling! Expect a wait for dinner time. It will take some time to get a seat, order and get the bill as I experienced. So come with a patient attitude. Otherwise the waiters/resses  have their hands very full.

Otherwise the food is great! My favorite dish was the tomato curry karage. The curry was mildly sweet and they were generous with the karate. I also recommend the Tofino - an assortment of scallop, shrimp and white fish tempura.  It was absolutely delicious: crispy on the outside and so flavorful and tender in the inside."

We were welcomed at the entrance with very pleasant professional personnel.  I was immediately impressed with the ambiance - it feels like a restaurant in Greece. Very spacious with lovely artwork and blue/white look everywhere.

Dimitri assisted us with our order - we loved all the appetizers, dinner, wine and the best part was the spectacular service and attention to details.

We’ve eaten at many Greek restaurants over the years which meet our expectations however this one went above and beyond.

I took the trio platter to try a little of everything. I did expect more for the price ($15) however, it was very tasty. I would recommend to just go with a full dish instead of the trio, you get more for your money. Finishing touch, a nice espresso. I will be back."

Everything is perfectly curated. Beef carpaccio is love at every bite, same with gambas al ajillo. Even the baguette and the focaccia bread as sides to the meals were fresh and delicious. Portions are fair for the price. Wine list is pretty good, the few wines we had were great. Even the Sherry list is pretty good if you’re into that. Service is awesome, and finally the atmosphere is really nice. Cool lighting inside, and a beautiful open bar."

Fishhook,Seafood,"805 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8W 1H6 Canada",BC,48.4241523,-123.3621483,5,"Indian-French bistro with SOUL FOOD! I.e. food that is so nourishing and full of flavour, it comforts your soul 🫰I couldn’t pick a favourite but would definitely suggest the mussels and fisherman’s chowder.

Also, if you’re like my husband and are hardcore about tasting the potato flavour in fries, better to think of the fishhook poutine as a curry with fries in it - the curry is thick and luxurious and flavourful, but it was too saucy for his expectations 😂 would still recommend though, it was delicious!"

There are combination of spices, flavors, and impeccable service will keep me coming back for more. You need to try the hot pot is absolutely amazing.

We had it on our to-do list on our Victoria visit. We were glad to make it there for lunch just before our return trip from Victoria. Fishhook went beyond our expectations. We had ordered the Biriyani and The Pondicherry. The flavours were unique and perfectly blended. Never before had we loved salmon so much.
Looking forward to our next visit."

Blue Fox Cafe,Breakfast & Brunch,"919 Fort Street Suite 101 Victoria, BC V8V 3K3 Canada",BC,48.42365,-123.35877,5,Amazing breakfast spot in Downtown Victoria. When we go early in the morning already had line up so can see how popular it is. It’s featured in so many articles about the breakfast you have to try in Victoria. Actually at beginning we are little skeptical but it turns out it’s very good. The portion is huge and they are generous on putting ingredients the plates are full :). We are super full after eating that we skip the lunch. We highly recommend this to if you want to try traditional breakfast in this beautiful city

The food was very yummy and very large portions for the price, I would definitely recommend. One plate would’ve honestly been enough for both my friend and I. The decor and ambience is also very nice, service is quite attentive. Although a tad slow because of how busy they were. I would definitely come again."

It's a busy spot but the service was efficient and the food came out quickly.  I had the Angel Eyes Eggs Benny.  The eggs were perfectly cooked.  The homefries were crispy.  Didn't find it had oodles of flavour, but of course that has more to do with my choice of order.  My friend had the Moroccan Chicken Club which he really liked.  Will go back, but likely not when it's lined up."

We ordered Kung Pao Tofu and Special Fried Rice, both the dishes were delicious. For Kung Pao Tofu, one would imagine that Tofu was the star of the dish (which it was), but for me it was the crispy fried broccoli which took the dish to another level.. chefs kiss !!
Food quantity and the service was pretty good. I can't wait to go back and try other things on their menu.

This place is a must visit if you are in Victoria."
Foo,Asian Fusion,"769 Yates Street Victoria, BC V8W 1L6 Canada",BC,48.4256723,-123.3625316,5,"Definitely recommend!  Just what we needed on a rainy afternoon.  They totally delivered on the street food promise with the bonus of getting out of the rain.  Red Curry reminded me a lot of actual curry in Thailand - lots of different veggies and a rich, not overpowering curry flavors.  Really good food!"

The people there are very friendly and will consider go back on our next visit!
I personally recommend the Caramel Chicken when visiting this place. Good luck!"
Foo,Asian Fusion,"769 Yates Street Victoria, BC V8W 1L6 Canada",BC,48.4256723,-123.3625316,4,"The crispy ginger pork was an explosion of flavor in my mouth. I would definitely recommend it. The spice level was just right for me.

My wife got the famous caramel chicken which she enjoyed. Both dishes are delicious. The potstickers though were just average fried pork dumplings. Their meat serving  was plentiful that we had to ask for a to go box for some leftovers.

Prices were reasonable considering it already includes taxes. Service was fast."
Foo,Asian Fusion,"769 Yates Street Victoria, BC V8W 1L6 Canada",BC,48.4256723,-123.3625316,5,"We decided to try Foo Asian Street Food for dinner and it was phenomenal! We got the Saag Paneer, which is served with fry bread and streamed rice. The Tofu Kung Pao bowl is a medley of vegetables that comes with steamed rice. Both dishes were flavourful, delicious and well-done! They have a great menu as well. Love their concept! Excellent and friendly service from the host as well. Thank you! Highly recommend!

Not only it was a great experience of serving ourselves the noodle mix, the taste is incredible. The waitress is also very nice, very fast service.

Their pork ribs is also a must try, and their pork belly is also good.

Definitely coming back when visiting victoria & its chinatown."
Little Yunnan Restaurant,Asian Fusion,"546 Fisgard St Victoria, BC V8W 1R4 Canada",BC,48.4294829,-123.3678964,4,Nice restaurant located in Victoria Chinatown near the Fan Tan Alley. Their feature is cross bright noodle soup from Yunnan. To be honest not the worst but not the best either. Feels like the soup base add a lot MSG because very savoury. The portion is not big each ingredient like only one or two bites. Noodle doesn’t feel fresh it’s pre-cooked. If just for simple dinner that’s okay but don’t expect too much fancy.

Guess it’s part of the fun to put small plates of a variety of meat and veggies into the boiling chicken broth in a sensible order and let the final cooking be done right in front of you. The rich broth with fresh ingredients and smooth rice noodles couldn’t be more satisfying and heart warming. The tofu and kelp salad side dishes were tasty as well.

I was not expecting much, but it was absolutely delicious. The fried dumplings are absolutely exquisite, and the wifi and service was even better. It was a fast,simple, delicious dine-in-dinner in ChinaTown, and I loved it. There was only one waitress working, and while it took a while for the menus to arrive, the food came very quick, and anyone who doesn't go here is missing out. Great design, great everything!"

Make sure to make a reservation so you get a great table.
We had the chicken and mussels,  I feel it was a mistake. Should have stuck with one theme. Either seafood. Or no seafood.
The chicken was very very good.
I’d have it again."

The restaurant is very big. There was a section with a bar with a younger ground, another sections with larger groups and family and then another area that seemed to be more intimate. Everything that we ordered was delicious- gnocchi, lasagna, and pumpkin cheesecake. Highly recommend the pumpkin cheesecake (without the apple compote and lemon-those flavours didnt go well together for my palate) I would say it’s the best I’ve had. Service was great. I would definitely go back!"

Came in for an app and aperol spritz. Excellent atmosphere. Food was good, fresh and unique. They had a mix up with their bar order so they were out of Prosecco, which is fine..sh!t happens! Def coming back!"

Took my boyfriend here for the first time and he absolutely loved it. We both got drinks which were good. We shared a calamari which was a little bit small for $20. My boyfriend has the steak and he likes it done rare and he was so happy with how it turned out. I had the fish and chips and the fish was so crispy and very good. I will add the fries are not good, they are very soggy. Will come back but I would love to see the fries change."

We had a nice place outside, in the shade and with a fresh breeze and our waiter was extraordinarily friendly and courteous.

The dishes, the burger as well as the fish, tasted delicious, were nicely plated and a good size. The self-made drinks were very tasty as well.

The experience overall was great in any case, the atmosphere was very harmonious, the dishes tasted superb and were worth their price."

Burger is juicy and tasty.

It came with burnt, refried-tasting fries.

I am sensitive to re-used oil. The calamari wasn't only greasy but also smelled like it was cooked in re-used oil.

The service is good though.  I was attended frequently and welcomed well."

All the dishes were amazing, packed with large chunks of seafood and were really good portions, especially for sharing! My favourites are the lobster and crab salad (large enough for 2-3), the lobster and crab French toast, lobster roll, and last but not least, the brioche French toast! The French toast is so good it should be illegal, especially at only $10. As a Victoria local, I am always trying different restaurants in town and I have to say this place is one of the best. Don’t miss this place the next time you are in Victoria!"

I was not impressed with the quality of the food. We ordered a half original fried chicken, a half sweet and sour, assorted fries (regular fries, yam fries, and onion rings), and the spicy chicken soup. The chicken that we ordered was warm and super dry. The meat was not tender at all, you can tell it's been sitting in the back for a bit. The fries were alright, it was also dry and oily, not much salt to it. The spicy chicken soup was good but a bit too spicy for our taste. The service was good, our servers were super nice and accommodating."
Chimac Korean Pub & Fried Chicken,Korean,"512 Yates Street Victoria, BC V8W 2Z6 Canada",BC,48.4270939,-123.3698779,3,"I have been to Chimac a few times now and to be completely honest, it’s ok. Their Fire Gopchang (Beef Intestines) is really good! I would definitely recommend that if you’re willing to try something new. Although sometimes when I order it it’s grainy which happens sometimes. The nice thing about Chimac is that they have a lot of different flavours to choose from for their Chicken. The only reason why I think it’s ok is because the chicken isn’t as crispy as it once was. However, I do like their Boneless Padak because of the pile of green onions that comes with it. I wouldn’t recommend getting the Fish Cake Soup as it’s quite bland. The Seafood Udon is ok but I wouldn’t order it again. I just feel like there are better places for Chicken but if you are Downtown and are craving Korean Fried Chicken here’s an option."

Not the tastiest but it's okay. Big portion, too! 😂

Chimac Korean Pub & Fried Chicken,Korean,"512 Yates Street Victoria, BC V8W 2Z6 Canada",BC,48.4270939,-123.3698779,2,"Pa dak was not good for us.  Firstly they did not have boneless chicken available, so they offered bone-in chicken as an alternative. The chicken lacked the desired crispiness, and the batter was a bit bland. Additionally, the sauce had an unpleasant taste, reminiscent of nail polish, so we decided to return it after sampling just one piece. Despite this, we were still charged for the entire dish.

On a positive note, the dumplings and assorted fries were delicious, providing the only redeeming aspect of the meal."
Chimac Korean Pub & Fried Chicken,Korean,"512 Yates Street Victoria, BC V8W 2Z6 Canada",BC,48.4270939,-123.3698779,4,"Quite underwhelming if you are looking for korean fried chicken, the chicken is not very crispy and there was entirely too much green onion in the dish, although the meat was very tender. We also got the pork stew and that was pretty delicious in terms of the pork being stewed properly and fell apart. I did not feel like the broth was very authentic tasting though and there was a lot of pepper.
The resturant is quite busy and there is a waitlist for spots if it is a weekend. The service is not bad, although they did run out of rice when I wanted to order some to go. Overall not bad, but I wouldn't come here for the chicken."

Very reasonably priced, well worth the food alone. Add to that dining a 10 minute walk along the harbour from the center of the tourist district, efficient service and very comfortable seating in a historic house. We arrived a few minutes before opening at 9am, with about five groups in line in front of us and were seated 10 minutes later. We finished breakfast and were out the door before 10am.

My daughter loved the Ramen Tofu back then and this started her journey exploring different types of food. For Muslims: don’t let the pig on the door turn you off: the vegan vegetarian dishes are incredible. Our whole family loves the vegan/ Vegetarian Tan Tan Men. The tofu is crunchy and delicious. I wholeheartedly recommend Bao. I look forward to it all year and it is a big reason why we all love coming to Victoria so much.

It was more of a pho with rice noodles however it was so delicious. Spicy and lots of different textures. Very generous portion sizes and a very fair price. Food came very quickly. I had the tan tan Ramen and iced Vietnamese coffee. Absolutely loved it! Went with my brother and we both agreed it was fabulous!

Decided to try a couple of their baos during our stay in Victoria. Ordered Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Chinese BBQ, Mala 5 Mushroom, and the Taiwanese Classic (from left to right). It was 4 for $16. They were cute tiny baos, good for an appetizer and the flavors were on point. I wished they were full sized though! The Mala 5 mushroom had a good spicy kick to it."

What a disappointment. The bao buns we tried were Taiwanese Classic, Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Mala 5 Mushroom. The classic was the best flavour and it was just okay, the rest were bad. The Tan Tan Men was just bad, could barely eat it. And the Kara Miso Ramen was subpar, something about it was off. The Vietnamese ice coffee on the otherhand was yummy. You seat yourself and pay at the counter when you arrive, so there isn’t much service. Overall not nearly close to the 4.5 rating it has on google more like a 3.0."

My friends and I were thrilled we did!  We shared the Today's Best Things, which consisted of a watermelon salad so could you could take a bath in it, the Duck Bolognese with homemade pasta, tender duck and an incredible sauce, Beets with dandilion greens. Omg. The flavors, the spice, perfection, and a steak that was perfection with a salad that I could eat, literally, every single day.  Dessert was a cornbread cake with blueberries, piatachios, and some kind of cream cheesy whipped creamy pillow that sealed the deal.

A+ 1000% reccommend, and we are so sad its a six hour trip to get back there!

Tiny place, excellent service, cool, chill atmosphere.

Thank you for the incredible meal!"

A stripped down, almost unrefined atmosphere stands confidently in the awareness that its' dark cathedral walls host a different kind of church.
These guys are an absolute thrill to watch in their element as they dance around their tiny, open kitchen, slinging seriously excellent food and drink into the mouths of worship.
Well don chaps!

Note that it's small (3-4 tables and about 8 bar seats so resos are recommended), the food is made from scratch in front of you so expect a bit of a wait. I can't believe that my plate was only $25, this was a gourmet execution of a simple concept, and it was big enough to serve 2!

Apparently the Victoria foodie scene is really good and Hank's is one of the places that you need to go to."
Jam Cafe,Breakfast & Brunch,"542 Herald Street Victoria, BC V8W 1S5 Canada",BC,48.4303785,-123.3677163,5,"Get ready for the hyperbole that isn't. The Blackstone Benny was by far the best eggs Benedict I have ever had. The bacon alone is worth 5 stars.
The service was top notch and it's fun to just look around in this restaurant. Go and you will see what I mean."
Jam Cafe,Breakfast & Brunch,"542 Herald Street Victoria, BC V8W 1S5 Canada",BC,48.4303785,-123.3677163,5,"Great food! Huge sizes! We tried different things pork belly eggs Benedict, veggie bowl and french toast and they were all awesome!
Eggs Benedict are great and big for one person, but I would say bowls are for two, they're huge!
French toast is a mots I would say, we tried the apple one and it was unbelievable!
The waiting times are a bit long but I would say they are worth it. It would be better if you could write your name down and come back, but still is good.
Buttermilk biscuits are very good and special too.
Definitely a great place for breakfast/brunch!"
Jam Cafe,Breakfast & Brunch,"542 Herald Street Victoria, BC V8W 1S5 Canada",BC,48.4303785,-123.3677163,5,"Great service and great food! I tried John's Place, Blue Fox Cafe, and Jam Cafe in the span of 3 days. Service and menus were great at all 3. With a similar type of cuisine, you can't go wrong with any of the 3 places.
We tried the Herald Omlette and the later tater bowl at Jam and both were great. I liked the seating at Jam cafe, as well as the Chicken Apple Sausage! Id recommend any of the 3 places for breakfast/brunch, but go early or you're waiting in line for a while."
Jam Cafe,Breakfast & Brunch,"542 Herald Street Victoria, BC V8W 1S5 Canada",BC,48.4303785,-123.3677163,5,"Great breakfast place I got waffles and sausage patties. So good.  Everything our table got was delicious as were the drinks. Very popular there were about 10 ppl in line ahead of us but we only waited about 15 minutes.  We sat outside, they had blankets for the customers to put on their laps. I thought that was so thoughtful. Would definitely go back if in the area."
Jam Cafe,Breakfast & Brunch,"542 Herald Street Victoria, BC V8W 1S5 Canada",BC,48.4303785,-123.3677163,4,"I LOVE their pancakes, their bowls are great too! Jam is a breakfast fave amongst my friends and I. Only downside is the restaurant is small, tables are close together, and you almost always have to line up for a long tome to get a table. If you have the time, I do really recommend it because it’s worth it."
Superbaba,Middle Eastern,"1325 Blanshard Street Victoria, BC V8W 0B5 Canada",BC,48.4266911,-123.3615715,5,"I stopped at Superbaba for lunch, and it didn’t disappoint. They make fresh pita breads daily, and that’s key. You can see them baking the bread in a hot oven. The pita bread is soft and slightly chewy. I got the falafel wrap, and it was delicious. The chickpea fritters were crispy. I enjoyed the fresh and crunchy vegetables in the wrap. The flavours are exquisite. I love their aesthetics with modern flair.

Additionally, I also decided to try the turmeric cookie. Along with the turmeric, I appreciated the rose water. The rose water adds a distinct and unique floral which, in my opinion, is very unique. The cookie had a good texture, with a slightly crisp outer shell and a soft and chewy middle. Highly recommend. Next time, I shall order ahead."
Superbaba,Middle Eastern,"1325 Blanshard Street Victoria, BC V8W 0B5 Canada",BC,48.4266911,-123.3615715,5,Chicken Wrap with two extra falafel balls on the side. Definitely filling a niche that needs filled and I’m so glad it’s around whenever I need it! Thanks!
Superbaba,Middle Eastern,"1325 Blanshard Street Victoria, BC V8W 0B5 Canada",BC,48.4266911,-123.3615715,2,"I had a chicken wrap last week and it was not awful taste. It was full of cabbage and hardly find chicken inside though it was chicken wrap. Instead chicken I got too much fries.
Hope will take care next time."
Superbaba,Middle Eastern,"1325 Blanshard Street Victoria, BC V8W 0B5 Canada",BC,48.4266911,-123.3615715,5,Ordered the spicy falafel bowl for lunch. It took a bit of time but was worth the wait. Fantastic flavour and a good slow burn when finished. Add this to the go-to list for lunch! Next time I'll order ahead.
Superbaba,Middle Eastern,"1325 Blanshard Street Victoria, BC V8W 0B5 Canada",BC,48.4266911,-123.3615715,5,"There is a reason this restaurant is always busy. So delicious! I only wish they would ask if you need a fork when getting food to go because I assume it’s in there & then end up eating my salad/chicken bowl with my fingers @ the park 🤓 tasty tuom, pita chips and ice cream sandwich & also love the lemonade. I will never tire of the sauerkraut pickles & blackened chicken. YUM"
Chorizo & Co,Spanish,"807 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8W 1H6 Canada",BC,48.4241398,-123.3620667,5,"This Mediterranean styled tapa bistro seems to be a hidden gem at a time when many sub-standard restaurants are requiring paid reservations and add restrictions to your time to enjoy being out. Not here. Rich flavoured food, and a great selections of drinks. We had the grilled cauliflower, grilled Humboldt squid, special spot prawn dumplings, dry aged chorizo (it’s in the name - just order some!) and churros. He had a couple HH wines for $6 and cocktails. This is a restaurant you should put on repeat!"
Chorizo & Co,Spanish,"807 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8W 1H6 Canada",BC,48.4241398,-123.3620667,5,"Great food. I had a grilled Humboldt squid and  roasted potatoes for starter. The grilled Humboldt squid was terrific, neither chewey nor too fishy at all. The starter with potatoes was also great. Staff was kind. Want to try other dishes on my next visit."
Chorizo & Co,Spanish,"807 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8W 1H6 Canada",BC,48.4241398,-123.3620667,5,"The food was exceptional. Olives, fancy potatoes, meatballs, paella, scallops, and an assortment of deserts. Everything was remarkable and sooo tasty!  The prices were completely reasonable and the service was right on time.
10/10 - will definitely come again."
Chorizo & Co,Spanish,"807 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8W 1H6 Canada",BC,48.4241398,-123.3620667,5,"What a find !! Super delicious little restaurant with great service. Excellent wine selection with a couple of very good Spanish white wines. Paloma cocktail was excellent. We had salt cod, croquettes, the meatball, grilled bread, and anchovies. Everything was so good. So nice to have things not slathered in cream and cheese. The meatballs were like a soft cloud - so delicious. Nothing over-salted and no heavy sauces …amazing."
Chorizo & Co,Spanish,"807 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8W 1H6 Canada",BC,48.4241398,-123.3620667,5,Thé paella was sooo good. The seafood was seasoned perfectly and fresh. I loved the sauce on the rice and it brought me back to Spain. The owner (man at the Bar?) was also super friendly. We sat in front in the patio and had a lovely dinner. I would definitely come again to try their other tapas!
Aura Waterfront Restaurant + Patio,Seafood,"680 Montreal Street Victoria, BC V8V 1Z8 Canada",BC,48.4235302,-123.3766889,3,"The quality of food and service  is pretty good, for sure.
But the portion is smaller than smaller. Also, I’m not a fan of the coffee (written as espresso but served as normal black coffee), a lot of spaces for improvement."
Aura Waterfront Restaurant + Patio,Seafood,"680 Montreal Street Victoria, BC V8V 1Z8 Canada",BC,48.4235302,-123.3766889,5,Great Western omelette and Aura Benedict! We enjoyed our stay in the hotel as well as our breakfast at Aura waterfront restaurant. We were also with 3 toddlers and they were kept busy with the provided drawing supplies which was nice.
Aura Waterfront Restaurant + Patio,Seafood,"680 Montreal Street Victoria, BC V8V 1Z8 Canada",BC,48.4235302,-123.3766889,5,"Spent a lovely night with good friends/fellow chefs thanks to the aura for supplying a amazing dining experience. The food was some best I've ever had in my life. Especially the tuna and the pork belly. Muah 👌. The plates are were all small and shared between two people yet by the end I was stuffed despite a big appetite. To conclude, for the price of only 65$ per person and eating such delectable food till a full belly I'd definitely recommend either this menu or single plates off it."
Aura Waterfront Restaurant + Patio,Seafood,"680 Montreal Street Victoria, BC V8V 1Z8 Canada",BC,48.4235302,-123.3766889,5,"The Aura benny taste really good!

10 Acres Commons,Seafood,"620 Humboldt Street Victoria, BC V8W 1A4 Canada",BC,48.4228855,-123.3678035,5,"One of the best places to enjoy a casual meal at Commons. We enjoyed tacos, wine, beer and cocktails during the happy hour. The menu may be limited but pretty ok for the price and happy hours. Chicken tacos are delicious. Flat breads are perfectly made and a good enough portion for a quick snack. The house wines, red and white are average but not too bad for the price.

The place has nice modern funky decor so won't feel the place as a boring restaurant. Fun place overall for happy hour"
10 Acres Commons,Seafood,"620 Humboldt Street Victoria, BC V8W 1A4 Canada",BC,48.4228855,-123.3678035,4,"I can’t give it a five star review because they messed up my daughter’s sushi and put onions all over it when we had very specifically ordered it plain. Then they didn’t ask if we wanted another one…She sort of just asked if we could pick the onions off and walked away. Also, I ordered my steak rare, and it came very medium if not well done. Food was pretty good though, especially the field greens, which seemed extremely fresh! My bloody Mary was also very very tasty."
10 Acres Commons,Seafood,"620 Humboldt Street Victoria, BC V8W 1A4 Canada",BC,48.4228855,-123.3678035,4,"The location of this restaurant is great. I went with my 12 year old daughter. We ordered the clam chowder, calamari and tuna salad. The clam chowder and calamari were good. The tuna was dry and the potatoes undercooked. And strangely, at the end of our meal the server asked us if we wanted separate bills which made us think, how common is it that a 40 year old and their 12 year old friend dine there and pay separately?"
10 Acres Commons,Seafood,"620 Humboldt Street Victoria, BC V8W 1A4 Canada",BC,48.4228855,-123.3678035,5,"Good ceviche, a bit pricey. The prawn tacos were amazing. The meat tacos were really good but we preferred the prawn ones. The drinks are always 👌 the server gave us more chips for the ceviche, which is great"

The Fish Store,Seafood Markets,"1 Dallas Road Victoria, BC V8V 0B2 Canada",BC,48.423,-123.38349,4,"These were the best muscles ive ever had in my life. They were sweet and flavorful and not a tiny grain of sand in the entire thing. Absolutely worth $19. The halibut tacos were also fantastic. The halibut fish and chips was the disappointment of the group but still okay.
I would absolutely go back for the muscles and might even come back before our trip is over. Highly recommend.
I would give 5/5 but I just don't give 5s for hardly anything."
The Fish Store,Seafood Markets,"1 Dallas Road Victoria, BC V8V 0B2 Canada",BC,48.423,-123.38349,4,"A female kitchen staff yelled guests because we were looking for the place for throwing garbage.
We don’t know because we are tourists. Do local come here and not know where are the trash cans?
The cashier was very nice and recommended food. A male chef is also nice! I would like to give the two staff 5 starts!
Just fast food taste but restaurants change, so they are expensive. The food in the area seem for tourists.
I give 5 stars for the atmosphere!"
The Fish Store,Seafood Markets,"1 Dallas Road Victoria, BC V8V 0B2 Canada",BC,48.423,-123.38349,5,Our harbour taxi guide recommended this spot as the fried items have a lighter batter than other places on Fisherman’s Wharf. They have happy hour specials on oysters. Chowder with 3 types of salmon was great.
The Fish Store,Seafood Markets,"1 Dallas Road Victoria, BC V8V 0B2 Canada",BC,48.423,-123.38349,5,"Delicious oyster tacos. Halibut taco was a bit dry, but still good. Three way salmon chowder was delicious!  Be prepared to get messy. Was in Victoria for three nights and went twice!  It was worth the return visit."
The Fish Store,Seafood Markets,"1 Dallas Road Victoria, BC V8V 0B2 Canada",BC,48.423,-123.38349,5,"Super tasty B.C. Halibut taco & salmon chowder! The view is great, the server is helpful (it was all her recommendation and it’s all good), too bad we couldn’t try the shrimp yet because it wasn’t ready and we had to leave.

Definitely coming back again, it’s real fresh and good seafood!"
The Cozy Place Restaurant,Chinese,"1692 Douglas Street Victoria, BC V8W 2G6 Canada",BC,48.4292309,-123.364691,5,"Tasty healthy food. They don’t use MSG but the food is flavourful and all the ingredients ate well cooked and fresh. We had the cozy place chow mien, the veggies are sweet and the portion is fulfilling for one person."
The Cozy Place Restaurant,Chinese,"1692 Douglas Street Victoria, BC V8W 2G6 Canada",BC,48.4292309,-123.364691,5,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Victoria 💕 It feels really cozy inside, like the name of the restaurant! All the food I had here was amazing! The price of the foods here is reasonable. I hope everyone in Victoria knows this Cozy Place😊"
The Cozy Place Restaurant,Chinese,"1692 Douglas Street Victoria, BC V8W 2G6 Canada",BC,48.4292309,-123.364691,5,"Surprisingly well managed husband and wife team created a Comfy, cozy place to dine alone or with your love ones.   I ordered the simple but difficult to master scramble eggs with tomato sauce.   The eggs were cooked separately so the flavors and texture of each ingredients were properly celebrated.  My second dish is the slow braised pork spare ribs that was cooked to perfect then it was tossed in with a tang-ee soy based black pepper sauce.  Both dishes were served with generous portion and I had left over to take it to my hotel.  Out of the 5 days on the island, this little place captured my heart with its simple but highly satisfying dishes.   I will come back to try other dishes and to continue my conversation with the owner couple!"

Uchida Eatery / Shokudo,Japanese,"633 Courtney Street Suite 22 Victoria, BC V8W 1B9 Canada",BC,48.42284,-123.36645,5,We love this place. Currently only order for pick up. Such a hidden gem! Fish is so fresh! They use fresh ingredient and locally source organic veggies. We order once a week!
Uchida Eatery / Shokudo,Japanese,"633 Courtney Street Suite 22 Victoria, BC V8W 1B9 Canada",BC,48.42284,-123.36645,5,"This is an authentic shokudo food. You should not compare to a pricey omakase, but you can expect comfort and satisfactory meal. The grilled sockeye collar and the mackerel were wonderful. We are happy to try this place during our visit.

The only complain that I have was the rice, which could be better."
Uchida Eatery / Shokudo,Japanese,"633 Courtney Street Suite 22 Victoria, BC V8W 1B9 Canada",BC,48.42284,-123.36645,5,"This was hands down our favorite and best find in Victoria. We ordered a tuna and salmon lunch, and picked it up the next day to eat at Philips brewery.

Since they are not doing dine in currently, you have to order the lunch the night before online at ~7PM, and then pick it up the next afternoon. We actually got a little lost looking for it, but loved the experience searching for it.

The food itself was fantastic - loved the shredded egg, thought that was pretty unique touch, and the sashimi was fresh, thick and just all around amazing. Would recommend this place to anyone!"
Uchida Eatery / Shokudo,Japanese,"633 Courtney Street Suite 22 Victoria, BC V8W 1B9 Canada",BC,48.42284,-123.36645,5,"If you miss the pre-COViD uchida and have avoided supporting them or leave a low star rating because there is no dine-in option… you are missing out on this gem. I was a long time customer who had his early dates (with my now wife) here.. always loved going there for their dine-in experience.  I am guilty of not going in the last couple years because of not wanting to takeout the amazing food in portable packaging.  I ran into the chef socially in the last couple months and kept saying “I’ll see you soon”.. but today I really pushed myself in using their online ordering system and picking up takeout for a car date with my wife. The number of times I kept saying “wow” as I sat in my car holding the paper box… it’s astounding how much care and love the chef puts into this food. For it to taste this good even in a portable form.. I am embarrassed now to feel that I was waiting for them to resume dine-in to go support this amazing eatery.

Please experience Uchida and let this chef express this talents.  As of this review in Nov 2022, you do you have to order online and pickup at their door.  Trust me, it’s not the same takeout food you are used to. I ate every grain of rice, not to waste a single element of the meal made personally for me."
Uchida Eatery / Shokudo,Japanese,"633 Courtney Street Suite 22 Victoria, BC V8W 1B9 Canada",BC,48.42284,-123.36645,5,Exceptionally delicious and fresh. Order the night before for a stellar take out lunch. Perfect if you’ve got a busy day of meetings or if you’re just visiting and are looking for a healthy picnic to enjoy while touring around our fine city.
Q at The Empress,Seafood,"721 Government St Victoria, BC V8W 1W5 Canada",BC,48.4222401,-123.3680585,5,"A must do while visiting Victoria! High tea in an historic hotel rich in decor and traditions. The food is gorgeous and the service is top notch! Go there hungry, you will be really full once you get through all three tiers of the high tea!"
Q at The Empress,Seafood,"721 Government St Victoria, BC V8W 1W5 Canada",BC,48.4222401,-123.3680585,5,"Stayed at the Empress for 2 nights and looked forward to breakfast at the Q every morning. The food was fresh, prepared well, and tasted, well, like food should taste. It wasn't greasy, overly seasoned or overly salted.

Service was professional but friendly and the atmosphere was wonderful. The restaurant was clean and the Christmas decorations were very tastefully done.

I ordered the tater bowl which was very good. It wasn't oily and felt ""clean"". The fully loaded oatmeal was fruity and had a good mix of flavors from the berries, banana and brown sugar, cream for the oats. My partner had the French toast which she really enjoyed. The granola, we were curious what a 14 dollar granola tasted like, it was just granola with fruits. It was good, but not with the money. There were better options to be had.

Overall, I loved breakfast and look forward to returning again."
Q at The Empress,Seafood,"721 Government St Victoria, BC V8W 1W5 Canada",BC,48.4222401,-123.3680585,5,"The food was excellent, the restaurant beautiful and the staff wonderful. The tenderloin was great, the pavlova to die for. Loved it and want to go back as soon as possible!"

Q at The Empress,Seafood,"721 Government St Victoria, BC V8W 1W5 Canada",BC,48.4222401,-123.3680585,5,"Since we regularly visit the Fairmont Empress, we can say with confidence that it never dissatisfies. Every detail is correct. They have it all dialled!

We adore coming here for some cocktails, beverages, and their cuisine. It's wonderful for lunch, brunch, afternoon tea, cocktails and dinner. Q at the Fairmont Empress is a genuine pleasure. It’s a nice location.

The bartenders are nice, friendly and really knowledgable. At all occasions, the hosts provided excellent service. The drinks and cocktails are outstanding. We have had the Empress Lemonade, Empress, Old Fashioned, Martini Royale. Plus, their popcorn is tasty, unique and produced in-house!

In addition, it is incredible that the Empress Gin, that's their speciality, is made in Victoria! Live music and fantastic vibes can be found at Q at the Fairmont Empress. If you're seeking for an upgraded and elevated experience, I highly recommend this location as you will not be disappointed! Thank you. We shall return. 💯"
BeaverTails,Desserts,"602 Broughton Street Victoria, BC V8W 1C7 Canada",BC,48.4243334,-123.367646,4,"BeaverTails is undoubtedly one of Canada's most iconic and delicious pastries, originating in Ottawa and spreading across the country. However, I can understand why some people may only try it once due to its indulgent nature. The pastry is made of fried dough and topped with a variety of toppings, including cinnamon sugar, chocolate hazelnut, and maple butter, among others. While it's undoubtedly a treat for those with a sweet tooth, the sugar content may be too much for some.

That being said, for those willing to indulge, BeaverTails is a must-try pastry. It's perfect for a special occasion or as a sweet treat on a lazy afternoon."
BeaverTails,Desserts,"602 Broughton Street Victoria, BC V8W 1C7 Canada",BC,48.4243334,-123.367646,5,I was told president Obama visited Beavertail in Ottawa so we wanted to try their food while visiting Victoria.  It was neat and fun.  Good tasty desert.  Don’t expect seatings though as there is only couple of outdoor tables and a few chairs.

I'd have to say the wait for me wasn't that long. The staff were very friendly. I'd have a garbage can on site to put your waste in after eating at the outdoor tables. They serve mostly ice cream and dessert style pastry, but they do have a poutine one and some wrapped hot dogs.
I definitely like this place. If you haven't been there before you should at least try it once."

Fiamo,Italian,"515 Yates Street Victoria, BC V8W 1K7 Canada",BC,48.4266982,-123.3697847,5,"Fiamo is a cozy yet chic Italian restaurant.  Inside the restaurant is romantic, dark, and moody: perfect for a date night, evening cocktails, or having an intimate night to yourself.  They have a closed patio as well as an open-aired one though unfortunately it wasn't open when I visited.

Leah was our server who was methodical in how she went about the steps of service.  Amy also stands out to me in her role as a support staff/host.  Overall, the staff were quality: laid back but also seemed to care for their work.

I came for a Sunday night dinner so regrettably, the pasta dishes weren't available reducing the choices in entree.  However, their rotating specials of the day were a nice addition ensuring greater variety.  This also implies they utilize seasonal ingredients and come up with new dishes in addition to the set menu-- probably more fun for the kitchen staff too!

I ordered their special of the day: Eggplant Parmesan ($26) which was delectable.  I loved the addition of roasted vegetables (including potatoes, broccolini, sweet peppers, and carrots) to brighten up the otherwise heavy dish.

I would recommend this place for those in Victoria and craving a good Italian meal with a charming atmosphere :)."
Fiamo,Italian,"515 Yates Street Victoria, BC V8W 1K7 Canada",BC,48.4266982,-123.3697847,5,"This place offers an exceptional experience that encapsulates the essence of Italy within Victoria. Fiamo consistently delivers satisfying and flavorful dishes, making it a reliable choice for those seeking high-quality cuisine. During my recent visit, I had the pleasure of savoring their delectable chicken parmesan, which flawlessly embodies the essence of Italian gastronomy in every bite. The chicken was impeccably cooked, ensuring it remained moist, while the sauce boasted a delightful and irresistible flavor. My dining companion opted for the classic Italian-American dish of spaghetti and meatballs, which pays homage to the culinary traditions of Southern Italy. According to their assessment, Fiamo did justice to that particular region's cuisine.

However, the absolute standout of the evening was our server. While her name escapes me, her distinctive long blond hair will undoubtedly serve as a recognizable characteristic when you visit this esteemed establishment. She consistently exuded exceptional warmth and friendliness, going above and beyond to engage us in meaningful conversation and cater to our every need with remarkable attentiveness. Her unwavering positive attitude and radiant smile, which stretched from ear to ear, left an indelible impression on us. If you have a craving for authentic Italian cuisine, Fiamo is unequivocally the place to be!"
Fiamo,Italian,"515 Yates Street Victoria, BC V8W 1K7 Canada",BC,48.4266982,-123.3697847,5,We ate dinner outside on a beautiful day. The evening can be chilly but we sat right under the heater. It was perfect! My husband had their beet salad and loved it. We shared some brussel sprouts and they were soooooo good...very crispy on the outside and very flavorful. We shared a pepperoni pizza and the meaty one (can't remember the name) Both were delicious but the meaty one had a nice spice to it. A great dinner to end the day.
Fiamo,Italian,"515 Yates Street Victoria, BC V8W 1K7 Canada",BC,48.4266982,-123.3697847,5,"Fabulous dining experience. Having never been in Victoria, we combed through lots of reviews and dinner suggestions. Fiamo exceeded our best hopes. Everything from the very nice menu, quiet atmosphere, excellent wine list and outstanding specials made deciding on a choice a challenge. Fortunately, we had a top notch server in Leah to guide us every step of the way. Her wine choice was spot on, like all of her recommendations. We are only in town 2 nights, we may just have to go back. You will not be disappointed in this wonderful establishment."
Fiamo,Italian,"515 Yates Street Victoria, BC V8W 1K7 Canada",BC,48.4266982,-123.3697847,2,"Service was great, but the charcuterie board was sad. ☹️It felt like they had transferred sliced meat from a Costco platter to a $28 cheese board. With all of the incredible local meets and cheese around, this platter missed the mark. Brussels sprouts were great though and I’ve been back since this original review - pumpkin ravioli is a hit!"

I've always had amazing food experiences here. I have tried all the pizzas on the menu and quite a few of the monthly features. They have all been amazing. The staff have all been really amazing as well. Great service and great manager. Also, they have a patio behind the restaurant where we were to have our dog with us. Oh ya the ice cream is seriously awesome too."
Virtuous Pie,Pizza,"530 Pandora Avenue Victoria, BC V8W 1N6 Canada",BC,48.4286181,-123.3684944,5,"This is the best vegan pizza I’ve ever had! 🍕 They know what they’re doing and you can taste it! It was my first time here. I loved that they have huge booths in the main area and seats back in their garden patio. I decided to go for the classic Margherita pizza. The pizza was delicious and tasty. To be honest, you don’t really miss the dairy/cheese on the pizza. The pizza’s crust was amazing and not soggy at all. The service was good. Additionally,  I got the vanilla bean ice cream pint to go and it was phenomenal. All in all, I highly recommend Virtuous Pie and I shall return to try other pizzas and items off their menu. 💯"

Luckily Nic was serving us and talked us in to trying the ballpark popcorn. I actually said no first and they suggested I try a sample. Best decision ever. So good. Thanks for the exceptional service and unique ice cream. ❤️ (The raspberry cheesecake was also good but if you have both, eat it before the popcorn one!)"

We had the Mac and cheese skillet, the stranger wings pizza (which was quite spicy) and the pesto cbr. The service was great and we highly recommend"
Breakwater,Cafes,"199 Dallas Road Victoria, BC V8V 1A2 Canada",BC,48.4154371,-123.3846996,3,"The Bistro is in a great area next to the famous Dallas road, close to Ogden point. The service is ok, not bad, not great. The waiters just didn't seem to care much but were still polite. I had a Mac and Cheese and it was so bland that I was shocked 😲 I couldn't taste the cheese at all ???!!! So I can tell it's not real cheese but rather some kind of powdery cheese ( or fake cheese like Velveeta) and there was no salt at all 😑. For $13 and for the tiny quantity, I expected at least a regular Mac and Cheese. And how on earth can you be a Chef and mess up Mac and Cheese? 🤔

Only a cheesecake for desert... not even ice cream or a second option 😕

Overall, it is a place with so much potential, but just not there at all. They probably don't care since it's a tourist trap."

I wish they had more menu items and seating; it's a little pricey but that doesn't stop me from going back. Fish and chips are good and seafood chowder is also delicious. The cocktails are really good too. Highly recommend!"

Pros: food is delicious and healthy,
Service is nice and friendly,
Decor and furniture is modern and relaxing colours,
Outside patio with heater,
Some beautiful and cute merchandise.

Con: there is something wrong with audio insulation of the restaurant that makes it very noisy. So if you need a cosy and quiet place that you can chat easily with friends, it’s better to sit outside."
Bear & Joey Cafe,Cafes,"1025 Cook St Victoria, BC V8V 3Z7 Canada",BC,48.4230104,-123.3539516,5,"Our friends have been urging us to try this place. But we had a ferry to catch and didn't want to be stuck downtown. However, after Google guided us to a less-than-appealing cafe in Christchurch, we decided that we might as well try Bear and Joey. I was dressed in sensible 'ferry-traveling-and-hiking' garb and we didn't have a reservation, the maître d' wasn't thrilled but seated us anyway. One of the original reason I hesitated in coming was the menu. But once we were there, the menu made a lot more sense and we actually had a hard time choosing. My weakness was breakfast sandwich, but at the last minute, I ordered the pork belly sandwich. My partner ordered the fresh toast, of course! We think this place should get a Michelin Star for sure. From ingredients to execution, the food was amazing. I usually only eat salad because it is healthy but actually hating it. But the Bear and Joey kohlrabi and picked cabbage salad was AMAZING, not boring at all. I couldn't stop eating it and finished the salad before attacking the fennel and orange pork belly sandwich. The bread was extra crusty which was quite enjoyable. The pork belly had enough fat to melt in my mouth. Consuming this was a wondering experience. There was a lot of 'mmm' sounds and smiles coming from across the table while my partner enjoyed the french toast. There was a lot more variety of fruit on the french toast that were not mentioned on the menu. If this place was in Vancouver, I imagine it might take us a while to get a reservation. Well done!"
Bear & Joey Cafe,Cafes,"1025 Cook St Victoria, BC V8V 3Z7 Canada",BC,48.4230104,-123.3539516,5,"The location is great. Patio is open, and has heaters. Service was great. Food was absolutely amazing ! Thanks to the server for the French toast recommendation. If you think you have had better French toast, you would be wrong. All their dishes are transformed. The flat whites are also better than the Bucks
Thank you for a wonderful experience 👍"

Bear & Joey Cafe,Cafes,"1025 Cook St Victoria, BC V8V 3Z7 Canada",BC,48.4230104,-123.3539516,4,"I have eaten here multiple times with different groups of people (dine in and take out) and I’ve never had a bad experience. I’ve tried the bread pudding and it was really different since it was savory, but it was hands down the best item I’ve had there. I’ve also tried the French toast (photo below), the breakfast sandwich, and the salmon Benny which were all delicious. Their coffee is great and they have decaf options. The only reason I would not give this five stars is because it can be a little pricy."

I called last minute asking for a reservation, and they managed to fit us right in. Ordered the Crab Cakes and Halibut, and the lady got chicken. Everything was delicious, and we couldn't have asked for a perfect final date night on the island. I'm definitely coming back next holiday. Thank you!"
Blue Crab Seafood House,Seafood,"146 Kingston Street Victoria, BC V8V 1V4 Canada",BC,48.422146,-123.3795799,4,"We were staying near by while on vacation in Victoria and really wanted to have a seafood dinner, after reviewing a bunch of different places we decided on blue crab, the menu looked quite good and the restaurant offered really nice views of the local harbor. We started with an order of the chowder,  fresh oysters and a local Hazy IPA on tap. The chowder was quite nice and had a good broth with rich flavors,  my partner enjoyed the oysters but wasn't a huge fan of the in house hot sauce. As for mains I ordered the local Dungeness crab and my partner ordered the steamer pot. The crab was fairly good the legs were a decent size,  the head piece is just for show as they remove all material from the head, I enjoyed the crab but still wonder if I should have ordered the Alaskan crab legs. As for the steamer pot we found it to be sadly a bit on the average side the sauce was alright and the assortment of seafood didn't seem as fresh as other places we tried while in the area. The restaurant isn't too bad and the views are quite nice.  If your staying in the area for a few days give this place a try for dinner"
Blue Crab Seafood House,Seafood,"146 Kingston Street Victoria, BC V8V 1V4 Canada",BC,48.422146,-123.3795799,4,"The atmosphere was nice, staff were great. A tad on the expensive side if you were to compare other restaurants with the same quality of food and service."

An excellent dining experience supplemented  with knowledge, courtesy and attention to detail.  Thank you Blue Crab for a memorable dining experience!"

Never disappointed and we were happy to bring two couples with us this time. The ""first-timers"" were as impressed with their selections as well.  There is an accessible washroom (single room) which I believe is part of the hotel.  Unfortunately, there are a few things that need to be improved to make it friendlier.  The hook mounted on the door is too high for someone in a wheelchair as is the towel dispenser which requires hand motion to activate it.  These things could be easily fixed by adding a lower coat hook and lowering the towel dispenser.  The room is a good size and the there is an assist bar mounted beside the toilet."

Try it and buy it!
You can find it also in stores in Victoria.

Sookjai Thai Restaurant,Thai,"893 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8W 1H7 Canada",BC,48.4239609,-123.360217,5,"Being in a relationship with a Thai partner presents a delightful challenge when it comes to finding Thai restaurants that evoke a sense of nostalgia and familiarity. Interestingly, this particular establishment effortlessly meets all of his stringent criteria. As he savored each bite, he couldn't help but wonder about the chef's background. To his astonishment, the chef hailed from China but had dedicated time to master his craft in the northern regions of Thailand, precisely where my partner originates. Such unexpected alignment only heightened his appreciation for the culinary offerings.

With utmost confidence, I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to those seeking an authentic Thai dining experience. The food itself is a testament to its genuineness, while the ambiance exudes a quintessential Thai atmosphere with whimsical touches that add a touch of enchantment. Furthermore, the staff's warmth and affability further enhance the overall dining experience. Rest assured, selecting this establishment will undoubtedly result in a memorable and gratifying culinary journey."

Amazing quality of food and a really exotic palette of flavors… Thai food this good is hard to come by. Truly artesanal in craftsmanship both visually and in taste. Also, plentiful serving sizes!

The servers were nothing but friendly and had wonderful suggestions. The only complaint I had was that with menu offerings at these prices, it seems a bit gimmicky to charge extra for things like plain rice… while I understand charging for it, I think it should come with the larger curry dishes, especially considering the already steep pricing.

Nonetheless, a really memorable restaurant experience and this place is often packed to the tee - expect a long wait and come hungry!"

Everything was freshly made (and you can taste the difference), the staff were wonderful, and the prices were fair. They have quite a variety of gluten free items which can be hard to find for sushi. They were also very knowledgeable and let me know what was and wasn't safe for celiacs. Definitely will be going back!"
Tacofino,Mexican,"760 Pandora Avenue Victoria, BC V8W 1N9 Canada",BC,48.4280293,-123.3628808,5,"I have been here so many times now and also ordered take-out many times as well. Absolutely love tacofinos tacos. My favorite is by far the yam taco and burrito. I love how crunchy the yam taco is all that cabbage and a very simple tasty dressing. Everything that I've eaten here has been amazing. This place is almost always busy, so come early or order ahead. Staff is always very friendly and helpful, and I also love the side pick-up window. Which is separate from the front till order area, so you dont have to wait in line with everyone who is ordering their meals. The one downside is where the till/order area is, it is a huge bottleneck and can be very crowded at times."
Tacofino,Mexican,"760 Pandora Avenue Victoria, BC V8W 1N9 Canada",BC,48.4280293,-123.3628808,5,"Incredible Tacos!
Found myself pulled here by my sister while visiting her this weekend. Popped in line (there often is a short line I hear), and had our order taken, then delivered shortly thereafter. A number tag and bottle of water with a cute blue cap is handed to me before we head to our table. The server recommended the crispy chicken taco. My sister swore to me that the steak taco was the best I’d ever have. The former was great, but the latter was indeed true. Get a steak taco.
Bonus points for local Phillips Brewery on tap. Modern aesthetic and low key vibe brought it all together.
Highly recommend checking this place out."

Nice vibes in a convenient spot downtown for some killer Mexican food. The offerings might not be “authentic” but they’re reaaaaally good - get over it. Loved everything I had here, and even the margarita delivered! Hot sauces have my mouth-watering at the memory of them…

Definitely a spot I’ll be coming back to!"
Tacofino,Mexican,"760 Pandora Avenue Victoria, BC V8W 1N9 Canada",BC,48.4280293,-123.3628808,1,"Eating at Tacofino on Canada day was a awesome experience!
It was my first visit & the employees created a terrific vibe. It was so keen to watch the employee prepare the burrito 🌯!  It was a very satisfying meal. Burrito was a bit messy to eat hence why napkins are in abundance.

I definitely will return to this restaurant."

The food is absolutely delicious, with a menu that offers plenty of options to choose from.

Cactus Club Cafe,Canadian (New),"1085 Canada Place Vancouver, BC V6C 3E1 Canada",BC,49.2894022,-123.1180433,3,"I recently dined at Cactus Club Restaurant and wanted to share my thoughts. Although there was a delay in receiving our food, the staff was incredibly friendly and made us feel welcome throughout our visit. The restaurant itself had a great ambiance and provided a pleasant environment for our meal.
One area of improvement would be the selection of non-alcoholic drinks, which was somewhat limited. It would be nice to see a wider variety of options in that regard. On the other hand, I must commend the kitchen on the fantastic calamari. It was cooked to perfection and had a delicious flavor that left me wanting more.
However, I found the ravioli with shrimp to be a bit too sweet for my taste. While it may appeal to those who enjoy sweeter flavors, I personally would have preferred a more balanced taste.
Overall, my experience at Cactus Club Restaurant was positive, with the standout being the delightful calamari. Despite the minor setbacks, I would still recommend visiting for a friendly atmosphere and memorable dining experience."

The staff was very kind and the food was great, though my chicken sandwich was better than the tofu bowl (which lacked sauce and was a bit dry). Really good fries! The cocktail menu was large and the cocktails themselves were very tasty, too.

While the views were lovely, the restaurant was VERY loud and it could be difficult to hear the person sitting across from you!"

I had salmon for dinner and it was delicious. I sat in the dining room with a water view. Most people wore sunglasses because the sun was bright and bold at 8pm at night! My waiter was awesome. I wish I remembered his name. It’s a crowed place, so make reservations early. They have outside eating and since it’s right on the water side, it’s a great place to take a stroll afterwards."

First issue, kids were not prioritized even though we mentioned that they were hungry and adult can wait. Server only took drinks order then prioritized smaller table to get their meal order as it will take short time to do so compared to our table regardless they were seated after us. Last thing was they added gratuity to our bill without prior information which left us no choice but to pay. That's was the main reason we wanted separate table and being charge for service that we considered not there.
Other than those issues that left us disappointed, food taste was incredible, freshly prepared ingredients with jam, sauce,everything taste amazing. Worth to visit for food only."

We tried their delicious breakfast menu. Generous portion and we were so full that we needed to walk it out. The staff was humble and all their recommendations were spot on. Must try !!

We ordered the berry waffles and the poutine benny and my oh my were they delicious. The contrast between the sweet and savory meals was delightful (my wife and I shared our meals). The waffles were honestly the best waffles I have ever eaten. Each bite nearly brought a tear to my eye from being so tasty. The only complaint is that I live about 1000 miles away from The Ruby 😞. This restaurant alone tempts me to uproot my family and move to Victoria just to eat breakfast here every week.

A side note, we were with our 17 month old baby and the staff was sooo kind and accommodating with him."

I think I have found a new breakfast favourite when in Victoria! A must try is the lavender latte! So many delicious dishes to choose from.

You must be patient if you want to come here, can take 30-40 min wait. But it has a nice sitting area. Good food though, was worth the wait."

Didn't have to wait too long for a table. Service was top notch, friendly, and prompt. I'm a Waffle 🧇/ Pancake 🥞 girl and The Ruby did not disappoint me. Caramelized bananas 🍌, roasted pecans and bourbon syrup, on top of a stack of mouth watering waffles 🧇. Hubby had an omelet with bacon 🥓, mushrooms 🍄, and cheese 🧀.
Thank you Ruby!!!! ✌️"
The Ruby,Breakfast & Brunch,"3110 Douglas Street Victoria, BC V8Z 3K4 Canada",BC,48.4460473,-123.3717578,5,"Went here for brunch. The food was amazing & the portions were huge! The potatoes are the perfect crispy fluffy ratio. The duck just fell off the bone & the sauce that same with it paired perfectly well. Would definitely go back & recommended. Only downside is that it's small so not lots of seating, but still worth a visit. The staff were also helpful & friendly :)"
Dumpling Drop,Dumplings,"556a Pandora Ave Pandora St. Victoria, BC V8W 1N7 Canada",BC,48.4287317,-123.3675159,5,A quaint place with a few tables for unique Thai cuisines like pork belly and lemongrass chicken dumplings. Little buns stuffed with crispy chicken is a must-try. The delicious spicy sauce adds just the right heat.
Dumpling Drop,Dumplings,"556a Pandora Ave Pandora St. Victoria, BC V8W 1N7 Canada",BC,48.4287317,-123.3675159,3,"Very polite staff, quick service. Ordered one order of pork belly dumplings & one special dumplings which was lemongrass chicken. The hot sauce they use is so overpowering I can't really taste the different between the actual flavor of the fillings in the two types of dumplings. Didn't know they were going to be served deep fried; has a very westernized spin on the dish. This is my fault for not doing research prior to walking in the establishment.

It's fine for a quick in and out appetizer, not filling for a meal at all."
Dumpling Drop,Dumplings,"556a Pandora Ave Pandora St. Victoria, BC V8W 1N7 Canada",BC,48.4287317,-123.3675159,5,"Decided to stop in here to grab a quick bite while exploring around Victoria. I'm glad we did, they had a great special that was dumplings and a beer and it was a warm day. We got the order of pork belly dumplings and the beer. I haven't really had dumplings like this before but my wife had, so I was pretty excited. This place didn't disappoint. The chili oil that was on these and gave them a pleasant kick. They were nice and full and cooked so nicely. They held their shape and they didn't get soggy. The filling was delicious and juicy. It was a great little shop with friendly people and a great special. I wish we could have bought some of the dumplings to take back with us, but we didn't have a cooler."
Dumpling Drop,Dumplings,"556a Pandora Ave Pandora St. Victoria, BC V8W 1N7 Canada",BC,48.4287317,-123.3675159,5,"Ordered the chicken bao & chicken dumplings and they were delicious! The sauce served with both were just as good.

Only issue is the wait time for take out however the wait was worth it."
Dumpling Drop,Dumplings,"556a Pandora Ave Pandora St. Victoria, BC V8W 1N7 Canada",BC,48.4287317,-123.3675159,5,"It was our first time at Dumpling Drop and will certainly not be the last! The dumplings and the chilli sauce were amazing. We came here for lunch we ordered the vegan dumplings and the Yuzu Brussels sprouts. Honestly, we weren’t expecting the dumplings to be fried but we really enjoyed them.

The dumplings were crunchy and packed with great flavours. This place is excellent for a quick stop and bite. In my opinion, it’s more of a take-out spot as there are limited seating inside but nonetheless, I appreciated the charm of this place. It’s cute and comfortable. They also had some cute Dumpling Drop Merch that you can buy. The hostess at the cashier was friendly and brought our foods quite fast once we ordered. Additionally, they have a large selection of frozen dumplings to buy and take home.

All in all, I’d come back again! I would totally recommend eating here and go for some appetizing dumplings 🥟"

Started with a condensed milk shaft that I absolutely loved and every dish that followed was great. I ordered the pork and the texture was perfect, very soft and dissolved in your mouth. The broccoli and the cheesecake were also super tasty. I ordered three dishes to share, one cheesecake, and one cookie and it was more than enough for two people so I recommend sharing. Service was great, we sat at the bar and they were very attentive and helpful when explaining portion size etc. I would definitely recommend this place!"

Part and Parcel,Canadian (New),"2656 Quadra Street Victoria, BC V8T 4E4 Canada",BC,48.4390886,-123.3593378,5,Completely delicious with layered flavors. Wife said the cheese cake was true best she ever had. Treat your self.

It’s easy to pass it on the street so keep looking if you miss it first time. The food is some of the best I’ve ever tasted. I got there in time for happy hour and tasted two amazing appetizers for $8 total. One was made from only chickpea flour and deep fried to perfection served with a delicious spicy sauce. The second delicious piece was grilled pork belly. The flavour was fabulous. I ordered the Kalettes veggie main course and again the flavours didn’t disappoint. Rich and unusual while being amazing. My server strongly recommended the chocolate dessert which I cannot say enough about. It was sweet, salty, creamy and decadent without being overpowering. Overall the meal was 5 star. The vibe of the place is calm and smooth while being friendly and relaxed. I will definitely be back."
Part and Parcel,Canadian (New),"2656 Quadra Street Victoria, BC V8T 4E4 Canada",BC,48.4390886,-123.3593378,4,"Delicious food with an intimate atmosphere. The Kamut chicken slider and the wasabi fries were unexpected highlights. There definitely were more blistered peppers in two orders than four people could tackle, so I’d start with one order next time. The pork belly bite had amazing flavours but was more of a jerky than other pork belly dishes I’ve had before. The Parisian gnocchi main was delicious but extremely heavy - we thought it might have been deep fried. Fun little place for a girls night out."
Cafe Brio,Italian,"944 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8V 3K2 Canada",BC,48.42405,-123.3576042,5,"Absolutely incredible meal - from service, to atmosphere, to quality of the fare. We had the lamb, fish of the day, steak, and cured meats (which are made in house), and cheeses. Everything was fresh, well balanced, and very flavourful. One of our new favourite staples in Victoria"
Cafe Brio,Italian,"944 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8V 3K2 Canada",BC,48.42405,-123.3576042,5,"No surprise that the food and service was amazing. A medium sized menu with a nice variety of choices. Most have the option to get half portions so you try a few different dishes easily enough. I assumed the full portion would be smaller due to being a fancy joint but it was very filling.

I had the pork cutlet which was mouth watering. I tried the beat salad and carbonara pasta as well - both amazing.

The only thing to complain about, and you can probably tell from the photos, is the lighting! If it's so dark your wait staff carry flashlights to read the menu... It's probably too dark.

Would be happy to return!"
Cafe Brio,Italian,"944 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8V 3K2 Canada",BC,48.42405,-123.3576042,5,"My husband and I enjoyed several beautiful meals at Cafe Brio when we lived in Victoria 15 years ago. While visiting the island this past weekend we decided to go back. This place remains just as exceptional as we remember. The food and wine is outstanding, the atmosphere is perfectly moody and interesting, but it's the service that really sets it apart. It truly feels like every staff member is committed to making your experience great. Our favourite restaurant in Victoria. We will be back again and again."
Cafe Brio,Italian,"944 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8V 3K2 Canada",BC,48.42405,-123.3576042,4,"Reservations recommended. Went with the brio family style shared dinner @ $67 per person, chef’s choice, 6 dishes overall. Since it’s random, I’ll speak to what we were served: clam chowder cup (meh, soup on the lighter side, New England style). Romaine lettuce salad (ok, garnished with crumbs, garlic, sharp cheese) charcuterie board with pate (good), bresaola (good) rabbit terrine (delicious) sausage (good). Mains: gnocchi (good) duck with beets (yum) fish with pancetta(?) and fingerling potatoes (yum). Party of 4 + bottle of wine = $380 not including tips. Overall, I’d stick with ordering charcuterie + individual mains, though the variety was nice. Service…our waitress was good though didn’t bring the requested balsamic vinegar and olive oil."
Cafe Brio,Italian,"944 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8V 3K2 Canada",BC,48.42405,-123.3576042,5,This place was great. The atmosphere perfect. The bartender was friendly and made my friend a custom drink. The boards are delicious…the duck with the Brie and quince jelly was a 10/10 combo. My only regret was not getting the bartender’s name to put in the review because he was both authentic and kind.

Fantastic tasty fresh food, of good proportions, cooked by a 30 year experienced Beijing chef.  Service was fabulous, with a very humble, kind, gracious, friendly and gentle server.  Didn’t have to wait at all for food to be prepared hot and fresh, even though they were busy with a constant stream of online delivery orders, and dine-in patrons. Humble environment, which only makes the experience more of an amazing meal. $$$"

Beijing Bistro,Chinese,"769 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8W 1G9 Canada",BC,48.424312,-123.3634765,2,"Good service. But the food was done incorrectly. Some dish done with wrong sauce, or cut vegetable in a wrong way that completely not washed, or meat under cooked.

According to the  menu, some dishes are pro-level and not regular home chief can handle. But the food we got today is not up to average chinese parent level.

The food quality is hard to justify these high score reviews, maybe something went wrong with their chief or management."

We always take kids for the kid’s meal and treat ourselves to beer and burger. Even with their regular price is still worth it! I love the Tuna burger “off the hook” it’s so yummy. My husband loves their Big Dipper burger with Wagyu beef.
The after 9 deal you have to be there and put your name in the waitlist….wait to get in….wait for burgers…end up you gotta be there for at least more than an hour…. It’s good when you go hang out I’m with friend. Not suggest yo ho with kids for late night deal!"

I wanted to come back for happy hour and enjoy the outdoor terrace with my dog ​​(service dog). The waitress didn't want my dog ​​to go on the Patio! It's the only patio in town where your dog (service dog or not) is not welcome, I won't set foot here again, as much for the welcome, the service as the food! I do not recommend this establishment at all."

Absolutely awesome. So many flavours and couldn’t be more impressed. The fact that you can get a gourmet side salad with this burger is impressive. The burger itself was great. Fresh vegetables and tasty meat.
Moist and delicious. We also tried the red onion rings. Very good also.  Impressive amount of options. My wife had the Ahi tuna burger which she loved. I would highly recommend you try this restaurant."

- you may need an extra napkin, burgers kinda a messy.
- use knife and fork to finish of the last morsel, burger falls apart towards the end.

Staff was friendly, professional, and responsive. Still, were not obtrusive; I appreciated that.

COVID protocols in place and not arduous; respectfully requested my contact details.

My fourth visit to this location; my best burger choice to date."

We came for a comedy night and while we had to buy tickets they were very reasonably priced.  The food was pretty good, drinks were good too.

The guest skills of the staff were exceptional and made me feel welcome and appreciated from the moment I walked in. 👍👏

As for the food, I highly recommend the tofu dish - it was simply delicious! 🌱🍲 The dish was perfectly cooked and had a nice blend of flavors that left me wanting more. The chef truly knows how to work their magic in the kitchen. 🤤

The ambiance of the restaurant is also worth mentioning - it was cozy, warm, and inviting, making it the perfect spot for a night out with friends or a romantic dinner. 🕯️❤️

Overall, I highly recommend The Mint to anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience in downtown Victoria. With friendly and attentive guest skills and mouth-watering dishes like the tofu, it's a must-visit destination for foodies and those seeking a memorable night out. 🍽️👌"

Enter The Mint. A full curry menu through late night!! Incredible. Ordered the lamb curry plate and it was delicious."

It is extremely busy so I highly recommend you make reservations ahead of time. You likely won’t be able to get in without reservation because you have to go thru security like the airport and they won’t even open the locked door if you don’t have reservation.

The menu items are plentiful with a wide range of choices to satisfy all different dietary needs. The price is also cheap compare to other restaurants. The staff there were all very nice and accommodating. The building itself has over a hundred years of history. Inside the restaurant they have some rather interesting old photos hanging on the wall. Make sure you ask the staff there about some of the more unique photos."

Will definitely return next time I'm in town."

It's a dark, cool spot downstairs and is totally like a cenote. It was recommended by a bartender in the city for good cocktails and a relaxed vibe and they were right. We had such a great time and the bartenders made great drinks for us. Some classics and a few custom cocktails. Inexpensive as well which is always a bonus. We didn't eat so we can't comment on the food but the menu looked super fun."

I love pork momos  - so delicious!

Their meat is supplied by local island farms. All curries are cooked with cream of cashew, are gluten free an dairy free.

Nice calming atmosphere. Dalai Lama’ quotes on the walls are a very nice touch.

Tibetan Kitchen,Himalayan/Nepalese,"680 Broughton Street Victoria, BC V8W 1C9 Canada",BC,48.4242226,-123.3660772,4,"Tried calling to the restaurant to make an advance order before stopping by at noon; got answering machine stating closed dates for Dec 2021 🤯 which is weird for a first time customer in late Oct 2022? Didn't leave a message figuring it probably won't make too much of a difference. Not going to bother with delivery services as nowadays it costs way more to use them when my temp job is one block away.

Came in, server is quite prompt taking my order as soon as she took orders from customers before me which is fair. Food came in reasonable time considering it looks like one server & one cook in the establishment. I could have done takeout but like the unique ambiance of the place & wanted to try a dine in lunch experience.

Lunch lamb curry was amazing, packed a delicious punch in flavor. Medium spice heat I ordered is quite up there & was close to my level limit; wondered how spicy hot is?

(I'm laughing mentally because my ex-boyfriend with absolute zero heat tolerance would not thrive unless the restaurant offers a zero heat option?) On a serious note, if anyone has a severe lack of spicy heat tolerance, please triple check with the server upon ordering.

Server was free enough to walk around with a water pitcher but never stopped by to check upon me for first taste or anything else. 😭 Did tell her when I walked to the till to get my bill to pay about compliments to the chef & my gratitude for the tasty & filling meal that was obviously made with humble TLC.

The meal is a real winner, good value, & the spice did well to clear my nasal congestion & nagging post-common cold cough. Definitely will become my go to lunch spot whenever I neglect to pack a filling meal to work & will recommend for dinners too."

As for my choice, the Tiger Prawn Shaptak, it was a divine revelation. Each succulent prawn was generously coated in a tantalizing blend of spices that delighted my taste buds with every single bite. The dish was an impeccable balance of bold and harmonious flavors.

And I enjoyed my visit!

Highlights:
Reasonable prices
Nice patio view
Dog friendly patio
Pretty tasty food
Roomy, Accessible washrooms

Consider:
Could get busy because of the nice location if pursuing patio seating
Fewer washrooms

Friends and I went on a Sunday, at noon- it opens at noon, and we had no problem grabbing a table for four. The menu is a good size- definitely give it a look. Two of my friends got the nachos- with added protein. They usually like their nachos over-done, and my friends were pleased with their food. I had a bite of nachos with the added chicken- I highly recommend that, for sharing or solo! The chicken was quite reasonably sprinkled over the nachos with some love, not just lightly. It was tasty, not too salty for me.

Now please excuse my photos- the blue umbrella really adds a colour filter, and everything looks so blue! I had potato salad as a side to my chicken wings- it was a normal potato salad. Absolutely enjoyed the Louie Blue flavour of the wings though, which had a very slight heat- my friend that is sensitive to spicy flavors could tolerate it well. It was very flavourful. My only complaint (all comes down to preference?) Is that the generous and lovely sauce removed the crispness of the chicken wings. But the sauce made it up for the lack of crisp. Server was wonderful, able to check in on us as the customers started arriving more and more.

I would come again, to sample the pizza- it looked appetizing!"

Sult Pierogi Bar,Polish,"609 Yates St Victoria, BC V8W 1L1 Canada",BC,48.4264262,-123.3669085,4,Very much enjoyed a recent visit and service. Odd that they ran out of white wine (early) that night.  Somewhat disappointed by inconsistent sear on pierogies and extremely tough exterior to otherwise tasty meatballs (maybe intentional?). Sauerkraut bland (I've actually made better at home). Apparently we missed news of the sour cream shortage; we were allotted a few thimbles full.  Confusing menu; many ways to order the same thing but at different prices.  Pierogi flavors very successful. Caesar cocktail very good.

Sult Pierogi Bar,Polish,"609 Yates St Victoria, BC V8W 1L1 Canada",BC,48.4264262,-123.3669085,5,"Ordered the Pierogi Sampler, Dude Where's My Diner?, Pierogi Poutine, Borscht, and the Hulk Smash Pierogis. Every single bite of all the dishes was fantastic.

The pierogi sampler was delicious, a little bit of everything for the indecisive or curious, like myself. The hulk smash pierogis were so tasty I had to order more! A little spice with every bite

Dude where's my diner? was everything French toast, buffalo chicken, pierogis could be. The bacon confit was a beautiful touch, the cream cheese complimented everything nicely, and the jalapeño-bacon chutney tied it all together. I cannot say enough good things about this dish

The borscht was to die for. It was rich and smooth, the cabbage and beets played beautifully together and every bite was a treat.

Finally, the poutine was also very good

I highly recommend a stop here for whatever tickles your fancy!! My only complaint was sold out hats! I was very much looking forward to being a tourist and promoting my favorite pierogi bar! Oh well, this works too!!"

The Fritos was really really good (highly recommend); especially the fried Jicama was a unique touch. The Moroccan chicken was good (nothing special though, slightly bland chicken). This chicken dish had couscous base was well done and seasoned. The gambas con coco  came
with focaccia, it was a 7/10 (good), the sauce was delicious."

Had margarita pziza and chicken cubanette.  Both very tasty.  Drinks as well.  Fun spot to enjoy a drink and some food!"

There were even diners sitting in the patio.  Music was loud but not too much that you can’t have a conversation, the lighting was pleasantly dim to set the ambiance, fire will from time to time light up the corner in the open kitchen, and there was a candle in each table.
Our host and server were very friendly and made you feel at ease, all around good vibes with the staff.
We ordered the papás with both sauces, the mixed olives with focaccia, the fried fish bites and the roasted eggplant in marinara.
Also had a nice Spanish beer to wash it down.  Everything was on point and delicious.  The four tapas were enough for the 2 of us to share this evening.
Would go there again to try the other dishes and the desserts!"

I'd heard good things and my expectations were exceeded. From the friendly attentive service, fresh coffee and timely refills, helpful menu recommendations. Everything sounded so good.

The flavours and textures and presentation are spot on.
It was all just so good and we left happy and very full.

It was a tasty dish with a hint of spice that gave it an extra kick. I also loved the homemade salsa sauce - it was so good that I ended up buying a bottle to take home with me.

The service was also very friendly and fast. The atmosphere of the restaurant was cozy and welcoming, and it was right next to the sea which.

For dessert, I decided to try the churros pancakes which were simply delicious. However, I must say that they were a bit too sweet for my taste.

Additionally, there were plenty of parking spots available right in front of the restaurant which made it very convenient. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a tasty breakfast with a great view and friendly service."

Irish Times Pub,Irish Pub,"1200 Government Street Victoria, BC V8W 1Y3 Canada",BC,48.4258565,-123.3679504,3,"Ordered the Cod Fish & Chips, Crab Bisque, and Shepherd's Pie, only one was worth writing home about. The fish & chips was a large portion, but, the batter was very greasy and the fries were soggy. The fish itself was decent, but the subpar batter was disappointing to say the least. The shepherd's pie was a little overpriced, all things considered. While it was okay, it wasn't very memorable; it felt thrown together and rushed. However, the crab bisque and included bread were absolutely incredible. The bisque itself was rich and creamy, little pieces of crab floating around, it had a nice kick to it and overall was very good.

The service was very good considering how busy they were, and the atmosphere was also very inviting and comfortable. However, all together, I wouldn't necessarily recommend coming here. It was okay for a one time experience, but wouldn't return."
Irish Times Pub,Irish Pub,"1200 Government Street Victoria, BC V8W 1Y3 Canada",BC,48.4258565,-123.3679504,4,"I had the Shepherd’s Pie here for about 22 CAD. It tasted pretty good, I just wish the portion size was a little larger.

Men’s bathroom could be cleaned better, water and toilet paper was strewn all over the floor. I don’t know if this is a normal pub thing or not considering I can’t drink in most countries yet. Other than that I quite liked the interior of the restaurant.

Service was great, a waiter came to check on us during the meal and we didn’t have to wait long to get the bill.  All in all, I might come back when I visit Victoria again."

Though we did not eat during this visit, very inviting looking food serving trays passed us by often, held aloft as they were hefted up from the cellar kitchen. Lost count of all the smartly uniformed staff working here - bartender (female) was very sharp and attentive but left us alone doing our thing. Huge selection of spirits and drafts.  Will be back!"

While there was a minor issue with finding a hair in my sister’s drink, they promptly replaced it, demonstrating thoughtfulness. However, they didn’t remove it from the bill as a gesture.

If you’re visiting Victoria, it’s worth a try, but be cautious about the hair incident.😉"

I was very pleasantly surprised by the whole experience! Nice clean atmosphere, great wait staff, and surprisingly delicious food.

No. But the consistency of food and service would certainly bring me back again!"

I was a fairly warm day, so it was nice to find a beautiful patio to have some drinks and eats. I would strongly suggest sitting in the oudoor patio area.

Food - had potential and looked very pleasing at first but was over cooked and lacked taste.  Potatoes and fries felt it was warmed up.

And finally service - well, our server when they finally came was fine.  I have to admit I felt I was inconveniencing them by asking for a menu after sitting down for 10 min was.

Probably a great place to go for drinks!"

The noise level inside the establishment was so high that having a conversation became quite challenging. It created an uncomfortable and chaotic dining experience.

Furthermore, the food did not meet my expectations. Specifically, the chicken in the chicken burger lacked flavor and tasted predominantly like bread. The absence of a distinct chicken taste was disappointing. To enhance the flavor, we had to request hot sauce to dip the chicken in.

While this restaurant has room for improvement, it's important to consider that individual experiences can vary."
Heron Rock Bistro,Breakfast & Brunch,"435 Simcoe Street Victoria, BC V8V 4T4 Canada",BC,48.4156474,-123.3753358,5,"I absolutely love Heron Rock! Best Chicken and Waffles Eggs Benny in town. Tucked away in James Bay with a warm friendly atmosphere and the loveliest staff, definitely worth a visit! I would highly suggest brunch, they serve all week until 3pm. Chefs Choice Triple Benny is a great way to explore the menu or for people who can't decide and like a surprise. The chef will make you three different Benny's of their choosing and it's been super yummy every time! If you're feeling like a Cesar or Mimosa, Heron Rock has a fantastic list of all kinds of Cesar's to try as well as their ""Manmosa""."

We visited on a Friday early noon, which isn't as busy as the evenings and weekends. The staff were very welcoming and informative on what's in their dishes and the ingredients. The restaurant manager was also very open and actively interacting with customers when we were served and eating. The overall environment of the place is clean, with neat little decorations and an organized self-serve section for cutlery and drinks. The prices are a bit on the higher end, but for the place and service it's worth it.

The mac when to him is a killer! 😅 it's perfectly rich, exquisite flavors with lots of vegetables and nuts, perfectly seasoned too!

The waitress was very friendly and kind. The food were amazingly plated. The smoothies were a treat. However I didn’t appreciate the spring burger and the sandwich we ordered. The bread and the veggie patty and tempeh were too dry for our liking. The buns were too crumbly, dry and dense. My excitement for coming back  here went down. Im pretty sure their other menu selections are tasty."

The food was outstanding, especially the gluten free bread on the sandwich and the Mezze in particular. I thought the tacos lacked a little punch and would have liked a touch more flair or flavour in them, but that in no way detracts from a well deserved five star vegan lunch. The roast potatoes were so perfect too. Yum! Excited to take my family when they visit."

They have such cool cocktails with cool names, ours were delicious!

There were still two vegan mains we didn’t get to try yet!! Such a lovely experience! 😍🩷"

The service was impeccable, the food was beyond what my taste buds could handle, and the decor was astonishing!
I felt welcomed and the service was fast, sweet, and they were able to handle our dietary concerns (no seafood).

The drinks are very well made and the flavours were absolutely scrumptious.

I highly recommend this place for your next birthday dinner, or fancy date night!"

Our waitress was very helpful, the food was great and the atmosphere was welcoming. I got the stuffed poblano peppers.  It was very flavorful and filling with a bit of a spicy kick. Also, got a goddess cocktail. I also recommend the oysters and the deconstructed apple pie. ❤️"

We were short of time and wanted to eat something before taking the bus to the ferries… they brought all our food on a timely manner as well as the drinks!
Service was wonderful
The next time I come to Victoria, will definitely eat at this place!!"

Kind of easy to miss spot on Fort St, but if you are craving Chinese food this is a good spot.  Food was incredibly quick to come out, and was served hot.  Spicy Beef Satay was my favorite, also tried the Cashew Chicken which was a bit mushroom heavy for my taste.  I didn't think the dishes listed as spicy were very spicy at all.  I will return, great value!"

Also, the food is served very quickly. My favorite dishes at this restaurant are the House Special Fried Rice and House Special Chow Mein. You should try them when you visit this restaurant.
By the way, it is recommended to make a reservation for dinner on Fridays and Saturdays as it gets very crowded."
J & J Wonton Noodle House,Chinese,"1012 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8V 3K4 Canada",BC,48.4238736,-123.3561296,1,"It was my first time here and I was not impressed with the food. The service was fine, they were nice but the food was lacking. My friend and I ordered the pork chow mein and the tofu eggplant vegetable dish. The noodles for the pork chow mein was not what we were expecting, it was crunchy and stale. I was expecting normal chow mein noodles but that was not the case. The dish was overly sauced too, there wasn't any other flavour other than the sauce itself. The pork was cut very small and thin. It was the same thing for the tofu eggplant dish. It was drenched in sauce, there was nothing special about it. The sauce was super salty too. The vegetables in both dishes were fine but it wasn't good for what it was worth."
J & J Wonton Noodle House,Chinese,"1012 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8V 3K4 Canada",BC,48.4238736,-123.3561296,5,"I don’t give a five star very often, but this place blew me away. First off for anyone else that’s Gluten Free or Celiac, the absolute peace of mind that you can order something made in a GF kitchen and not be stressed out about problems is phenomenal.

Secondly their GF menu is a second standalone which was nicely flushed out with a mixture of dishes. i’ve read other reviewers talking about the cost and yes it is a bit over average but I guess the dishes I ordered were just on the mark. all three were very large servings and good ingredients. Plus you know when you are used to gluten-free lifestyle you unfortunately get used to very high prices -so this seemed reasonable for me.

Go to be honest it was my first sit down since the pandemic so I was pretty excited, but the whole experience was great. Didn’t wait long for a table, had excellent and attentive service, very open to answer questions and make suggestions. No awkward having to explain being gluten-free or asking about ingredients in substitutions. It was just easy. I had a nice seat facing the street in the window for some people watching.

The food did not take long and filled my entire table! I guess because it’s been a long time since I’ve eaten out , but I was shocked at how much food there was on my plate. My three dishes lasted me 3 1/2 meals. And If you haven’t read my reviews before, I eat big!

OK let’s talk about the food.
I did shoot a great video of it but unfortunately you can’t upload it so check out my pictures.

I had a combination of standard chinese dishes and one fun dish being the tofu eggplant hot pot -which came so hot it was bubbling for a good five minutes!
So you get entertainment and a meal ;). Nice balance of hot, sweet and sour, a little bit too much thin sauce for my liking and I would’ve liked some shiitake mushroom in there , but that’s a personal choice.

The other dishes were your standard Chinese fare. The first was mixed greens with prawn which had the standard Chinese take away flavor. One which I hadn’t had since before glueing gluten-free so that was pretty fantastic. MSG enhanced? Highly likely. However I didn’t have the response to it so maybe not.

And the last was the recommendation by my server for the garlic ginger beef with snow peas. I’m still shocked at how much beef was on that plate - seriously look at the pictures. Very well seasoned, the beef was surprisingly tender considering it’s not a high-quality cut which means they braised it properly. veggies were perfect colour and crunchy texture   Could’ve done with a bit less oil but otherwise nice.

Obviously had a lot leftover to take away and they were great with the whole experience. no awkwardness. No fuss.  They brought really decent quality eco take away containers ( 🙏 ) then gave me the time and space to put my food the way that I wanted.

I had a happy belly, a very happy state of mind, good and ample leftovers and a great memory which will bring me back the next time I visit town."

Crispy and tasty, not too messy. I upgraded to yam fries. We also got the southwest bowl which was good! The desserts were ok but not the best.

The one thing is, it wasn’t busy or anything but I felt the service was very slow. Took a long time for them to come around to us. But the food is great ! The patio portion is heated and enclosed which is cool."

The crab cakes eggs benny is a must try!
Very flavorful crab cakes topped with sliced avocado and a perfectly poached egg, tasty potatoes on the side and a creamy and zesty hollandaise sauce to pour over top.

Buffalo chicken wings were thickly breaded and really delicious.

The seafood chowder was filled with yummy bites.

The french toast was amazing! It had so much flavour on it's own but then it was paired with fruits and a cinnamon whip on the side, you hardly have a need for any syrup.

The Reuben was juicy and not overly salty as others can be.

The calamari was a bit odd and the least flavorful thing I tried.

The steak was my absolute favourite dish, perfectly cooked with a delicious flavoured butter and nice crust on the outside and rich sauteed mushrooms.

The fish and chips were exactly what you'd expect and they do have good fries.

The cappuccino chocolate terrine dessert was nice and rich without being overly sweet, despite it missing the raspberry sauce as advertised. The chocolate was smooth and the almond bark on top was crunchy. I'm not actually sure where the cappuccino flavour is meant to be but I'm an espresso addict so I tend to not be able to taste coffee flavours unless they are overly pronounced."

The staff recommended “Crab Cake Eggs Benedict.” We both went with her recommendation. Wow, she was on point! Rich, tasty and melt in your mouth. Hubby loved it so much he ordered it again the next morning. The next morning I ordered “All Canadian breakfast” as I love scrambled eggs and chose rye bread, bacon and substituted potatoes with fruit.

I have to say the staff is amazing - attentive, genuine and down-to-earth.

Great breakfast to fuel us for the day full with walking. We ended up needing to walk off the wonderful meal along the harbour. Not a bad start to a day, eh!"

The food was surprisingly good. Much better than you'd expect of a hotel bar. Very reasonably priced as well. The wine list was pretty basic but the pricing was good. The room is kind of what you'd expect at a Marriot. Nothing to write home about but nice enough. The service was pretty bad though. Inattentive server and they weren't really able to answer any wine, drink or food questions. Too bad because the food was excellent."

I enjoy the somewhat open kitchen concept. You have to come up to the bar to order your food. The food is a hit/miss, the potatoes was a 3/10 very dilly. The Beef Tongue Reuben was a 7.7/10. First time trying beef tongue so it was good. The craft beer I ordered was okay. After you order your food, they don’t really check up on you and ask if you need anything else."

We ate outside in the marketplace square and shared the baba ghanouj and a pork belly sandwich. Each was big enough to serve two people so it's a good deal.

Visually inspirational for every dish we ordered. A mixture of different textures and tastes for each ingredient as those explode in mouth. Recommend their medium rare steak and seasonal berries as dessert.

Our return visit for we love the atmosphere and the waitress is approachable and friendly. Waiter and waitress know their dishes well. My only side suggestion is to approach the diners with questions while they’re not having a moment (Eg. laughing). Our conversation came to a hilarious end, as we try to hold on our laughter the waitress came dropping us with a question. Our moment of climatic enjoyment got cut off/ short since we had to quickly recover to respond. Here their timing is key."

Saveur Restaurant,French,"658 Herald Street Victoria, BC V8W 1S7 Canada",BC,48.4304579,-123.3654207,5,"We've been to Saveur a few times now.  Thought I'd post a review.

Prices are definitely on the higher side and portions are smaller as well, but the quality of food is excellent.

Started off with the soba noodles and rosti.  The soba noodles are to die for, although the portion was 1/4 of the size compared to when we ordered them which was a bit disappointing.

My fiancee got the tuna and I had the burger.  Everything was fantastic as usual.

We finished off by sharing lemon pudding which was amazing.

Service was outstanding (and was the two prior times we dined here).  Victoria doesn't have a plethora of fine dining experiences.  If you're looking for a fancier spot for a special night out, I'd highly recommend Saveur.

Bon appetit!"

Saveur Restaurant,French,"658 Herald Street Victoria, BC V8W 1S7 Canada",BC,48.4304579,-123.3654207,5,"Worth the splurge!!!  Yes it's expensive. And yes it was amazing! Good things are worth spending money on and if you've never had a fine dining meal, this should be on your local list to try! Service was attentive and on point. The meals were paired wonderfully with reds and whites appropriately. We started off with a super fun creative chai inspired whiskey sour! If James has it available, order it!!! When they say their tenderloin is like butter, it's true. And yes, you should pair wine with your dessert!
It's a small venue, with small tables but the service keeps on top of your table helping to avoid clutter. Thanks Chef, James, and Ryan for the great time!"

We went in 30-40min before closing because we had arrived in town later than expected, but their service was wonderful. Some places will show their frustration when you walk in late, I get it, but the servers here were professional, very friendly & helpful. I was trying to order everything all at once since they were taking last call but they have a wide selection so I was having a hard time choosing so the server helped recommend some items. Our waitress checked on us multiple times to make sure we were good.

Food also tasted very fresh & delicious. Sashimi pieces were nice & thick :) one of my favorite was the Tako Wasabi, will definitely wake you up. I'll definitely return when I visit the town again :)"

So it's listed in only one place, but in the end they will charge you more than that menu price."

Desserts were also delicious along with the Lime Ginger Cherry Soda.

====================================

I have now visited this place so many times that I can leave a solid review about it. In my heart this place is the true definition of a 4★ experience.

Beer selection, solid, nothing fancy, you gonna find something you like for sure. Are you going to find that special beer you've been looking for? Most likely not.

Food, solid. Whenever we are in a big group with multiple dietary restrictions, we come here as we can always find something for everyone. Yet none of the menu items alone stand out as the best in town for their category.

Service, solid. This of course changes depending on the server, how busy the place is and/or if there's an event going on. But overall I had 95%+ positive experiences. Yet none of them truly memorable.

A big thing they get is different nights for events, like sports events, trivia night and others things of the sort."
Yates Street Taphouse,Pubs,"759 Yates Street Victoria, BC V8W 1L6 Canada",BC,48.4259008,-123.3626286,5,Came here last Thursday and everyone was so friendly. There were 2 people at the host desk that were very nice. I sat at the bar and the bartender was really nice. I think there was a shift change happening at some point and the next bartender I got was super friendly and helpful as well. I got his awesome recommendation on a really tasty sour beer and I asked his recommendation on a good patio to check out. I would definitely come back here.

I’ve equally heard that some of the treatment of their employees could be better. I hope that gets better. Join their email list and find out when the good deals are. It’s not often but it’s worth it."

Nothing interesting for my taste buds unfortunately.
If this is Ethiopian food, then I won't eat it again in my life."

We picked chef choice dish. It turned out fantastic. Server super friendly. Parking was okay. A bit walking but best after dinner. Too much good food we needed to walk it off back to our car. We would definitely visit again in the future.

The food is so delicious here and the smell of the charred bread is divine. Our server, Anna, is so great! Love all her suggestions for food in both Victoria and Vancouver. She is also just super friendly to chat with. Lovely vibe as the evening progressed and had more people come in."
Stage,Wine Bars,"1307 Gladstone Avenue Victoria, BC V8R 1R9 Canada",BC,48.4303865,-123.3449193,1,"This is the most disappointing meal we have ever had on this island, we came to this restaurant with high expectations, the vibe of the restaurant is pretty good,  it the food is incomprehensible, we ordered feast set meal for 5 people, because the server said this is chef's choice, if we are very hungry, we can try it.

First, we got three pieces of burned bread and two kinds of cheese, and canned clams. The second dish was a plate of vegetable salad :)The third dish was a plate with two pieces of halibut, which tasted fine. When the fourth course two chocolate cake was served, we were shocked, paying $325 and getting this, After such an experience, we talked with server, he said about the price of the ingredients because of inflation, of course we know that everything is going up in price, but paying $325 for such 4 courses meal is unreasonable, I believe if we order all the food on the menu, it will not exceed this price.

In the end, our discussion did not have any results. The server dropped a machine with amount and said if you don’t wanna pay the tips, that’s is fine. Horrible night."

My Thai Cafe,Thai,"1020 Cook Street Victoria, BC V8V 3Z5 Canada",BC,48.4226833,-123.3545167,4,"Great local eatery. Lunch menu prices are really reasonable, generous portions and include soup and a spring roll. My partner did a fried egg add-on for an additional cost and it was great on the rice dish. Thai iced tea was decent, a little bit on the sweet side but not bad. Their pad Thai sauce is a little on the sour side for me and their mild seems a bit spicy (I would personally get no spice in my future visits). Hence the 4 stars."

After purposefully getting lost in locating a little place for dinner, I was pleasantly greeted by a very professional and polite and welcoming young man. I was happy to hear him welcome me and when I asked for take out he politely handed me I menu and took my order. After I sat he professionally offered me some water and even poured it for me which shows the etiquette of serving tables as being very impressive. I was delighted and felt at home immediately as I waited for my food. Upon returning home and opening my food I was eager to taste the flavors for I had asked for as spicy as possible. As I enjoyed my food I realize that this was a wonderful meal that had rich flavors, spiced and the right amount of temperature in spice as well as temperature of food. I would recommend this place and would only caution that though it is a small establishment it is huge in flavor and good quality food. My compliments to the chef."

I've had their ramen, it was flavourful with excellent noodles. Their new new curry bowl items are really tasty and generously portioned. The Karaage Don is also an excellent lunch option.

They're definitely under new management - lots of new faces and a much improved customer service experience. They also have a new expanded menu with more variations of each type of dish. Sakura has solidified it's place in my lunchtime rounds."
"Sakura Sushi, Grocery and Japanese Restaurant",Japanese,"1213 Quadra Street Victoria, BC V8W 2K6 Canada",BC,48.4251639,-123.3591699,3,"I love their sushi and other hot meals. However the last time I went there we ordered food for dine in at their outdoor table. I requested one of the ladies if they could reheat the cold meals that were on display since we were supposed to eat it there and she said it’s not possible. Seriously, why isn’t it allowed?? So we ended up eating the very cold takoyaki and other dish on display. I never came back after this, very disappointed.

Additional comment: with all due respect, but we also ordered hot meals and ate it on the outdoor table of your restaurant. So are you saying that even if we order hot meals we cannot have the additional grab and go food reheated in your microwave? How is that helping your customer, half the order is hot and half the order isn’t allowed to be reheated because it’s to go? If we knew about this in the first place we wouldn’t have ordered any to go with the hot meals.

I was a fan of your restaurant since we ate here multiple times, it wasn’t the first time. But to tell your customer to go eat somewhere else because reheating is a big deal shows the value you place on your once loyal customers. :( again we won’t mind if there’s a sign saying this.

P.s.

It might help to place a sign on the cold section that the food here cannot be reheated EVEN if customer orders hot meals, in that way it avoids confusion."

We had all vegetarian dishes minus one they put shredded scallops on so we just didn't eat it, but we didn't complain about it was too busy to bother. This place looks dated so the outside does not reflect the inside😉"
Golden City Restaurant,Chinese,"721 Fisgard Street Victoria, BC V8W 1R8 Canada",BC,48.4293234,-123.3632914,4,"Ordered from Golden city using their online system and enjoyed the convenience. I ordered vegtable chowmein with only beansprouts and two egg rolls. Golden city correctly made my order which I was worried about because I just wrote the ""only beansprouts"" into the comments. This showed me they pay attention to detail. The chowmein was a good large portion had great flavor and was a resonable price. The egg rolls were lackluster without much flavor and the wrapping was a bit thick for my liking.

Overall good meal and I would order again (just provide not the egg rolls next time)."
Sura Korean Cuisine,Korean,"1518 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 1C3 Canada",BC,49.2888512,-123.1316371,5,"I enjoyed the food here with my family 😊 portions are good. I just wish they could have more non spicy food for kids. They do charge a 15% service fee if your group has more than 6 people, which is like a tip, so it is reasonable."
Sura Korean Cuisine,Korean,"1518 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 1C3 Canada",BC,49.2888512,-123.1316371,5,"At SURA Korean Restaurant, one can anticipate a truly unique dining experience that perfectly melds traditional Korean flavors with a modern, sophisticated ambiance. From the moment you walk in, the welcoming atmosphere, resplendent with warm lights and comfortable seating, sets the tone for an excellent culinary journey.

The menu at SURA is a vibrant palette of Korean gastronomy, showcasing the rich, hearty flavors that the cuisine is known for. The Bulgogi, tender and succulently marinated, is an absolute must-try, as is the Bibimbap, served in a hot stone bowl, which creates an irresistible crispy rice layer at the bottom. The seafood pancake, brimming with fresh ingredients, is an ideal start to the meal.

Vegetarians and vegans aren’t left out either. SURA’s Japchae, a dish of stir-fried sweet potato noodles and vegetables, is an example of their commitment to catering to diverse dietary needs without compromising flavor.

One aspect that particularly stands out is the quality of their ingredients. The freshness of the vegetables, the quality of the meats, and the aromatic spices, all come together in a symphony of flavors that leaves one yearning for more.

Service at SURA matches the high standard set by their food. The staff is attentive, helpful with suggestions, and ensures a smooth dining experience.

In addition, the restaurant’s adherence to safety and hygiene protocols in these challenging times further enhances the overall experience, making you feel safe and comfortable.

Overall, SURA Korean Restaurant in Vancouver is a destination not just for those with a palate for Korean food but anyone who appreciates good food, well served. Highly recommended!"

We found a parking lot for $3 / hr across the back door in the street behind the restaurant. They have 4 free spots behind the back door but they were full.

We get the lunch set menu and got to try different things, all of which were good. Kids got a dumpling soup and kimchi fried rice. Portions were just right to fill us up."

The only thing to consider is they don’t take reservations and there is usually a wait list at this place.
Overall a “must try” for Korean food in Vancouver."
Sura Korean Cuisine,Korean,"1518 Robson Street Vancouver, BC V6G 1C3 Canada",BC,49.2888512,-123.1316371,5,"What a great place on Robson St for authentic Korean eats!

We actually tried coming here before but the line-up was too long of a wait. Fortunately we came again during foul weather earlier this month (December 2021) & yay, we got a table without delay. Had to call the restaurant to let them someone know we were outside, as patrons are required to stay outside until a staff member came out to assist. I appreciate the covid protocol (they do check for vax i.ds).

Their great ratings do not lie - the food is comforting and delicious. Portions are good considering the cost. The decor is light and minimal. Their staff are all excellent in friendliness, attentiveness and speed.

The potato pancakes had perfect crisp to it and were very flavourful on their own ~ no sauce really needed. The vegetarian japchae was so satisfying, that we didn’t even miss the meat.

I loved the grilled mackerel the most, not overly cooked, with a softly cooked interior while maintaining a crispy skin. It even came with a small Doenjang Jjigae ~ super flavourful soup broth with bits of beef.

All the ‘appies’ (kimchi, beans, potato salad) were a perfect sample taste. I wonder if I could have asked for more?

The staff were hospitable  and quick to serve and clear away.

Decor is modern, minimalistic yet relaxed.

I’m SO looking forward to coming back again!

Despite being really full they offered us complementary dessert because we were celebrating our anniversary! Our server was super kind and packed it up for us to eat later!

Picnic Too,Coffee & Tea,"1019 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8V 3K5 Canada",BC,48.4234258,-123.3560499,4,"Ordered the congee.

As a biased person being Asian, it was not the congee I expected especially visually. This one was outstanding with colors and textures. The bold ingredients were sitting atop a bed of thick brown rice. The rice was not too viscous and also not as fluid as Asian congee would be generally.  It might be close to the viscosity of oats where it will still fall out of your spoon if you tip it over but not immediately.

The temperature also is quite different.  I'm guessing this was about 50°C / 122°F.

So eating the congee, the ingredients were grouped together and arranged quite thoughtfully. I thought of mixing everything together just like you generally would in an Asian congee, but my senses at this point whispered otherwise.

So I went about my dish picking the ingredients, often combining 2-3 at a time as I was scouring away from the bed of viscous rice underneath. I found that eating it this way gives an easier time to distinguish and appreciate the flavors and textures as compared to having everything mixed together.  This made the dish quite engaging as you try different combinations of the ingredients. It was light yet felt.
Different from Asian congee and unique in it's way."

I understand that it can get busy during lunch hour but this is not what I can accept."
Kuma Noodles Japan,Ramen,"1551 Cedar Hill Cross Road Suite 215 Victoria, BC V8P 2P2 Canada",BC,48.4614663,-123.3347743,1,I have been eating here for years and this was the worst experience. Miso soup and  Gyoza were made by an older woman. The soup she gave me was only enough for half a bowl. The bottom of the dumplings were all mushy and tasted bitter.
Milestones,Canadian (New),"812 Wharf St Victoria, BC V8W 1T3 Canada",BC,48.4228659,-123.3689381,5,"My recent dining experience at Milestone restaurant in Victoria was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment we stepped in, we were captivated by the very beautiful view of the water, which set the perfect ambiance for a delightful meal.

The service at Milestone was impeccable, with attentive and friendly staff making us feel welcome and well taken care of throughout the evening. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and offered excellent recommendations, adding a personal touch to the overall dining experience.

Speaking of the menu, the food at Milestone was simply outstanding. Each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavors. We tried a variety of dishes, but the one that stood out the most was the beef taco. It was a delectable combination of tender beef, fresh ingredients, and a perfectly balanced seasoning that left our taste buds delighted.

In addition to the beef taco, the menu offered an array of mouthwatering options to suit different palates, and each dish was crafted with precision and creativity.

The restaurant's waterfront location not only provided a stunning view but also added a soothing atmosphere to the dining experience. We enjoyed watching the sun setting over the water while savoring our scrumptious meal.

Overall, I highly recommend Milestone restaurant for a memorable dining experience in Victoria. The combination of the picturesque waterfront view, excellent service, and delightful food, especially the beef taco, made our visit truly memorable. Whether you're looking for a romantic dinner or a gathering with friends, Milestone is the perfect place to indulge in a memorable culinary journey."

Fish Tacos with Fries, Sweet & Fire Cauliflower, Margarita, Peach Bellini were all delicious.

Food was fresh and drinks were strong!  Plenty of outdoor seating. Family friendly, close to the water. Highly recommend if your in the area."

Food continues to be very good and service is attentive.   We cleaned our plates!

But let’s be honest, the highlight is the people watching you do!"

I had my baby with me and they were able to provide a high chair and bring water for his bottle when I needed it.
This restaurant has some really fun cocktails and lots of choice on their menu for a special night out. The view of the harbour was a lovely addition to a great meal. This restaurant would be a good choice for a party or date."

Our food was amazing and the view can't be beat, we were just so cold even when they moved a heater close to us. The seafood platter more than feeds 2 adults. I had the top sirloin steak and it was cooked to perfection at medium rare. We were with friends and the other meals were steamed mussels and clams, fish and chips and pepperoni pizza. Everyone left full and happy. I'd say this was more spendy than many other restaurants in the area but totally worth it."
Steamship Grill & Taphouse,Seafood,"470 Belleville Street Victoria, BC V8V 1W9 Canada",BC,48.421105,-123.3713739,1,"I came here with ten people. Unfortunately, we were all disappointed. Terrible service is an under statement. The food took over 45 mins to arrive. The food portions are small. The calamari which says is for two people isn’t enough to fill one person up. We were waiting for water for at least 15 mins. We were sitting outside and had no heaters next to us and they had none available. I left the restaurant still hungry. Overall, I am extremely disappointed."
Steamship Grill & Taphouse,Seafood,"470 Belleville Street Victoria, BC V8V 1W9 Canada",BC,48.421105,-123.3713739,3,The fish and chips were good but the clam chowder was like soup and tasted bland. They also got the kind of salad wrong. When another person in the group ordered a vegan burger and asked about the fries being cooked in the same oil as the meat and then ordered a salad. When the salad came it had cheese on it and other non vegan things. We also ordered sparkling water that never came to the table.

Ramen Arashi is the best I’ve had by far, and I cant get enough of their spicy tonkatsu. The broth is very flavorful and the chashu just melts in your mouth.

The restaurant works like a well oiled machine. All staff are well trained and good at what they do. Its a busy place and the staff handle it with grace. Thank you for great food and service!"

Both were so flavourful. Very delicious. The lemongrass flavour is what really kicks it up a notch.

We're from Vancouver, and we have great Vietnamese restaurants. This place is as good, if not better, than places back home. That's a huge compliment! Congrats Victoria, you have a winner!"

The spring roll was a very generous portion, it was super big from being deep-fried. Very cozy and comfortable atmosphere. One note: do not order the spicy meatball soup unless you eat very spicy! It is actually spicy (and my friend couldn’t handle it haha) but very delicious flavors nonetheless. But they do mean it when they say spicy! :) Highly recommend."

The sushi roll is not good, however the truffle fries are to die for. I had better Salmon at Vista 18, but Earls is really really good too, big portion and juicy, cooked right- however Earls should work on their rice that they use for sushi/mains. Presentation and side combinations are well thought; the sushi and fries could use a bit more of included sides, but you can always ask for more if the default portion isn’t enough. Non Alc beers are on the expensive side."

I really like their drink selections, I would highly recommend their Sangrias. The Watermelon Slush is really good too! Although their happy hour menu has changed I really liked their Calamari and Kale and Mushroom Pizza! The Clam Chowder is really good too! I highly recommend getting the Truffle Fries and Spinach Dip as appetizers. Their chicken tacos are also pretty good too! Dessert wise I really like their Toffee Chocolate Pudding. Overall my experience at Earls has been 10/10!"

The food is good but not exceptional and it does not justify the price charged : $25 for a salad and the same price for a basic bacon burger!
The terrace is nice, I was able to go there with my dog.

Second experience more than satisfactory, top cocktails (hawaiian mai tai, marylin monroe, blue hawaian) and seafood tower ($120) excellent and perfect for 2 people!
It's one of the best places to enjoy a good cocktail in victoria (many are either not dosed enough in alcohol, or tasteless or too many ice cubes)"

There’s not a lot open late in Victoria so this is a good option for a decent selection. The rare steak was very good, the truffle fries were really good. The rest was just OK.

The new truffle ravioli was disappointing and I got it with the prawns but they were pathetically small and underwhelming (not worth the extra $). The ravioli was good but felt a bit undercooked, the sauce was a bit watery and didn’t adhere to the pasta well.

The Cajun chicken was tasty and not dry, the ribs were a little dry. It came with potato salad which was kind of bland.

The atmosphere in here is nice and decent service! Good location, but if you’re driving since it’s downtown you need to take a bit of time to park."

Everything was super fresh, perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious😋!! The house made spring rolls are the best we’ve ever had, super crispy without being greasy and the filling is so good! We also ordered a container of their in-house made peanut sauce for home use, which is unlike any other peanut sauce we’ve tried…it’s the perfect thickness, made with actual peanuts (unlike most out there that are just watered down sweetened store bought peanut butter).

I ordered the Tantanmen and it was pretty good! I liked how there was bean sprouts and the iconic swirly fishcake and of course bok choy. The only thing I would say tho is I felt like the broth was a little too salty. But overall it’s a pretty good ramen. I also ordered the shrimp tempura, which was really yummy too!

Menbow Ramen Bar,Ramen,"1018 Blanshard Street Victoria, BC V8W 2H5 Canada",BC,48.423894,-123.362935,4,"A well-thought out ramen restaurant. Restaurant is clean and tidy with attentive waitresses. The menu shows a variety of ramen options such as pork, chicken, or clear (vegan?) broth base. There are ones without broth such as tantan, stirred, or rice available. There are also side dishes to compliment to the order or not.

Miso pork broth ramen is delicious. The bowl comes with large cuts of BBQ pork, bamboo shoots, finely diced green onion, corn nibs, half of an marinated egg, nori sheet, Japanese seasoning, and a couple more. It isn’t salty. Overall there’s a lot going on with each bite a diner wont be bored of it.

On to the didn’t meet expectation part. I may be off but I guess the noodle is generic noodle kind one could purchase from market. Not sure if this has anything to do with the food but I felt super thirsty about two hours after dinning.

In general, this place is a nice option for downtown dining."

Here for Happy Hour in the bar. Great prices for both drinks and food. Bartenders are extremely friendly and helped us plan our weekend stay in town."
LURE Restaurant & Bar,Seafood,"100 Harbour Road Victoria, BC V9A 0G1 Canada",BC,48.4268102,-123.3752044,3,"Let’s start with the positive. View is extraordinary, you get to see the inner harbour from a very good angle. Staff are friendly and helpful. Now the terrifying part is the food which is a hit and miss. Chicken wings were amazing. Burger, sandwich, and fish and chips were horrifying. It’s hard to screw up fish and chips on the island. So many other places do it so well. The batter was very thick AND soft. Thick batter we have seen, but soft thick uncooked batter is weird. As for the the burger and sandwiches, bacon was very hard, patty all you taste is salt, and the buns were quite burned. Fries, some were not folly cooked. Manager was quick to address our experience. People here are nice, but I don’t know if I would risk the chance for the food though."

As a solo diner, I didn’t feel slighted and was seated at a window table.  I had the spaghetti bolognese on day 1 and returned to have steak & prawns with the house salad on day 2.  I was a happy grandma.  Thanks, Julie!"

The best oysters Rockefeller I've ever had anywhere, and I've tried it everywhere! Ordered take-out, and my orders were ready not more than 15 mins after calling them in - insanely quick given the quality of the cuisine! This will become a regular stop for me whenever I find myself in Victoria again. First class!"
Victoria Harbour House Restaurant,Steakhouses,"607 Oswego St Victoria, BC V8V 4W9 Canada",BC,48.4211323,-123.3744302,2,"Service was good. But non-alcoholic cocktails contain alcohol. 5 months ago, I had gastric cancer surgery. so absolutely alcohol is dangerous to me. also, my friend's food has a kitchen iron brush.

Tacos are big and filling and priced well. They are well presented and put together. We had the Fish, Cauliflower, Carnita and Bean tacos, delightful. The Guacamole and chips are yummy too, the chips are nice and crunchy with the right amount of seasoning. Definitely recommend. It's our favorite place for tacos any day of the week 😋"

La Taqueria,Mexican,"766 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8W 1H2 Canada",BC,48.4245444,-123.3632873,3,"I've been a loyal patron of this Victoria Taqueria for years whenever I visit from California. The service has consistently been outstanding, deserving a 5-star rating, and the inviting atmosphere never fails to impress. The food has always been a delightful experience, offering truly authentic Mexican cuisine that tantalizes my taste buds on every visit. However, today I was greatly disappointed. The food was prepared poorly, with overcooked dishes and an excessive use of cooking oil. The tacos lacked any distinct flavor, overwhelmed by the taste of oil, and were noticeably overdone. On a positive note, the beverages were excellent, the service remained fantastic, and atmosphere of the restaurant has a great vibe. Considering the price I paid for lunch, I expected a far superior experience reminiscent of my previous visits. I'm pretty sure this was my last visit to this restaurant."

It was whipped and had a weird texture like the stuff you get out of bags. It was unappetizing. Ordered 4 tacos and they were all soggy and had hardly any filling. I absolutely love Mexican food and am shocked that this place is so popular. Had really high hopes. Not to mention service was sooooo slow, took them 20 minutes just to take our order."

But came here tonight to meet up with one of my acquaintance. The food's alright but service was only satisfactory. Still a good place to chill and have a good hang. Food value seems decent.
The Old Spaghetti Factory,Italian,"703 Douglas Street Victoria, BC V8W 2B4 Canada",BC,48.4203731,-123.3661269,4,I was very impressed that they could accommodate a table of 8 at 5:30 on a Friday so quickly. The restaurant is huge so I understood more as we were seated. The design of the restaurant was good but fairly basic and comfortable. It was very busy but I felt like they did a great job getting food and drinks to us. The value of the food was pretty good and they have a great food and beverage selection. The kids meals were generous and tasty. I had the seafood fettuccine Alfredo and I found it quite watery and bland. My sister has the manicotti and she thought it was good. A good family restaurant with mid to high prices.

I don’t take a picture of my food but, because I was so starving that evening so, I forgot to take some pictures. Everything was absolutely delicious and amazing supper. Their warm bread with whipped garlic butter were top notch! Keep asking them to refill and they bring it up on the table. Always make reservation before otherwise you will be waiting for a long time to get your table. And because they are busy, just be patience and be kind to the waitress. They serve you really well."

We waited for over 10 minutes before a waitress came to our table. She was rude, not helpful and dismissive. When we finally got our meal she forgot the cream for my tea and although I reminded her she didn't bring it. I finally asked another woman if I could have some.
I also asked 3 times for the jam I had told her I wanted when I gave her my original order. Although she said yes twice, it never appeared. One of the worst breakfasts I've had and the Welsh rarebit that my partner had was not edible. After all this when we asked for the check she didn't bring it. We finally went to the bar to pay it. Needless to say with no tip, which rarely happens with us. We are 20% tippers.
I would never eat here again......nor should you 😂"

We have been twice in our first four days here on the island. Friday night for fish and chips and French onion soup, then on Monday for Full Tea and the Original Burger and fries. The place is a nice old fashioned pub, with a white exterior and large black beams. Inside is full of great old tables and chairs.
Our food was wonderful every time we went.
I had been looking for a place with the English pub feeling and Afternoon Tea at a fair price. They have several Tea choices, full tea was only $28!"

We came for afternoon tea which was quite enjoyable. The wait staff were very efficient and also quite casual. It wasn’t bad at all, just not the tearoom experience we were expecting. It felt a bit like having afternoon tea in a snug, pub or bar."

I ordered a coffee and the shortrib eggs benny, the first mug she gave had a lipstick mark on which was replaced when asked. The eggs benny there was plenty of shortrib but lacking of flavor and salt! I don't usually add extra salt after food is served but I had to. The only tasty thing was their parmesan potatoes! I would try a dinner to give them another chance."
Omakase Izakaya & Sushi Bar,Japanese,"990 Blanshard Street Victoria, BC V8W 2H3 Canada",BC,48.4234351,-123.3629505,4,"Good service. Not too crowded. Excellent service. The waitress and host were very attentive and friendly.

I shared the Omakase with one other person which was enough.  It's not really an omakase but it plated quite appealingly and I like the novelty.

There were some questionable items however. I wasn't a big fan of the shrimp dumplings ha gow and the bao bun as they seemed to me very put of place. Both were very underwhelming in taste and texture.

The  yuzu sauce paired perfectly with the raw oysters however.  Takoyaki and squid skewer were unremarkable but tasty nonetheless.

I'd probably not recommend the omakase as items are hit and miss."

Pretty comprehensive sake selection which you can see they take seriously, with menus telling you about the level of polish on the rice.

We had the chef's sashimi platter which was really nice. Staff were all great too.

They have a nice range of Japanese whisky too, and they do flights :)"

Got the Shokado bento box, which features 9 small dishes of raw and cooked food curated by the chef. This is great for sharing with 1 other friend.

This traditional bento box contains gorgeous dishes; the 9 dishes consisted of: 2 types of sashimi, sushi roll, tuna tataki salad, fresh oysters, shrimp dumplings (har gow), fried mini octopus skewers, shrimp bao, and takoyaki. My favourite is the tuna tataki salad - delicious tuna and dressing. Even though cute, the har gow seemed out of place since I associate that with Chinese cuisine and I've definitely had better at dim sum restaurants."

Don’t sleep on the Moriawase 126, Jackie Chan oshi, Oroku Saki roll, and Bulgogi Pasta (my favourites). Their happy hour is also a great time to try lots of small dishes and taste a wide variety of drinks. I come here almost every week to eat and post photos/reviews at @vicflavours"

I got the Island Bowl and was seriously impressed… the fish just tastes so fresh and has an irresistible marinade coating. All the ingredients were bursting with flavor and worked together so well… was a bit steep at $15-20 per bowl but ended up being so good that I’d go again.

Definitely recommend trying this place!"
Island Poké,Poke,"1674 Douglas Street Victoria, BC V8W 2G6 Canada",BC,48.4290536,-123.3648556,5,Delicious poke with crunchy and umami toppings. Requested the tangerines on the side and the service kindly put the portion into small containers.

All kinds of choices for your bowl. You can pretty much have it made the way you want it. The service was great we got to watch our food be made right in front of us. Stayed at the restaurant to eat, and this little place was cozy.
I'm not much for raw sushi type foods. I'll tell you one thing,, I was impressed and probably will go back."

I didn’t have high expectations of this restaurant given its location, but what a nice surprise!

Google review did not disappoint, the service was second to none, we honestly felt like having dined at a friend’s house. Everyone was so friendly, served us spring rolls on the house, gave my parents bubble tea samplers, took time to chat with us, and made sure to make the food extra soft for my senior parents.

The decor is quite charming, there is a world map where customers pin where they are from on the map, it’s almost full. :)"

Our meal here was a highlight of our 5 day stay here in Victoria!  We ordered the meal for four plus an extra entree and with 3 hungry teenagers we had leftovers.  The food pleased the picky eaters and the food snobs alike in our big family.  We all got bobba tea and decided the real fruit tea was the best.  If the great food wasnt enough to make you happy, the joyful service and human love exuding from the service would make it a joyful family dinner as well.  If everyone were as kind and friendly as these wonderful people what a world it would be.  If only i lived here in Victoria, i would be a regular here!"
The Flying Otter,Seafood,"950 Wharf Street Victoria, BC V8W 1C6 Canada",BC,48.4237828,-123.3712407,5,"Not sure why I don't come to this restaurant more often; I enjoyed the ambiance, location, food, and menu items.  It's a reasonable place to take someone for a date- however not too intimate, pretty casual for a setting.

Date dinner with the Hubby almost a month ago (haven't reviewed), didn't know it was two for one appetizer Saturdays. OF COURSE we ordered the two-for-one! Why not? It's there, if it wasn't something we enjoyed, we didn't have to order it or come back, so there was nothing to lose.

Had no regrets on the selection; ordered the wings with Apple BBQ flavour, and the calamari. Be warned, the calamari does have some spicy kick to it- and I like spicy. Still delicious. Wings were crispy, even with the sauce- just a personal preference.

For the entrees my husband ordered the Halibut burger - but somehow ended up with the two-piece halibut fish and chips- he went with it, and didn't have any regrets. The batter wasn't overly thick, and the fish was thankfully not dry. My own order was spicy prawn tacos, and they were lovely. nice, light, refreshing. It comes with a side, but thankfully I chose this, because the appetizers were filling enough. The fries were nothing remarkable, but I did enjoy them.

We arrived around 5:30pm, to which dinner was just getting started- the tables were about 90% full, and our food still arrived at a ""reasonable time"" (we were in and out in an hour, without rushing our order and dinner).  The atmosphere was overall good; didn't feel rushed, didn't feel like we were inconveniencing anyone when we asked for refills of our drinks. I will, of course, come back again. Even for a somewhat price-conscious person, I'm very satisfied with my visit.

Highlights for me:
Accessible washroom
Two-for-one Appetizer Saturdays (excluding a few items)
Easy parking
Good service and food

Take note:
No dog patio"

The Flying Otter,Seafood,"950 Wharf Street Victoria, BC V8W 1C6 Canada",BC,48.4237828,-123.3712407,5,We sat in the patio and had a pilsener and an apple cider while we waited for our Caesar salad and halibut fish and chips. The food was great. some of the best fish and chips I'd had. I'd recommend a bit more dressing on the salad but the fried capers that it came with were a nice touch. Our server was attentive but not over bearing. Would go again.
The Flying Otter,Seafood,"950 Wharf Street Victoria, BC V8W 1C6 Canada",BC,48.4237828,-123.3712407,5,"Found this place while wandering aimlessly around Victoria. We loved the name and decided to give it a try. It was a little busy, but the hostess gave us the option to sit at the bar. I'm so glad we did. The Otter has an excellent drink selection, including local brews. We split an order of poutine (IYKYK) that was absolutely fantastic! We loved watching the activity on the docks as we ate, including one seagull that liked to look in the windows to see what people were eating.

The staff were amazing and friendly from the jump. They also worked incredibly well together, anticipating what others needed, which increased the level of customer care and service. They elevated the experience tenfold."
The Flying Otter,Seafood,"950 Wharf Street Victoria, BC V8W 1C6 Canada",BC,48.4237828,-123.3712407,3,"A cute view of the harbour sitting at a high-top table. The chowder was very good. I had the salmon tacos with a salad on the side. If you're doing this, try a different side than salad. I don't recommend. The side salad on its own was fantastic but was basically the same ingredients in the salmon taco. There was no variation in my lunch. The salmon was a very small piece on a huge bed of salad. Couldn't really taste anything but salad. My partner had the fish and chips. The fries/chips were great and the fish was battered lightly and was fresh.  He had no tartar sauce given though. Isn't that a fish and chips staple? I left hungry and unsatisfied with the salmon taco. I have to go back to try again."

I had high hopes after reading the blurb on their website.  I went for porchetta and for meatballs, planning a take-out order for meal prep at home.  It was on a Monday, around noon, and the market was nearly empty.  At Roast I saw the porchetta on offer, and decided to pass on that.  I spoke to the server, and ended up settling for ""a cup of balls"", a container with some arrabiata and four meatballs.  The next day I made a meatball sub with part of my order, and this is what I found:  irregularly shaped meatballs, very crumbly, in a small amout of sauce which had a rather thick layer of solidified fat on top...out of the fridge, of course...and I used two meatballs for my toasted sandwich, which was okay.  I can cook, so I did a good job on the prep.  As I said, it was an okay sandwich.  Three stars.  My hopes were aimed higher, but I am glad I made the effort to check Roast out. I plan to keep on looking for good meatballs in Victoria!"

The beef sandwich we got had a thick peice of broccoli on it that wasn't even done defrosting yet.
The side potatoes where cold aswell! Went back to look for the person manning the front to complain, and found no one there!"

Roast,Sandwiches,"1701 Douglas Street Unit 6 Victoria, BC V8W 0C1 Canada",BC,48.4298795,-123.3640647,2,"Went here based off recommendation from Tasting Victoria to get their pulled pork sandwich, which looked really delicious in the photo. Unfortunately, they were not serving this sandwich today, so we tried the regular pork sandwich instead. The staff were pleasant but the sandwiches were disappointing especially for $14 a sandwich. The pork was cold, the bread was cold and the sandwich came smooshed and looked unappealing. It felt like something we could have slapped together at home for much cheaper. Based on the other reviews it seems like consistency is a challenge for this establishment and perhaps we came on the wrong day."

The quality of the food was like it was cooked yesterday and heated in the microwave. The price points are simply way too high for the quality of the food.

It was very busy when we visited and the staff were friendly and prompt. It took a while to get our food (25 mins) but we knew that when we ordered.

The food was good. I had the fried chicken sandwich and it was tasty. The side of poutine wasn't great, but it was serviceable.

I would go back again, maybe for their Trivia Night as it looked those folks were having a great time."

And on top of that food was so delicious. I am vegetarian and it is difficult to find tasty option in Victoria, but La Taquisa is one of the best place for veg people like me. I would highly recommend to try Tortila soup. 🫶🏼"

Excellent every time we go, I recommend the chicken mole burrito. Lots of spice levels and flavour profiles to choose from if you like a lot or a little.

The staff is absolutely great - friendly, helpful and patient.

Nice indoor eating space, but options to sit outdoors in the front on the street or in the courtyard at the back (we didn’t know it was there the first time we came!)."
La Taquisa,Mexican,"1017 Blanshard Street Victoria, BC V8W 2H4 Canada",BC,48.4239623,-123.3623852,5,"Authentic Mexican food, like for real. I had a giant burrito with Beef Al Pastor. The meat was so soft and tasty, combined with marvelous beans and cheese that are nothing like you would ever experience at a Tex-Mex Americanized place.

Now the salsa, oh boy the green salsa, savory salsa made just right to be flavourful while still mild. I combined that with some sour cream, perfect match for me. I could eat a whole meal of just chips with this.

A friend of mine ordered their small quesadillas and they looked just as good, I can't wait to try some next time."

The setup was very nicely done and the food was wonderful.  Everyone asked me where I ordered the food from.  For the first time out of all the monthly lunches, I didn't have any leftovers. Unfortunately, I couldn't take pictures of all the food but I managed to get a few. Look at that guacamole!!! "

They were out of limes, which is fine as we thought the ones at home should work fine.

We ordered two 5 taco deals with a mix of beef, fish and shrimp to try them out. We came home and opened the box and were shocked by what we found. Tacos with barely any toppings, fish ripped to shreds, little to no seasoning or toppings on the beef and some of the tacos were under-cooked. They were basically tacos with a bit of some sauce and pieces of shredded lettuce. That too with unseasoned meat and ripped oily breaded fish. We were very disappointed, as I was personally looking forward to having tacos tonight. Bummer. Did like their salsas and Valentino sauce was nice and spicy, but the tacos themselves are underwhelming compared even to other places we’ve tried in the city. Again, bummer as the staff was nice."

The food, beer and service was all top notch and all of the staff we spoke to was exceptional. After the match we somehow ended up speaking to the owner, Jeremy, and he seemed as if he really cared about his pub and the people and the staff.

I couldn't rate the experience any better and next time we're in Victoria we'll definitely come back.

Thanks for the experience"

QV Cafe & Bakery,Bakeries,"1701 Government Street Victoria, BC V8W 1Z4 Canada",BC,48.4295811,-123.3666938,5,"I recently visited QV Bakery to order a cheesecake for my husband's birthday, and I just have to say - the experience was absolutely fantastic! From the moment I called to make the order, the staff was friendly and welcoming, and they helped me to choose the perfect cheesecake to suit my husband's tastes.

The cake itself was absolutely scrumptious - it was so creamy and rich, with a perfectly smooth texture and just the right amount of sweetness. The crust was also delicious, with a lovely crunch and a light, buttery flavor that complemented the cheesecake perfectly.

Overall, I was extremely impressed with the quality of the cheesecake and the level of care and attention that went into creating it. The team at QV Bakery clearly takes pride in their work, and it really shows in the finished product.

I would definitely recommend this bakery to anyone looking for delicious, high-quality baked goods - whether you're in the mood for a sweet treat like a cheesecake or something savory like a fresh-baked loaf of bread, you can't go wrong with QV Bakery. Thanks for making my husband's birthday so special!"

The only downside (or upside depending on the person) to the beautiful outside seating is sometimes the sea planes fly closely overhead. My table and I were personally not bothered by this and most of us thought it was cool. I opted to try a raspberry Moscow mule which I was pleasantly surprised by. It was not too sweet and in my opinion better than the regular. The waitress was very kind, bubbly, and knowledgeable. They were very cautious with any dietary restrictions and had plenty of options to substitute. I would strongly recommend the Laguna Beach Chicken Bowl. It was a great blend of flavors and the perfect size. I would've liked there to be more chicken but the pieces I did have were delicious. I didn't get a chance to go inside and see what it looked like but from the outside looking in, it looked fresh and modern with a very summer vibe to it where I could see my friends and I getting together and hanging out. All in all a great family dinner that we all enjoyed and the food left me wanting more!"

The food was decent, although I wished for a better menu selection. However, the beer selection was somewhat limited, which left room for improvement. Although the beers I tried were of good quality, the lack of variety on the flight was disappointing. With a broader selection, this place has the potential to become a go-to destination for beer enthusiasts. Nonetheless, the friendly staff and inviting atmosphere made the visit memorable. If you have the chance, don't miss the opportunity to enjoy their patio or balcony seating during the summer."

The papaya salad was nice balanced flavour with sour sweet and a bit hint of spicy. The green curry was soooo good! Creamy and not too rich or too sweet. The noodles was really good too! I like this better than pad Thai! Would definitely go back there and try more of their food
The coconut soup is so creamy and so good! Never had such rich soup before! It’s well balanced with lemon flavour in it"
Fan Tan Cafe,Chinese,"549 Fisgard Street Victoria, BC V8W 1R5 Canada",BC,48.429243,-123.3678711,2,"Well...This isn't Chinese food. An edible attempt, but not Chinese food. Food is meh. Decor is extremely questionable for an Asian restaurant, even an 'eclectic' one. Staff was accommodating and nice. Food came out with reasonable speed, with effort on  presentation. Portion sizes are large, but it's still very pricy, especially for mediocre food.

Description says they specialize in bubble tea but there was no bubble tea on the lunch menu (I looked). We ordered the ginger beef combo, one wonton soup, and the daily special (which is the same every day, by the way). I believe that was pork, fried noodles and fried shrimp on bean sprouts.

Wonton soup broth tasted exactly like chicken broth with more salt. Frozen wontons. So, so, disappointing. There might have been beef in the Ginger Beef or maybe it was just skinny strips of fried batter dunked in sweet sauce with ginger chunks. The fried shrimp had bland batter. Bean sprouts no flavor at all. Saving grace is sweet and sour pork as well as fried rice were were fine.

The staff came over to ask us if everything was OK... Well yeah, it was OK. So that's  what we said. I didn't think asking for home made broth simmered for hours, or more meat would be very feasible for the staff.

About the decor... The ceiling is literally spray painted black with extra holes punched in the ceiling for lights to look like stars? Maybe? But it looks bad in the daylight. The art is OK on its own, honestly, it just makes the whole thing look like an attempt at an avant-garde nightclub. Seats on the wall have tiny thin cushions to sit on. And it's kind of dirty. There was a napkin and crumbs on the floor left by a customer who ate there and left. No one cleaned it up, just started moving the tables for the next guests. Snapping the fan on this one."

The food was very good for Chinese food though the pork for the sweet and sour chicken was a bit too fatty. The service here was awful. The server was rude and watched expectantly at the screen when we were giving the tip. She was also were snippy about everything. The atmosphere was alright and the bathrooms were nice. I might come back here again for the food but definitely only because of that. I would maybe recommend this place to others.
Fan Tan Cafe,Chinese,"549 Fisgard Street Victoria, BC V8W 1R5 Canada",BC,48.429243,-123.3678711,4,The food was quite good. The won ton soup had a favorable brith and was full of good ingredients.  There is quite a difference in sizes. The medium is definitely a meal. I had the daily special & it was a good size. The breaded shrimp had a little too much breading. The noodles were delicious.  I just didn't like the black walls but at lunch it wasn't too dark. I would go again.
5th Street Bar & Woodfire Grill,American (Traditional),"1028 Hillside Avenue Victoria, BC V8T 2A3 Canada",BC,48.4397884,-123.3582633,4,"Maybe I'm ordering the wrong items, or my taste buds are wonky?

Highlights:
Great service
Atmosphere
Location
Saw a number of group tables which looked happy
Wheelchair accessible (looked like it to me, which is nice)

Extra things to consider:
Parking

My experiences won't really stop me from coming back. We have family dinners for peoples birthdays and we manage to rotate as best as we could around restaurants in Victoria, so I'm sure someone will choose this place as a venue again.

Overall, family members (party of 9) mostly were pleased with their meal. All of us was happy with the service. We didn't feel forgotten, or felt like we were inconveniencing them.  Atmosphere is always consistent and warm when you walk in. The outdoor patio looks comfortable.

My only complaint is the food... never seems to be enough in fries (ok sorry, I guess potatoes are going up in price). My husband ordered the strips and fries (strips are always good, with the honey mustard), but the fries portion keeps seemingly getting smaller every year we come back. My pizza was good, but just good; seemed more like a fancy flat bread. It felt like it was alright, but felt like something was missing. The Artichoke dip was flavourful, no complaints there- nicely cheesy, had good consistency, didn't feel like we were really saving on portions so much.

Since the place does get busy, it's good to maybe note that parking could get tricky. We had to park a little further down at the residential street.

Again, maybe I'm just nit-picking, but I'll probably be back. I will just say the service is always good."

Chicken On the Run,Chicken Wings,"405 Craigflower Road Victoria, BC V9A 2V7 Canada",BC,48.4363061,-123.3874257,5,"Ordered the Hungry man (6 pc chicken, with fries and coleslaw) for pick up. Plenty of parking. Staff was friendly. The fried chicken is juicy and the batter is tasty as is the chicken. Their home fry wedges are excellent. It's fried with what's like tempura batter. The coleslaw was okay. Would definitely order here again. Note that this place has only about 6 seats so it's more for either pickup or delivery."
Chicken On the Run,Chicken Wings,"405 Craigflower Road Victoria, BC V9A 2V7 Canada",BC,48.4363061,-123.3874257,4,"FOOD: This is the best fried chicken in town! Just like mom used to buy! Plus they also do milkshakes! Skip the fast food joint and have some local fried chicken instead. Delicious.

SERVICE: The staff are friendly and provide excellent service.

Accessibility: Ground level concrete entrance onto tile floor. No tables, a small 32 inch high counter seating with free-standing bar stools. Counter to order and pay is 48 inch high. No customer bathrooms."
Chicken On the Run,Chicken Wings,"405 Craigflower Road Victoria, BC V9A 2V7 Canada",BC,48.4363061,-123.3874257,5,This place has CRISPIEST and JUICIEST fried chicken I have ever had. I got a chance to try their ginger beef as well. It was delicious! highly recommended. Staff were wonderful! Will definitely go back there!!
Chicken On the Run,Chicken Wings,"405 Craigflower Road Victoria, BC V9A 2V7 Canada",BC,48.4363061,-123.3874257,3,I thought Chicken on the run and Crown Palace are two separate restaurants but turned out they’re one that makes it easier to order. Many people likes fried chicken here but for me they’re too salty. Even though the skin was thin and crispy but I couldn’t eat more than one piece. Their wedges were very good though. The other dish I order was ginger beef chow mein were just okay. Service was on time and friendly.
10 Acres Kitchen,Bars,"614 Humboldt Street Victoria, BC V8W 1A4 Canada",BC,48.4229949,-123.3679192,5,"10 acres delivers! the food is delicious, looks great and all from their own farm.
Make sure to make a reservation so you get a great table.
We had the chicken and mussels,  I feel it was a mistake. Should have stuck with one theme. Either seafood. Or no seafood.
The chicken was very very good.
I’d have it again."
10 Acres Kitchen,Bars,"614 Humboldt Street Victoria, BC V8W 1A4 Canada",BC,48.4229949,-123.3679192,5,"Lovely atmosphere! Nice staff and quality food!
Incredible dishes and well designed menu! Had been there for breakfast and lunch, loved it both."
10 Acres Kitchen,Bars,"614 Humboldt Street Victoria, BC V8W 1A4 Canada",BC,48.4229949,-123.3679192,5,"A farm to table restaurant. We walked in on a Saturday night and were seating right away. The restaurant is very big. There was a section with a bar with a younger ground, another sections with larger groups and family and then another area that seemed to be more intimate. Everything that we ordered was delicious- gnocchi, lasagna, and pumpkin cheesecake. Highly recommend the pumpkin cheesecake (without the apple compote and lemon-those flavours didnt go well together for my palate) I would say it’s the best I’ve had. Service was great. I would definitely go back!"
10 Acres Kitchen,Bars,"614 Humboldt Street Victoria, BC V8W 1A4 Canada",BC,48.4229949,-123.3679192,4,"Stopped in without resos for lunch, we were seated on the “indoor patio” which has a great vibe. Came in for an app and aperol spritz. Excellent atmosphere. Food was good, fresh and unique. They had a mix up with their bar order so they were out of Prosecco, which is fine..sh!t happens! Def coming back!"
10 Acres Kitchen,Bars,"614 Humboldt Street Victoria, BC V8W 1A4 Canada",BC,48.4229949,-123.3679192,4,We just ordered some drinks. Beautiful interior design! I loved how they incorporated plants into their outside patio. Most of their drinks include alcohol so it is not so much friendly for those who are avoiding alocholic drinks.
Rise & Grind,Coffee & Tea,"1294 Broad Street Victoria, BC V8W 2A5 Canada",BC,48.426279,-123.366511,5,"Rise and Grind on Broad Street is easily my favourite go-to casual breakfast, brunch, and coffee destination in downtown Victoria. The food options are diverse and made to order, plus the brewed fresh Discovery Coffee is always a hit. Highly recommended, never disappointed."

Rise & Grind,Coffee & Tea,"1294 Broad Street Victoria, BC V8W 2A5 Canada",BC,48.426279,-123.366511,1,"The girl taking my order was polite & friendly.
The food was definately sub-par. The toasted sandwich I ordered was barely warm... not crisp like toasted it should be. For $11 I expected a lot more of each filling described on the menu. If the owners spent 50 cents to make this I would be surprised. When my order was ready, I just got hollered at by a number. I had to get up twice as my drink and sandwich were ready seperately. My sandwich was wrapped in a foil bag & tossed on the counter with no word of thanks or even a smile. The staff were more interested in talking to each other than creating a friendly atmosphere. I had high hopes looking at your menu. I was willing to let the very worn floors & poor seating options slide for a good sandwich. Its just a sandwich after all.  Even Subway makes a better sandwich for less money. Have you seen a sandwich from The Red Barn? Step it up Rise and Grind! Take  look at what your competitors are doing.
I will not be back. Poor recommendation from me."
Rise & Grind,Coffee & Tea,"1294 Broad Street Victoria, BC V8W 2A5 Canada",BC,48.426279,-123.366511,5,"Finally after 2 years living downtown I have found a coffee shop that is absolutely wonderful. They have excellent breakfast, amazing/healthy lunch options and more. The staff are nice and welcoming, and not snobby or pretentious like many of the other coffee/breakfast spots downtown Victoria. Excellent location too!! Look forward to coming to Rise and Grind (almost) every morning. Thank you for your great cafe and service!!"

I recommend."

I was starving and totally forgot to snap a pic! 🤣 But hey, it was absolutely delicious, no complaints there. The restaurant had such a cool vibe, and my kids had a blast posing with all the animal decorations for pictures."
The Ruby,Breakfast & Brunch,"642 Johnson St Victoria, BC V8W 1M6 Canada",BC,48.4275172,-123.3656961,5,"What a great spot for some breakfast! Welcoming staff, cozy atmosphere, great coffee and cappuccino, staff go above and beyond to accommodate customizations and time accommodations. All their shredded hash breakfasts are absolutely delicious and packed with nutrition, I personally ask for well done hash so it’s nice and sharp when they flip it over."
The Ruby,Breakfast & Brunch,"642 Johnson St Victoria, BC V8W 1M6 Canada",BC,48.4275172,-123.3656961,3,"Came in for breakfast with a group of 11 and kids, we requested separate tables as we were going to pay separately, but they offered 1 big table together as they were quite empty. First issue, kids were not prioritized even though we mentioned that they were hungry and adult can wait. Server only took drinks order then prioritized smaller table to get their meal order as it will take short time to do so compared to our table regardless they were seated after us. Last thing was they added gratuity to our bill without prior information which left us no choice but to pay. That's was the main reason we wanted separate table and being charge for service that we considered not there.
Other than those issues that left us disappointed, food taste was incredible, freshly prepared ingredients with jam, sauce,everything taste amazing. Worth to visit for food only."
The Ruby,Breakfast & Brunch,"642 Johnson St Victoria, BC V8W 1M6 Canada",BC,48.4275172,-123.3656961,5,You definitely gotta try this out!! We knew this diner has a special history which I can tell why locals keep coming back. Mesmerizing decor and menu is extensive; it was hard to decide where to sit and what to order. We tried their delicious breakfast menu. Generous portion and we were so full that we needed to walk it out. The staff was humble and all their recommendations were spot on. Must try !!
The Ruby,Breakfast & Brunch,"642 Johnson St Victoria, BC V8W 1M6 Canada",BC,48.4275172,-123.3656961,5,"This just may have been the best breakfast I've ever ordered at a restaurant. We ordered the berry waffles and the poutine benny and my oh my were they delicious. The contrast between the sweet and savory meals was delightful (my wife and I shared our meals). The waffles were honestly the best waffles I have ever eaten. Each bite nearly brought a tear to my eye from being so tasty. The only complaint is that I live about 1000 miles away from The Ruby 😞. This restaurant alone tempts me to uproot my family and move to Victoria just to eat breakfast here every week.

A side note, we were with our 17 month old baby and the staff was sooo kind and accommodating with him."

I think I have found a new breakfast favourite when in Victoria! A must try is the lavender latte! So many delicious dishes to choose from.

You must be patient if you want to come here, can take 30-40 min wait. But it has a nice sitting area. Good food though, was worth the wait."

Didn't have to wait too long for a table. Service was top notch, friendly, and prompt. I'm a Waffle 🧇/ Pancake 🥞 girl and The Ruby did not disappoint me. Caramelized bananas 🍌, roasted pecans and bourbon syrup, on top of a stack of mouth watering waffles 🧇. Hubby had an omelet with bacon 🥓, mushrooms 🍄, and cheese 🧀.
Thank you Ruby!!!! ✌️"

The potatoes are the perfect crispy fluffy ratio. The duck just fell off the bone & the sauce that same with it paired perfectly well. Would definitely go back & recommended. Only downside is that it's small so not lots of seating, but still worth a visit. The staff were also helpful & friendly :)"
Wah Lai Yuen,Chinese,"560 Fisgard Street Victoria, BC V8W 1R4 Canada",BC,48.4295034,-123.3675693,5,Amazing char sui and rice! Got a large portion for about $20 😀 The red bean bun and egg tart were also amazing!!! It’s hard to find good Chinese bbq and buns in Victoria so this is really appreciated. Staff were very kind too. Can’t wait to come back and try the crispy pork.
Wah Lai Yuen,Chinese,"560 Fisgard Street Victoria, BC V8W 1R4 Canada",BC,48.4295034,-123.3675693,5,"Amazing place to enjoy Chinese food.
Bbq pork with wanton noodles soup is awesome. Kids love it, too.
Food server Kevin is very helpful in suggesting what dish is a must for our first time."
Wah Lai Yuen,Chinese,"560 Fisgard Street Victoria, BC V8W 1R4 Canada",BC,48.4295034,-123.3675693,1,Some of the worst Asian food I have ever eaten.  Duck was mostly bones and had little taste. Beef flank Lo Mein had tasteless fatty meat with some corn starch sauce that also had an off taste.  Worst was the noodles which were not Lo mein but Singapore thin noodles that I have never seen offered in this dish. Service was pretty rude.  Don't bother with this nasty place.
Wah Lai Yuen,Chinese,"560 Fisgard Street Victoria, BC V8W 1R4 Canada",BC,48.4295034,-123.3675693,5,"Awesome experience! Delicious sweet and sour pork, tasty rice and good spicy soup. We’ll definitely return here💙"
Wah Lai Yuen,Chinese,"560 Fisgard Street Victoria, BC V8W 1R4 Canada",BC,48.4295034,-123.3675693,5,Great spot for authentic Hong Kong/Cantonese cuisine in Victoria. This place along with Don Mee (Dim Sum) are my two favorite restaurants in Victoria. They also have bakery and BBQ meat offering too. The food quality is top notch and the taste is just as good as the best from the mainland. Definitely the top 3 best Chinese restaurants on the Island.
JBI Café Restaurant,Cafes,"270 Government Street Victoria, BC V8V 2L2 Canada",BC,48.4153947,-123.3694605,5,"This is the second time I've stayed here. I love it, the rooms are small and still use the old style hot water heating radiator so if it's cold in there it will take a bit to heat up. There is no AC so I'd expect it can get hot in the summer. The hotel has a colourful history and is over 100 years old. The hallways are adorned with Emily Carr Paintings (she died there) also the hotel supposedly is one of the most haunted in Canada although I haven't experienced anything while there.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. If you're into older style hotels that aren't just another boring place then this place is for you."
JBI Café Restaurant,Cafes,"270 Government Street Victoria, BC V8V 2L2 Canada",BC,48.4153947,-123.3694605,5,"This is one of my favorite spots for dinner when in town.  I’ve tried almost everything on the menu and have yet to find something I didn’t enjoy.

In addition to the regular menu, they have specials each evening, which typically include a pasta and a main entree.  These can sell out quickly on busy nights.

The Caesar salad is amazing and I always get one!

There are several vegetarian options and the veggie burger is great.

Bar options are limited in the restaurant but you can enjoy beer or wine with your meal.

Service is always friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is cozy."
JBI Café Restaurant,Cafes,"270 Government Street Victoria, BC V8V 2L2 Canada",BC,48.4153947,-123.3694605,4,"Overall good!  Food was good proportions generous,  tasted pretty good although my steak sandwich could use more seasoning and less cooking.  Service was excellent, atmosphere was excellent both restaurant and pub, prices very reasonable. Would like to try again."
JBI Café Restaurant,Cafes,"270 Government Street Victoria, BC V8V 2L2 Canada",BC,48.4153947,-123.3694605,5,Nice old place in the heart of James bay 10 min walk from down town no line up big and roomy  ordered a full candaron breakfast first bite amazing. Tastes like home made bread  vary happy with the size of the breakfast. The service is good. If you like a place for breakfast without a line up  this is your place parking is easy too
JBI Café Restaurant,Cafes,"270 Government Street Victoria, BC V8V 2L2 Canada",BC,48.4153947,-123.3694605,5,"Can't say enough great things about this hotel! Immaculately clean. Roy at the desk was a gem. Dinner in the bar was great with friendly conversation, and they accommodated us when we said we needed our breakfast to be quick. Great location to visit the stunning Beacon Hill Park. Rooms are small, but that's to be expected for an historic hotel like this. Highly recommend!"
The Sticky Wicket,British,"The Strathcona Hotel 919 Douglas Street Victoria, BC V8W 2C2 Canada",BC,48.4234682,-123.3654445,4,"Old world charm meats big screen TV's.
Nice selection of both import and local brewery beer. I went with the wicket lager, it's brewed by Vancouver island brewery.
Menu is not overwhelming and it's easy to find something you want to try. Whether it be bangers and Mash, a burger or even mac and cheese.
The food is seasoned well and decent portions.
Staff were all welcoming and friendly.  We did find that one gentleman who brought the food to the table wore entirely too much cologne. It was to the point I would sneeze every time he walked past us.
Perhaps businesses need to bring back the no scent atmosphere for their customers convenience.
We will return.
Import beer is pricey"
The Sticky Wicket,British,"The Strathcona Hotel 919 Douglas Street Victoria, BC V8W 2C2 Canada",BC,48.4234682,-123.3654445,4,"Steak was well cooked with delicious herb butter on top. Brussel sprouts were way undercooked, mashed potatoes were really salty. Mac and cheese is incredible, though - you can add chicken, broccoli, etc for an extra charge. Our server was nice, but only visited the tables on each side of us (not ours) in the last 20 minutes, so it took a long time to get our check. We never got a refill on water either, but maybe they figured the bottle of wine was adequate for us 😉 Be aware that there's a game room with pool etc, sports games on TV, so it can get a little loud if you're seated near it. Main dining room is relatively quiet otherwise, or it was when we went. Basically the food is good, service is alright, and they have a rooftop patio that looks great. The food was good enough that I'd give it another chance when I'm in town. It wasn't particularly busy, but maybe our server had more tables in another room that kept her busier than we were aware of?"
The Sticky Wicket,British,"The Strathcona Hotel 919 Douglas Street Victoria, BC V8W 2C2 Canada",BC,48.4234682,-123.3654445,4,"Hanna was great! Sat in the actual sticky wicket (not the rooftop which has a cover, and no view, or the games room which seems to be more about watching sports). This is a confusing place. There are multiple bars and all of them have different taps and features but they kind of represent as one establishment except they aren't. Many of the menu items like the seafood boil for instance are only 2 days a month and only on the rooftop. I'm not sure if it's intentional deception or just bad marketing. Staff was friendly, service was good. Just a little confusing and frustrating. Nice margaritas and palmeos with Tajin rims (Mexican chilli lime salt). Beer selection is to limited as far as I'm concerned, no hazy or imperial IPA or sours."
The Sticky Wicket,British,"The Strathcona Hotel 919 Douglas Street Victoria, BC V8W 2C2 Canada",BC,48.4234682,-123.3654445,4,"Wish there were more vegetarian/vegan options, but for a traditional pub it was great! I had the Baha bowl with tofu and it was great. My friend had the bangers and mash and said it was ok."
The Sticky Wicket,British,"The Strathcona Hotel 919 Douglas Street Victoria, BC V8W 2C2 Canada",BC,48.4234682,-123.3654445,4,"Great food and service.

La Belle Patate,Fast Food,"1215 Davie Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1N4 Canada",BC,49.2820333,-123.1335487,5,"Absolutely legendary. Fries were still crisp under the copious amount of gravy. Lots of squeaky cheese curds. Great smoked meat sandwich too. Service was a little whatever when we went though, maybe funner at night"
La Belle Patate,Fast Food,"1215 Davie Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1N4 Canada",BC,49.2820333,-123.1335487,4,"I recently visited La Belle Patate and tried their BBQ Poutine, it was absolutely delicious! The combination of crispy fries, savory gravy, and flavorful BBQ sauce was just perfect. I loved every bite of it!

Apart from the food, the interior decor of the restaurant was also very unique and eye-catching. It gave off a cozy and welcoming vibe, making me feel right at home. I especially loved the wall art and the cozy seating arrangements.

Overall, I would highly recommend La Belle Patate to anyone who loves great food and a cozy ambiance. It's definitely a must-visit spot in town! I'm already planning to come back and try some of their other menu items, and I can't wait to see what other surprises they have in store."

So glad I did, the laidback atmosphere as if you were at home. A small place packed with a friendly and relaxed attitude, but most of all poutine! I got a medium-sized traditional poutine and it was just so incredibly good. Not greasy, not too salty, just perfect! Paired with a light beer, couldn’t ask for more."
La Belle Patate,Fast Food,"1215 Davie Street Vancouver, BC V6E 1N4 Canada",BC,49.2820333,-123.1335487,5,I love this place so much!

La Belle Patate,Fast Food,"1215 Esquimalt Road Victoria, BC V9A 3P1 Canada",BC,48.4300048,-123.4132095,5,"A must for visitors (like us from Colorado) and locals alike. If you want delicious, authentic poutine look no further. Plus, the service was immaculate and the owner is so so friendly ! Definitely try the spruce beer (non-alcoholic, think ginger beer or root beer), and you won’t be disappointed. The poutine is the best and the steamie is a perfect little hot dog with all the toppings. Don’t miss this awesome place !"

Having seen La Bella Patate recommended countless times, it lived up to the hype completely. The staff were quite friendly, creating a relaxed atmosphere, and the food was great. I ordered a small classic poutine and a spruce beer (if you're on the fence, try the beer) and look forward to returning in order to try a hotdog next.

Overall this is a very fairly priced and tasty gem in Esquimalt. Solid 10/10."

Superior Pizza,Pizza,"455 Simcoe Street Victoria, BC V8V 4T3 Canada",BC,48.4155363,-123.3748544,2,"I've had ok pizza from here, and the staff are generally decent. Their thin crust is not good but regular crust is maybe a 6. We order from them sometimes because they are local and close.

I ordered delivery from them a week ago, and everything was delivered cold.

The worst part is that i tried something new, their cheese stuffed bread. The description:

""Fresh baked bread stuffed with garlic butter, villages mozzarella edam blend & cheddar cheese. Topped with parmesan cheese.""

The reality:

It was cold, burnt, and inedible and after taking the picture it went directly in the garbage. Unfortunately no email address for customer service.

Very disappointed and on this basis alone, quite unlikely to order from them again."

The crust was thick and chewy, the cheese was barely melted, there was very little sauce. The mini brownies came in a Village's Pizza paper bag. If it's been taken over by Village's , it explains the downturn in quality. Time to find a new pizza place!"

Dinner server Michael left an impression nobody can ever live up to, what a service, such a caring gentlemen, treating diners like royalty. If not just for food, I’d come back just to be served by Michael again. Salmon and squid for dinner with a guava passion fruit juice was a very memorable combo, I’d have it again. Breakfast is great too, but service is just normal. Potato Green Apple soup with olive oil was the bomb for breakfast! The Artichoke Spinnach benny on their biscuit was really good, I packed one home too and it stays fresh and soft for long time. Wow wow wow! Great vegetarian and pescatarian options!"

Vista 18,Wine Bars,"740 Burdett Avenue 18th Floor Victoria, BC V8W 1B2 Canada",BC,48.4221151,-123.3646121,5,I love this place. It's unique because it's on the 18th floor and also I think it's a real treat. The drinks are incredible and so is the food. Staff are always so friendly and attentive.
Avalon Restaurant,Breakfast & Brunch,"1075 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8V 3K5 Canada",BC,48.4233708,-123.3548685,4,Randomly tried this spot on the weekend and the food was fantastic. All five in our group thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The pancakes were fluffy the fruit was fresh and service friendly. It took a little while for our food to come out but it was worth the wait. I would definitely recommend coming here for brunch and will be back! The prices are also very reasonable.

Eggs Benny were delicious, pancakes light and fluffy and the skillet was incredibly tasty!! Did I mention the potatoes!?? They have got to be the best and most delicious potatoes ever!! Crispy outside, soft and tender inside, perfectly seasoned!!! Amazing they are all homemade! 10 stars!! Server was super attentive and kind! And great for Pokemonners since there's a stop out front and we made a new friend from the restaurant!"
Avalon Restaurant,Breakfast & Brunch,"1075 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8V 3K5 Canada",BC,48.4233708,-123.3548685,5,"My new favourite breakfast place. It’s a small greasy-spoon style diner, run by a family. The portions are large, the staff are amazingly friendly and the coffee is refillable. It was very busy the day we went and the staff/family was obviously struggling to keep up, but you could tell they were trying their best and everyone waited patiently. All around this place is amazing and I will go back many times."

So IMPRESSED! Courteous service and astounding food. Wild Salmon & Avocado Benedict on the homemade bread was delicious!"
Avalon Restaurant,Breakfast & Brunch,"1075 Fort Street Victoria, BC V8V 3K5 Canada",BC,48.4233708,-123.3548685,5,"Decided to try this place out because my friend and I didn’t feel like waiting in line somewhere else. I’m so glad we came here instead, the food was perfect and the prices were amazing compared to some of the other brunch places in town! I had the smoked salmon and avocado benny and it was delicious. The potatoes were super crispy and their homemade bread was so good, as well as their homemade hot sauce! Service was awesome as well, and the atmosphere was very cozy and homey in the best way. Found my new favourite brunch spot!"
The Tartan Toque,Canadian (New),"1507 Pandora Avenue Victoria, BC V8R 6P9 Canada",BC,48.42598,-123.339,5,Great wings and a decent price! They have some really delicious and interesting sauce options (highly recommend the creamy dill!! tossed with actual little pieces of pickle). The fries are also amazing. The house salad is also a great value for how much you get and is awesome to cut through the grease a bit with some veg.
The Tartan Toque,Canadian (New),"1507 Pandora Avenue Victoria, BC V8R 6P9 Canada",BC,48.42598,-123.339,2,"Unfortunately FartnPuke has gone way downhill since I used to frequent in 2015 and 2016 area. Recently coming back several times in the past two years. Always fairly underwhelming.
Last time I came here it seemed to be a
very high bill for a hotdog combo with 2 beers. ($40 or $50?)

I came today to get the garlic fries. Came to 11.60 altogether and they were very underwhelming. Charging an extra 3$ for no real sauce or flavour really is a new thing to add."
The Tartan Toque,Canadian (New),"1507 Pandora Avenue Victoria, BC V8R 6P9 Canada",BC,48.42598,-123.339,5,"I'm 100% not a review person but as a gluten free vegan I have to post here to praise the vibe that is this restaurant. Perfect dive bar feelings with gluten free vegan wings and almost 20 vegan flavour/sauce options. Ask for the vegan tahini sauce for dipping your veggies and ""wings"". Brilliant. Hidden gem in the city for the best option for a night out with multiple people and lots of options. I've never been so full of and stoked on tofu."
The Tartan Toque,Canadian (New),"1507 Pandora Avenue Victoria, BC V8R 6P9 Canada",BC,48.42598,-123.339,1,"Food was so so expensive, literally 2 dollars per wing in a 1/2lb order. Not worth it. Burgers were 12 bucks, and tiny for that price. Things tasted fine but not good enough to charge an arm and leg. The server was kind, the atmosphere seemed fine, but the prices were 3 dollars more than only a couple years ago. That's ridiculous even given the pandemic, and I won't be going back."
The Tartan Toque,Canadian (New),"1507 Pandora Avenue Victoria, BC V8R 6P9 Canada",BC,48.42598,-123.339,5,"I have NEVER had a better smash burger or fries in Victoria. NEVER! Staff is fantastic, food and tunes were great along with a solid place! Need to go back and smash some of the best wings in Victoria a few years running now, but the burger already has my vote 🖤"

- so good! soft n tender, mushroom sauce and cabbage was right on the point 10/10!
2. lobster bisque

3. french fries
- hot and crispy just perfecto

in general: very good service, there was a bit of waiting for the food but that’s fine, dinners good!

Vis-à-Vis,Wine Bars,"2232 Oak Bay Avenue Victoria, BC V8R 1G5 Canada",BC,48.4266254,-123.3149281,4,Very nice patio and two different menus options ( you can also order from The Penny Farthing menu). I only don’t give them a 5 star review because the menu doesn’t specify what the gluten free options or any other dietary options are. The service was good and they are pet friendly at the patio. I had a gluten free Brie pear prosciutto chicken burger. It was good but later on I realized that I could have opted for lettuce wrap and my server didn’t even mentioned anything. Anyway we enjoy our food and will definitely come back. 😊
Vis-à-Vis,Wine Bars,"2232 Oak Bay Avenue Victoria, BC V8R 1G5 Canada",BC,48.4266254,-123.3149281,5,First time dining here this weekend and was very pleasantly surprised it lived up to the hype! Best french onion soup I've ever had and escargot was fantastic. Will definitely be back!
Vis-à-Vis,Wine Bars,"2232 Oak Bay Avenue Victoria, BC V8R 1G5 Canada",BC,48.4266254,-123.3149281,1,"Worse restaurant food ever. Very lukewarm service.  Pictures say a thousand words. The carrots were charred black and inedible, the duck leg was black and there’s a rat, named Remi, that makes better Ratatouille.  Believe it or not, we had to pay for this.  Very, very sad that we didn’t go to our favourite, Brasserie l’ecole."
Ebizo Japanese Restaurant,Japanese,"604 Broughton Street Victoria, BC V8W 1C7 Canada",BC,48.4242474,-123.3675773,5,"Favourite sushi bar in Victoria. Great location to walk to if you’re downtown, near great shops off government street. Service is always excellent. The atmosphere is quiet and a great layout, not a huge place so at peak times you may have to wait for a table. I’ve purchased takeout as well and quality is still superior to other sushi takeout. A favourite place of mine for lunch. The food is top notch, always peak freshness, excellent presentation as well."
Ebizo Japanese Restaurant,Japanese,"604 Broughton Street Victoria, BC V8W 1C7 Canada",BC,48.4242474,-123.3675773,5,"Make a reservation, because the fact that our reserved group of 6 (the max they'll reserve for) went on a Tuesday evening and the place was just packed, says it all. Really good food; really good service. If you love sushi, do not miss this opportunity. And if you have celiac disease, just ask for gluten-free options and they'll have you covered. I went there with my gluten-free Meetup and it was excellent. Reasonable prices too, considering the times we live in. A great date-night idea in the heart of downtown."
Ebizo Japanese Restaurant,Japanese,"604 Broughton Street Victoria, BC V8W 1C7 Canada",BC,48.4242474,-123.3675773,5,"I have eaten at many sushi restaurants and this one definitely places among the very best. The fish was so fresh with a buttery texture, the green tea refreshing and well-presented, the service was excellent and the prices were good. If I lived here I would eat here at least once per week. Highly recommended!"
Ebizo Japanese Restaurant,Japanese,"604 Broughton Street Victoria, BC V8W 1C7 Canada",BC,48.4242474,-123.3675773,5,"We had an excellent experience, with friendly staff, great food and honest prices."
Ebizo Japanese Restaurant,Japanese,"604 Broughton Street Victoria, BC V8W 1C7 Canada",BC,48.4242474,-123.3675773,3,"My work colleague rants and raves of this place all the time and had been bugging me to go all these months. I finally did somewhat reluctantly; I had a one-time unpleasant experience eating here with my dad when I was 16 (my older daughter is currently this age just to give you a time stamp) and had bad diarrhea afterwards, nearly missing my first Young Drivers appointment back in the day. 🙅🏻‍♀️

Food quality is okay. The sashimi is fresh but not that huge deal that it melts in your mouth and you must go here now that I read in other reviews. 🤔 As you can see, the presentation for their large assorted sashimi is very lacking; 15 pieces yes, but of very limited type and for the price? Not a good value to the eye of a sashimi connoisseur. My beef teriyaki was overcooked. They asked how I liked it done, I replied medium rare, but dish was medium borderline well done.

Service was there but quite slow; we were given the bill but took a very, very long time for them to come back for the POS. I mean, why bring the bill if you're not ready to accept payment right then and there, and made to wait? 🤷🏻‍♀️

No stomach upset this visit which is a plus but even ordering their two biggest entrees, I left the place hungry still and underwhelmed. I feel this place is overhyped, would only go back here with accompaniment, and would most likely order something completely else on the menu. 🙎🏻‍♀️"
Hot and Cold Cafe,Soup,"313 Cook Street Victoria, BC V8V Canada",BC,48.4144169,-123.3561763,5,"I’ve been here three times for the chicken soup with rice. I really enjoy it and its a great portion for the price.

Cute cafe and it’s a nice vibe for cozy."
Hot and Cold Cafe,Soup,"313 Cook Street Victoria, BC V8V Canada",BC,48.4144169,-123.3561763,5,"This is the perfect stop for a quick bite while you’re out running errands or doing homework. I tried the chicken pozole and a slice of the banana bread. The soup was absolutely amazing! I got a cup of the soup and you have an option for a side of bread or rice. I tried the bread and it was so fresh and went great with the soup. The banana bread wasn’t the best, it was a little tough to bite into, but I did order it in the afternoon. The cafe itself has only a few tables for mostly groups or two, but many seemed to be available when I went. Will definitely be stopping by again!"
Hot and Cold Cafe,Soup,"313 Cook Street Victoria, BC V8V Canada",BC,48.4144169,-123.3561763,5,"We weren’t sure if this is where we wanted to stop for lunch, but we were glad we did! The staff was very helpful and enthusiastic about our menu choices, and gave us a good timeframe for when we’d get our food.

The curried egg sandwich was fresh and light, made with their house-made bread. The salad was also really nice and very tasty. Glad we stopped in for a bite!"
Hot and Cold Cafe,Soup,"313 Cook Street Victoria, BC V8V Canada",BC,48.4144169,-123.3561763,5,"It took me way too long to try some of the sandwiches here, but now I cannot be stopped. The Creamy Almond Veggie and Sweet Chili Chicken sandwiches are so fresh and delicious, it's everything you can ask for in a sandwich. The soup and salads look very yummy as well, so can't wait to try them. You will find me on the outside street patio with my dog on too many days of the week. Watch out around this time of year, the beautiful tree out front, will pelt you in the head with it's little spiky green acorn thingys."
Hot and Cold Cafe,Soup,"313 Cook Street Victoria, BC V8V Canada",BC,48.4144169,-123.3561763,5,"I come here 2+ times a week.  All the food is good, I have yet to find something I don't like.  The two regular menu soups (Chicken and a curry one) are fantastic, have them with the rice for a very filling meal.  Staff is always friendly."
Baan Thai Restaurant,Thai,"1117 Blanshard St Victoria, BC V8W 2H7 Canada",BC,48.4247323,-123.3621701,5,"Excellent meal at Baan Thai.  Service was great and food came out quickly.  The Tom Yum soup was rich and delicious.  The Papaya salad was surprisingly spicy, in a good way.  The drunken rice and Panang Curry were both so flavorful.  I prefer Pad Thai elsewhere, but with so many great choices here, it's hard to go wrong. The key lime pie was amazing!"
Baan Thai Restaurant,Thai,"1117 Blanshard St Victoria, BC V8W 2H7 Canada",BC,48.4247323,-123.3621701,4,Nice restaurant! Great ambience and friendly staff. The food was great as well. We will visit again when next we are in town.
Baan Thai Restaurant,Thai,"1117 Blanshard St Victoria, BC V8W 2H7 Canada",BC,48.4247323,-123.3621701,5,"We had a delicious meal with another couple. Four of us enjoyed: spring rolls, Tom Yum soup (YUM!), papaya salad (YUM!), chicken satay, calamari (not very Thai, but someone wanted it, was good), for appetizers. For our mains we ordered Pad seeuw, Thai Garden, Macua phad Tofu, we also ordered a chicken dish, which I did not eat as I mostly eat plant based/vegan. We ordered the food mild, and it was very mild, but with many herbs and spices - it was flavourful. We all agreed it was delicious. We thought the food prices were reasonable. It's a new favourite restaurant!"
Baan Thai Restaurant,Thai,"1117 Blanshard St Victoria, BC V8W 2H7 Canada",BC,48.4247323,-123.3621701,4,My drunken noodles were pretty good.  Husband didn't like his food at all. The atmosphere was nice.

Our server (gosh I'm terrible with names) was super sweet and really went above and beyond for us. My friend and I had never been in canada and asked about the currency and she gave us a full tour of it all. Canada, I do not mean to mock your currency, it is beautiful, but I really thought she was kidding when she told us about loonies and toonies. Delicious and educational lunch"

The place has a fairly cozy atmosphere and fair portion sizes, hands down the papaya salad was the best thing we had. It's been ages since we've had a good papaya salad with a proper spice to it. Martini was a touch bit on the strong side and don't bother with the coffee if you're looking for a caffeine slap. Overall will definitely be returning next time I'm in town!"

In Oak Bay, there's a place to dine,
Where cuisine is spectacular and so divine.

Baan Thai, you'll come to know,
As a flavoured journey that'll make you glow.

From savory curries to spicy soups,
Each dish is crafted with exotic roots.

With flavors that dance upon your tongue,
And aromas that leave you forever sprung.

Sizzling Tandoor,Indian,"637 Johnson Street Victoria, BC V8W 1M7 Canada",BC,48.427039,-123.3656218,5,"Tasty food and wonderful service. My son, who’s a picky eater, said that If there are more than 5 stars then he would give that to this place! We ordered coconut curry, Mango curry and butter chicken. All three of them are yummy and the latter is the best!"

Also, special mention for the hostess/server who was very accommodating with all our requests, kind, friendly and also suggested few good spots to check out in Victoria!

PS: went back the next day to get some take out. Lovely Indian food in Victoria that I hope everyone checks out if they’re craving some!"
Sizzling Tandoor,Indian,"637 Johnson Street Victoria, BC V8W 1M7 Canada",BC,48.427039,-123.3656218,5,This was the only place that was open and not busy on Family Day and I'm glad we chanced upon it. This place was wonderful and the food was delicious! I got the chicken tikka curry and my husband got the kharri curry. It was perfect for a cold February day. We will be back again.

Sizzling Tandoor,Indian,"637 Johnson Street Victoria, BC V8W 1M7 Canada",BC,48.427039,-123.3656218,5,"This has become destination dining for us when visiting Victoria, for a number of reasons. The food is packed with flavor and consistently excellent, whether you take it mild or spicy. The drinks are inventive and delicious, and the bartender—who I believe either owns or co-owns the restaurant—improvised an off-the-menu version of a Manhattan for my wife that was as tasty as it was potent. Finally, the staff are attentive and welcoming, warm and knowledgeable. A hidden gem. Well worth a try, if you’re ever even remotely in the mood for Indian cuisine."

I would come back again."
Cafe Mexico,Mexican,"1425 Store Street Victoria, BC V8W 3C6 Canada",BC,48.4280603,-123.3688021,5,Great authentic Mexican cuisine. And the staff are really friendly. I got into a long conversation with the manager about how they make pulled pork. He even shared the recipe so I could try to replicate it at home -- and recommended a pretty fantastic cookbook. A great place.

We took the only available seating on the outside for lunch. What a find!

The food and service were superb. The lobster roll was perfection. The fish and chips was also nicely done with a healthy portion of fish.

We all highly recommend and agreed ""You Gotta Eat Here""."
Water Prince Corner Shop,Seafood,"141 Water Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1A8 Canada",PEI,46.2339164,-63.1222245,5,"Best lobster roll on the island (so far). Even saying that, it’s going to be hard to find better. Great family restaurant vibe. Friendly and helpful staff. Very clean. No wait time, although we came after peak lunch time.
The seafood chowder was very good. My wife got the chicken burger and it was also very good.
Left it up to the waitress for a local beer and she definitely didn’t steer me wrong. 100% would come back!"
Water Prince Corner Shop,Seafood,"141 Water Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1A8 Canada",PEI,46.2339164,-63.1222245,5,"Excellent local restaurant.  The best lobster roll I had during my stay.  Also ordered the fish cakes and onion rings.  Reasonably priced; about $75 including tax.

Ordered seafood to take home with me.  Great service.  They make it super easy to order and pack it well for travel.  Better product and cheaper than buying it at home.

Would definitely recommend as one of the restaurants to check out in Charlottetown.  Love that they have long hours."
Water Prince Corner Shop,Seafood,"141 Water Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1A8 Canada",PEI,46.2339164,-63.1222245,5,"Great place! The scallop burger and the lobster roll were so good. The scallop was slightly fried to perfection and the lobster was tender, slightly chewy, and fresh. I really like the buns of the lobster roll because it was toasted on the outside and very crispy. Compared to the other lobster rolls, this was the best. The oysters were very fresh and goes amazingly well with the sauce. Highly recommend and would come again 🦞"
Water Prince Corner Shop,Seafood,"141 Water Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1A8 Canada",PEI,46.2339164,-63.1222245,5,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, WELL WORTH THE WAIT! We came back the next day instead of trying out other restaurants.
We ordered mussels, clams, oysters, seafood chowder, lobster roll, and halibut fish and chips (during the 2 visits). Food was beyond great!!! Both times, it did not disappoint! We're not a fan of oysters, we just wanted to try it again and the oysters were great too!
We did, eventually, try another restaurant's mussels but this place has the best mussels/food.
Extremely friendly staff!
When we came back, it was very busy.. we did have to wait long but it was well worth the wait!
Make a reservation or come in between meal hours for a better chance of getting a table. When we come back to Cahrlottetown, this will be one of the places we will definitely come back to!"
Claddagh Oyster House,Seafood,"131 Sydney Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1G5 Canada",PEI,46.233763,-63.126065,3,"I was very excited to eat here as I read that it was one of (if not the best) seafood restaurants in Halifax. It was underwhelming.

I ordered the oysters Rockefeller, which was probably my own fault for ordering. It was just cheese on a shell.

The halibut special was good, although the strawberry purée they served it with clashed a little. The potatoes were only okay.

I enjoyed the mussels that my friend got, some of the best I’ve had!

All in all, it is a good restaurant, the service is alright, and the food is pretty good. I would say it’s not worth the price though. I was tempted to give 4 stars, but at these price points, it’s a 3."

I had lobster risotto and my partner had seafood pasta, both were good. Not raving about either dish, but we weren’t disappointed either.
Small place inside so recommend reservations!"

However, onion rings tasted very oily.  Yuck.

The dumplings were really good.

The chicken burger was good except it tasted very salty.  Did someone just dump salt onto it?

Lastly, the refills which came much later.  My cola tasted like moldy.   Not sure if it was ice cubes, glass or the actual cola.

The pictures online show well but food was substandard.

I really apologize for leaving this review but I was struggling with my meal.

Good luck to your business.  Zero tip."

They change their menu each month which we think is super cool and as a family with a million allergies (celiac, seafood, nuts, dairy, soy, etc) we were delighted by the precautions taken and assurance that we were in the right hands.
I love my family, but we tend to be very stuck-up when it comes to trying new restaurants as we have high expectations this restaurant blew us out of the water!
We cannot wait to come back and are even more excited to try a whole new menu!
Trying this is a must, whether you just want a drink or are looking for a delectable meal the Hopyard is the place to be!"

With an ever evolving menu, options for vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free, and amble beer selection you'll have to visit more than once to experience everything you would want to try here! 14/10 would recommend you go here now!"
Hopyard,Beer Bar,"151 Kent Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1N5 Canada",PEI,46.2365678,-63.1276157,3,"We had great service, and it was a nice environment. My only complaint was that the food we ordered was coated in so many different rich sauces and it was very salty. Having a sensitive tummy sometimes, all the sauce/salt made the food hard to eat - if I had known I would have requested lessss sauce. But I can see how people love this place."
Hopyard,Beer Bar,"151 Kent Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1N5 Canada",PEI,46.2365678,-63.1276157,5,"Stumbled in here mostly by accident while looking for vegan food, we were both delightfully surprised by the menu; tons of great veggie options. My partner loved the vegan tacos, and the poke bowl was AMAZING. Lots of cool brews on tap; my light ale tasted more like a hoppy IPA, but… I am not a beer expert! Overall highly recommend, great spot."

Didn’t try any food but the menu looks like it’s worth checking out next visit. Very clean. Friendly staff. Interesting architecture."

Delicious fish cakes, tuna tartare and fish tacos. Our waitress was great and the service was excellent!

Highly recommend!"

Place was hopping and had I known we were going to be moved like cattle, I would have foregone the oysters. My husband wound up eating them after the entre . Delicious fish tacos and fish and chips!! Service was friendly and personable. Next time I won’t order the meals til we get the drinks and apps."

Our group had Fish Cakes, Seafood Chowder, and the Ring Bearer Burger. The burger was a huge disappointment as the beef patty came burned.  We were puzzled that such badly cooked item could come from the same kitchen that has produced amazing food in past visits, and the great fish cakes & chowder.  Not to repeat anytime soon despite the great beer."
The Brickhouse Kitchen & Bar,Seafood,"125 Sydney Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4K4 Canada",PEI,46.2336031,-63.1262273,5,"A great place to stop in for brunch with friends! This historic building is very quirky and modernized inside, with beautiful artwork displayed on the walls and nice dim lighting. Huge, well-stocked bar upstairs with a large variety of spirits to cater to all your cocktail needs.

The plating was a bit messy, but don't let that off-put you - the food was delicious and the dishes were quite large, everything was very filling. A bit on the pricier side overall, but worth it for a treat."

The Pilot House,Seafood,"70 Grafton St Charlottetown, PE C1A 1K7 Canada",PEI,46.2337815,-63.1285997,5,"Great outdoor patio and great food. Had the chicken burger, fries, flat bread pizza and garden salad.
Flatbread pizza and the garden salad were plain. And I did not like the homemade salad dressing. However their homemade ranch is amazing. I highly recommend getting a side of ranch for your fries.
Chicken burger was a 10/10"

In a rush to watch Anne & Gilbert in a little more than 1.5hrs. We ordered take out but then the manager (sorry, forgot your name) said a table opened up and if we chose, could sit and experience the restaurant instead. We chose to stay and found out it was the right move. From the beginning, the two greeters were amazing -helpful and friendly. Also our server who recommended the No Boats On Sunday Cranberry Cidar, Maddy. Atmosphere was lively and the food was great. Only thing better was the service and kindness by the staff.

We've had meals in Montreal, Quebec City, Halifax, Peggy's Cove, Lunenburg, Digby, St. John and Saint Andrews by-the-sea.

Never missing a beat and very good hospitality. The food was well served and prepared. I recommend the seafood chowder - wonderful flavor. And if you order biscuits, it comes with a sweet butter that is so delicious. The building is well designed in atmosphere, love the old chandelier."
Sims Corner Steakhouse & Oyster Bar,Steakhouses,"86 Queen Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4A7 Canada",PEI,46.233264,-63.12622,4,"It’s a pretty dark restaurant. The furniture are heavy looking with all velvet chairs or velvet couches. Very mixed colors from bright pink to dark green chairs; not sure how my eyes felt. But I was comfortably sitting though. The service of our waitress was super slow but she was super nice. Example, it took her 20 minutes to bring us two bottles of wine. So you can imagine how long it took to take our orders and to receive our plates. I ordered seared Halibut with roasted vegetables. And green salad with candied walnuts, beet chips, goat cheese and raspberry vinaigrette. The salad was mind blowing. My halibut was good till you reach in the middle where flavor hasn’t penetrated inside, so it was very bland inside. Otherwise good experience with my amazing group. Even tough I didn’t pay, the prices are very steep for a tiny portion of meal."

We ordered 2 dozen oysters and followed the waitress recommendation, all the oysters are fresh and delicious! We mentioned that the seafood chowder is a bit salty for us, the waitress immediately waived the bill for the chowder. I would like to say their service is a five star level, they let customer feel reliable and comfortable. I will recommend this place to my friends!"

They sat us, served drinks, and asked about our friend who had brought her own food. She acted as if everything was fine. She came back to take our orders. After about 10 minutes of getting our drinks and our friend halfway through eating her food, the manager came to us and asked us to leave. He said that they couldn't allow outside food into the restaurant. So, we left before actually getting our food. As we were walking in a couple was leaving because they weren't getting any service. No go..."
Brakish,Seafood,"2 Lower Water Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4A2 Canada",PEI,46.23211,-63.1234,5,A wonderful patio!! Taylor and Carlos provided us with excellent service! Very reasonably priced.

Brakish,Seafood,"2 Lower Water Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4A2 Canada",PEI,46.23211,-63.1234,4,"Great place to bring your dog, their patio is essentially a dog park with chairs. Very cozy and casual.

Service was underwhelming. Waited 5 minutes to be seated, despite most of the patio area being empty.

Our order was taken promptly after we were seated and the food came in under 10 minutes.

We got fish and chips, it was a little greasy and not fresh, but that's to be expected. Good food overall, loved the fries.

It was quite a while before we saw our waitress again. Everyone at the table next to us stood up and flagged the staff down because they were tired of waiting for their bill. Eventually we had to do the same.

As the temperature began to drop, we noticed the staff bringing blankets to other guests, so that was nice for them.

TL;DR
Good food, slow service, got the impression that they were slightly understaffed and perhaps a bit inefficient, but it is by far the most dog friendly place in Charlottetown."
John Brown Richmond Street Grille,American (Traditional),"132 Richmond Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1H9 Canada",PEI,46.23389,-63.126567,5,"Perfect dinner, especially when we went to the Hunter restaurant recommended by a friend just after the plane landed, and they didn't let us in.  Came to this lively and delicious restaurant.  The staff are very welcoming.  The staff helped me choose a very weak beer suitable for ladies.  I am very happy with my beer alas.  Serve with seafood pasta and seafood tacos.  Very satisfied listening to music and drinking wine.  The first day of our PEI trip ended perfectly."
John Brown Richmond Street Grille,American (Traditional),"132 Richmond Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1H9 Canada",PEI,46.23389,-63.126567,1,"The server was nice and I feel bad she had to take our Calamari back. That said what is the restaurant thinking? We love this island and have had great experiences across the board including culinary but this was a joke.

The beer and wine was fine and the beet salad was good albeit a little pricey for its size but the Calamari I can’t even lol…

Check the two pics first is what the tried serving us with no dip, lemon or anything. We did not have a bite. The second is what typical calamari for the price looks like.

Seriously, if you can’t make a dish up to par, don’t have it on the menu.

Shame that we picked this place and others were open. This was kinda a night killer but whatever I hope they use this review to get better or remove this item from their menu.

Oh yeah once again we did not take one bite of that plate lol."

The bowl of chowder was a huge portion and was rich and hearty.
The seafood pasta had great ingredients,  steak bites were perfectly cooked and the pretzel bites was like the cherry on top!

Service from the bar was prompt in food and drinks,  and the drinks were flowing well!

Highly recommend for a stop in if you're visiting Charlottetown !"

Highly recommended!"
John Brown Richmond Street Grille,American (Traditional),"132 Richmond Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1H9 Canada",PEI,46.23389,-63.126567,5,"I absolutely loved the Big Andy Burger. It was superb and made my tummy very happy. Just the right amount of spice and savory from that jalapeno aioli. My friend go the fish and chips which were also very nice, flakey, and cooked perfectly - the tartar sauce was good and flavorful.

The beer selection was very good! I was able to sample a few to see what I liked best and choose from those. The Gahan blueberry wheat beer was especially yummy. The beer could have been colder though, as I found it was a bit warmer when it was served but still appropriately cool; this was more of a personal preference.

Service was great too! Fairly normal wait time for a busy place, and the staff were very quick to help you out with a request. I'd certainly recommend this place to friends.

One last thing - the live music was a nice touch and they were great performances."
The Chip Shack,Seafood,"2 Great George Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4K6 Canada",PEI,46.2325652,-63.1226719,4,"Great little spot! The vibe of this place was super positive - with lots of lovely outdoor seating - and the people working there were super lovely :)

Lobster roll with fries for only $22! Coming from Toronto, I was certainly expecting a higher price point, and was pleasantly surprised. The roll was a bit smaller than I would expect; BUT AGAIN, the price was at least 6$ cheaper than what I have seen elsewhere. And the food tasted great! Well seasoned lobster, buttery crispy exterior on the bun, and the fries were perfect!

I would come back again for sure :)"
The Chip Shack,Seafood,"2 Great George Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4K6 Canada",PEI,46.2325652,-63.1226719,5,"If you want something different this is the place.
The fish has some different batter, in a good way.
Fries seen to be the real ones had cut, and wild fish as well
Pulled pork poutine was good too
Good customer service .
We recommend it"
The Chip Shack,Seafood,"2 Great George Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4K6 Canada",PEI,46.2325652,-63.1226719,3,"Ordered the lobster roll, fish sandwich and a beer.  I believe the lobster roll was $24, the fish sandwich was $14 and the beer was $8.

Overall, the lobster roll was okay but didn't come with full chunks of lobster.  There were a few chunks with shredded lobster.  The bread used for the rolls was very good.  The fish sandwich was also okay, and the fries were tasty and very crispy.

The staff were very nice and the shack is located in a great spot."

But it’s good to see that she can take a break every once in a while and trust her staff to do an excellent job just like her. Everyone was professional, friendly, and helpful. The food is great, the homemade french fries with their homemade garlic dip is a must. I’ve been here before and I will be back many many more times."

The owner is an amazingly high energy beautifully kind person. She has chosen her staff very wisely, and on the odd time when she’s not there they take over seamlessly. The food is amazing. The lobster roll is incredible. My absolute favourite is the homemade french fries with the yummy yummy garlic dip. Keep up the incredible work guys. Look forward to seeing you each year, I will be back over and over and over."

Row House Lobster,Seafood,"146 Richmond Street Charlottetown, PE C1A Canada",PEI,46.2340687,-63.1261798,4,We stopped in here for a much needed late lunch. It was quiet at the time. My wife had an excellent lobster roll. I had lobster poutine. There was just enough lobster to keep me satisfied.  My wife also had the chowder which was great as well. They have a handful of beers on tap as well too. A decent place to grab lunch after a long day for sure.
Row House Lobster,Seafood,"146 Richmond Street Charlottetown, PE C1A Canada",PEI,46.2340687,-63.1261798,5,"What can I say? Loved the place!
Nice ambience, fantastic food, and great service!
Our server Angela was super friendly, fun and entertaining, as well as kind enough to give us a crash course on dealing with our first whole lobster.
We decided to go all in and opted for the Church Main - a whole lobster, preceded by a chowder and a bowl of clams, and followed by a dessert.
The chowder was very smooth and creamy, with teragon being ""the secret ingredient"". The clams were great with their souse.
And the lobster - just delicious.
Turtle cheesecake in a jar was the cherry on top.
Not a cheap dinner, but the experience was well worth every dollar!"

Friendly staff, but got a little attitude when we declined the food menu prior to a show we were going to. Took them more than 10 minutes to bring our drinks. On the other side, we had 2 nice waiters asking us if we were ok a few times ( not our waitress). As we were going for dinner on a Saturday night, because it was highly recommended, they were closed for inventory!  Why would you close on a Saturday during tourist season?"

The all of appetizer could've been made excellent by getting some smoke flavour to the olives, as well as serving them warm with just a minimal amount of orange zest, grated on top.
My wife had an appetizer that was mozzarella cheese, wrapped in prosciutto with a marinara sauce. We both believe that the cheese ratio should've been higher as well as a pan sear on the prosciutto before putting into the marinara sauce with it elevated this dish. We both have the pizza different times, and it was excellent."
Piatto Pizzeria + Enoteca,Pizza,"45 Queen Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4A4 Canada",PEI,46.2322303,-63.1256482,5,"I was thrilled to stumble upon this delicious Italian oasis on a rainy and windy Sunday night in Charlottetown.

For those of you new to the east coast, myself included, you will quickly learn that pretty much everything is closed on a Sunday (and Monday and Tuesday)! But not this place!!!

The butternut squash soup was a great way to warm up from the cold, and the pizza was light and satisfying (we got the vegan pizza with real cheese, as was suggested by our waiter. He was, dare I say, a genius!)

Finished off the meal with tiramisu in a jar, cuz we’re cool like that."
Piatto Pizzeria + Enoteca,Pizza,"45 Queen Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4A4 Canada",PEI,46.2322303,-63.1256482,5,"Nested between the various shops and numerous restaurants crowding Queen Street in Charlottetown, the Piatto may be easily missed by the inattentive passerby in a hurry. From the outside, the venue has a low profile compared to many of the flashier eateries lining the street.

I went in blind, without prior knowledge of the place despite living quite nearby and passing it frequently. I entered the Piatto and was almost immediately welcomed and seated - there was a friendly ambiance and familiar vibe from the moment I set foot inside the restaurant.

My server Marlow introduced himself, and offered me the menu. I looked at the various options, but eventually decided to ask him for recommendations - he gladly obliged, and suggested some favourites, as well as something based on my preferences for something with many toppings. Marlow spoke passionately about each dish, and eventually I settled for a simple, delicious classic - the Siciliana.

The Siciliana was served surprisingly quickly, and looked beautiful. At first I thought that I might not be able to finish a 10"" pizza by myself, but the pizza was light and refreshing, with a balance of fresh veggies and evenly spread proteins. Every bite introduced my taste buds to fresh peppers, tomatoes, and basil, all complemented by some light cheese. If you go in expecting your typical heavy, fat American pizza, you might want to reconsider. But if you are looking for a more authentic, fresh, handcrafted pizza, look no further than the Piatto."
Piatto Pizzeria + Enoteca,Pizza,"45 Queen Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4A4 Canada",PEI,46.2322303,-63.1256482,5,"Great food - really great, in fact. Great service. Wonderful that they have vegan options my partner could enjoy. Could have done without the live music - too loud and not very entertaining. We were there to eat, not listen to some guy sing The Unicorn by the Irish Rovers. Overall, recommended."
Splendid Essence,Vegetarian,"186 Prince Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1P1 Canada",PEI,46.2376164,-63.126296,5,I have been to this place multiple times over years when visiting Charlottetown. The dishes are delicious and the staff friendly. We have even ordered takeouts for 10 people this year. They say if we give them more advanced time they can prepare trays. But we ordered an hour ahead so it was all separate dishes. All good and all clear. They have a small Buddha hall upstairs. Check it out next time!
Splendid Essence,Vegetarian,"186 Prince Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1P1 Canada",PEI,46.2376164,-63.126296,5,"The best vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Charlottetown, hands down. The pricing is fair, service is great, and the atmosphere is always so calm and welcoming. Several times in the past, the staff have given out treats for special holidays as well which is always greatly appreciated. Don't miss out on trying this place if you're looking for some delicious veg food in town."
Splendid Essence,Vegetarian,"186 Prince Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1P1 Canada",PEI,46.2376164,-63.126296,4,"Nice menu selection and good vegan options. However, it seems like the spice we expect from this style of restaurant in other cities has been tamed down for Maritimes palates."
Splendid Essence,Vegetarian,"186 Prince Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1P1 Canada",PEI,46.2376164,-63.126296,3,"Stopped here for some vegan food for dinner — service was good if a bit slow. Food was fine, but nothing more; perhaps we had three dishes that were ‘misses’, but we weren’t super impressed with the flavours or quality. Overall a good enough experience, it seems that many people love this place so take what we say with a grain of salt."

We had a really good time with great seats.  We shared the bacon wrapped scallops and the spinach dip.  The scallops were large and cooked perfectly.  My friend ordered the blueberry ale, which she loved.  Very attentive waitress and we appreciated that she told us that the spinach dip would take a bit longer and we were asked if we wanted the scallops first or to have them held to come out with the dip.  Definitely worth a return trip!"
The Old Triangle,Irish,"189 Great George Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4L1 Canada",PEI,46.2367858,-63.1287852,4,"The food was very filling. One entree can fill you to the brim. We made the mistake of ordering appetizers. The food was too salty for me but good. Waitress was very kind and checked on us often. We ordered potato skins which was more nacho form with potato skins and a giant plate full. Then we ordered the steak n steak n colcannon and the Irish stew. The stew came with colcannon and Irish brown bread. I finished everything and am not proud to say that I proceeded to have the worst gas of my life. I think my entire intestine was inflated by the end of the night. My husband loved the food and for the first time in his life could not finish the second steak. I think if I were to go back, I’d have to order something smaller and not be so ambitious haha."
The Old Triangle,Irish,"189 Great George Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4L1 Canada",PEI,46.2367858,-63.1287852,4,I love the Irish coffee. The platter was perfect to share with friends. There was Live-Music which makes good vibes.

Seoul Food,Korean,"330 University Avenue Charlottetown, PE C1A 4M4 Canada",PEI,46.2422178,-63.1320673,1,Ordered the fried chicken and I have one question... Do you not believe in seasoning??? It was so bland and boring and just  meh. Never had it but I think boiled chicken would still be seasoned better and that's some in a a whole league on their own and not a good one. Over priced and boring. Only pro was that the skin was a perfect crisp which at least it had texture. Not sure about the rest of their food but I hope they do better.
Seoul Food,Korean,"330 University Avenue Charlottetown, PE C1A 4M4 Canada",PEI,46.2422178,-63.1320673,5,Ideal location for a quick bite or takeout. Delicious famous Korean dishes and asian styled flavoring. Their shop is a little bit small so it might get crowded.

Merchantman,Seafood,"23 Queen Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4A2 Canada",PEI,46.231719,-63.124843,4,"Prior to moving to PEI, I tried the Merchantman (Patio) and had an underwhelming experience, poor service and poor presentation of my meal. Fast forward to last week when our family came to visit and they made a reservation, which worried me 😬, but thankfully my concerns were completely unfounded.  We sat in the restaurant, the service was okay, but the food was excellent, especially the “Island Seafood Boil”, our server advised the portion was large and suggested it was a meal for two! Thank goodness we took heed of his suggestion, it was huge and definitely a meal for 2, the scallops were cooked perfectly and lots of them,  as were the mussels, clams, shrimp and snow crab and lobster.  I now know where we can go for that special occasion and have a wonderful seafood feast, that we love so much.
I know a lot of people are are very critical of establishments and if they have one bad experience they won’t return, if we had subscribed to that philosophy, it would have been our loss. Thanks Merchantman for improving your game! 😀"
Merchantman,Seafood,"23 Queen Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4A2 Canada",PEI,46.231719,-63.124843,2,"Appetizers were great, the baked oysters especially. Would recommend.

The sangria was a good price for the size.

Disappointed in the meals. The beef was low quality and kinda tasted like wild meat. The lobster role came on a hot dog bun!!! Tasted very processed. Do not recommend.

Sat down at 8pm (reservation). We were going to order desert but was advised the kitchen closed at 9pm..... oddly, a table was seated after 9pm and still received food...???"
Merchantman,Seafood,"23 Queen Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4A2 Canada",PEI,46.231719,-63.124843,2,"We went here last week after strolling adorable downtown Charlottetown. They couldn't get us in to the main restaurant so we walked around to their patio area 'Next Door'. There was live music and sunshine so we had high hopes however after sitting we were ignored for quite a while, others who came after us were served drinks before we were acknowledged at all. Once we were served, the gin fizz I ordered wasn't at all as described in the menu so I mentioned it and he offered something else. I got a glass of wine instead. After the long delay plus some other mishaps with delivery of our appetizers (raw oysters with underwhelming presentation and scallops with pork belly that weren't gluten free due to the maple whiskey glaze for some reason) we decided to end it there rather than risk further disappointment. There also weren't many gluten free options.
We noticed later that they'd charged us for the higher priced gin fizz rather than the wine. A mistake or a grab for more money, either way poor form. Perhaps just bad luck that night but I wouldn't return or recommend."

Wait time for just a coffee/latte is way too long. I work in an office nearby and the few times I've popped in to get a mid-afternoon coffee I've waited much too long. It appears only one person is ever able to make espresso based drinks which leads to a bottleneck and the wait for drinks being much longer than needed or expected.

Don't come expecting to grab a quick coffee."

Silver Streams Restaurant,Chinese,"7 St. Peters Road Charlottetown, PE C1A 5N3 Canada",PEI,46.2466838,-63.1236574,2,The staff was kind but almost to extremes.. coming over to see how things are every couple of minutes! I suppose they could just ignore you like the previous owners did but they could definitely slow down a little bit! The buffet was alright but the rice was sort of chemically tasting and the ribs had a bit too much fat compared to what I’m use too. All in all it was an OK experience!
Silver Streams Restaurant,Chinese,"7 St. Peters Road Charlottetown, PE C1A 5N3 Canada",PEI,46.2466838,-63.1236574,2,"I dont often complain or feel the need to review experiences however tonight was unacceptable from a consumer standpoint.

I Ordered from door dash. Was hoping for a good chinese meal as a treat after a long week. What i got was nothing near what i expected.
I ordered the shrimp and mushroom dish. Kung Po Chicken, an order of chicken chow mein and an egg roll.
90% of what i ordered will not be eaten.

The kung Po chicken was by far the worst ive ever had. It was more of a spicy raw onion soup than it was anything even resembling Kung Po chicken.

The Mushroom Shrimp was alright, again, VERY watery and soup-ey. I was able to eat some of it but it very much lacked any flavor.

The chicken chow mein was basically steamed bean sprouts with very little chicken to be seen and absolutely no flavor.

If not for the egg roll, Which was delicious, this rating would have been 1 star.

Cherry on top? They use paper bags to deliver... it was left at my door with a SOAKED bottom. It all fell out when i lifted it up. Thank god i hadnt picked it all the way up or i wouldnt have got to eat anything. Not that it made much of a difference in the end..."

However, the service was a little slow, but that's kind of expected for Mother's Day. Also, I found what looked to be a Claw. I'm not sure what from but I'm assuming maybe a chicken. One thing that I love about this restaurant is that they do so much good in the community! I rate Silver Streams a 3/5, and I will probably be back!"

Olde Dublin Pub,Seafood,"131 Sydney Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1G5 Canada",PEI,46.233763,-63.126065,5,"The Olde Dublin Pub is an absolute gem of a place. From the moment you step inside, you're transported to a cozy, welcoming atmosphere that's steeped in history and tradition. The decor is classic and timeless, with wooden beams, exposed brick, and vintage Irish memorabilia adorning the walls.

But the real star of the show is the food and drink. The pub offers a wide selection of Irish and local beers on tap, as well as an extensive menu of classic pub fare with a modern twist. The fish and chips are some of the best I've ever had, and the shepherd's pie is hearty and flavorful. But the real standout is the Irish stew - it's a must-try!"
Olde Dublin Pub,Seafood,"131 Sydney Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1G5 Canada",PEI,46.233763,-63.126065,1,"It was highly-rated and praised, so we made our choice comfortably - thinking we would have quality food that’s affordable.

Alas, the oysters served were extremely dirty and badly presented. The oysters were laid on top of one another, causing the oysters below to be contaminated with the shell remnants of the oysters above them. Mignonette was promised alongside the lemons and cocktail sauce, but unfortunately none was served.
Many of the oysters weren’t even properly removed from their base (the adductor muscle). The oysters had SO much debris inside it was VERY obvious that they didn’t even bother purging them (soaking them for 10 mins in ice cold water so they can spit out the dirt from within).
It was a filthy and grainy experience that truly took away from our love for oysters.

BUT THAT IS NOT ALL!

The chowder. Oh my god. We ordered the chowder right after the oysters, and I was in complete shock at the state that it arrived in. I’ll insert a video below. The CONSISTENCY was HORRID. It was far from creamy. I am very, very rarely offended, and I felt personally insulted that the chef actually looked at these bowls and thought this was good enough to send out. Where are the standards?! It was bland, the seafood inside were severely overcooked, and it was the consistency of broth. After voicing our dislike for the chowders, they still charged us for them even though we didn’t even have a second bite! I’m absolutely mind blown. 🤯

We tipped the servers and didn’t take away from anyone’s hard work, but we didn’t feel equally appreciated as customers.

It was our first ever meal arriving in PEI, and what a disappointing experience it was. We stormed out, bellies hungry and our pockets significantly emptier, searching for another place to have dinner for the night after our long road trip there."

Olde Dublin Pub,Seafood,"131 Sydney Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1G5 Canada",PEI,46.233763,-63.126065,2,Oysters were fine but mignonette wasn’t provided contrary to the menu. Cocktail sauce is very basic. Five ounce bacon wrapped filet was passable but stringy. Nothing special here. Fish with the fish and chips was outright terrible. Overcooked and didn’t have the consistency of quality fish. Try Churchill’s on Queen St instead. Much better. Service was okay but slow. $90 for a sub-par meals. Not recommended.

Lobster On The Wharf,Seafood,"2 Prince Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 8C1 Canada",PEI,46.2326716,-63.1202325,5,"So we are new to the whole seafood so after some extensive research we settled on this gem. Located conveniently by the waterfront and docks,the view is breathtaking. I settled for the lobster roll as I would of locked myself if I didn’t at least try. It was mouth watering. I couldn’t believe I waited so long to try one. The service was impeccable as was the restrooms. Parking is possible on the street but better off using the parking lot that’s right next door."

The food was good and reasonably priced.  Had the lobster macaroni and cheese, crab cakes and fries  The macaroni and cheese was absolutely delicious!  The crab cakes were good but are very potato forward.  The fries are Cavendish fries and we're very tasty and crispy.  A bit over seasoned but still good."

China King Buffet Restaurant,Chinese,"660 University Avenue Charlottetown, PE C1E 1E5 Canada",PEI,46.2639233,-63.1460111,1,"Not a chance are all these amazing reviews legit.  The service was very prompt and friendly but that is absolutely where the positive ends!  The food was a 2/10 at the most generous!  We have never had totally bland Chinese food before but here it is!  Nothing tasted bad, because it would actually have to taste like something to begin with.  We have traveled a lot of countries and we can without a doubt award this place with a ""world's most flavourless"" trophy!
The caption on the bottom of the sign would be a travesty for Charlottetown if it's true!

China King Buffet Restaurant,Chinese,"660 University Avenue Charlottetown, PE C1E 1E5 Canada",PEI,46.2639233,-63.1460111,5,"I recently visited King's BBQ Chinese Restaurant and I was thoroughly impressed. They had multiple choices of delicious dishes to choose from, and the atmosphere was very warm and inviting. The service was very polite and the prices were very good. The highlight of my meal was the sweet and sour pork (I forgot the exact name) and the eggplant - it was cooked to perfection. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great Chinese dining experience."
China King Buffet Restaurant,Chinese,"660 University Avenue Charlottetown, PE C1E 1E5 Canada",PEI,46.2639233,-63.1460111,3,Service is not that great. But the owner is really nice and approachable. We just waited long enough to finish the side dish before the rice came out from the kitchen. Maybe they could bring out rice and side dish at the same time so we can enjoy our meal.
China King Buffet Restaurant,Chinese,"660 University Avenue Charlottetown, PE C1E 1E5 Canada",PEI,46.2639233,-63.1460111,2,"Not authentic Chinese food. Too oily and saucy for authentic noodle. The ingredients used for wonton soup was also not authentic. Overall taste was ok.
They also had many photo displays for more authentic Chinese food but they cannot be ordered, “we haven’t make them in such a long time” I was told by the server as they served the wrong food to me.
I was looking forward to try this place but I am disappointed now."

I ordered sweet and sour chicken they left the chicken out I'll lay in it out with a lot of broth and vegetables.....
I also got something I never ordered and I have no idea what those brown crispy things are.....

The barbecue pork was good"

Use to frequent here often now only once a month and after this experience I'm done. Frys are always soggy and not fried at all, basically just wet potatoes soaked in cold oil, chicken is missing the wing, skin is not on the breast and the chicken is dryer than a maple leaf in October. Please someone quality check what's coming out of your kitchen."

Redwater Rustic Grille,Canadian (New),"123 Grafton Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4K6 Canada",PEI,46.2351606,-63.1274806,3,"Overall is ok.
Beautiful interior and a good atmosphere.
The dishes sold beautifully at Unreasonable high prices!!!
The portions are too small that they should be, especially for the main course.
""Srimps&Scalops"" consist of 4 shrimps + 3 scallops, with a few baby potatoes with sauce for 45$. So..  it was not enough for my 13-een year son; he remained hungry..

I would not return to the restaurant a second time."
Redwater Rustic Grille,Canadian (New),"123 Grafton Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4K6 Canada",PEI,46.2351606,-63.1274806,5,"I cannot begin to express how much my wife and I LOVED Redwater! The dining room was very comfortable and classy. Our server was a very nice, polite young fella that was very versed in the menu.

The mussels were phenomenal! My wife throughly enjoyed her burger and Yukon gold mash and I had the best mushroom risotto! So full of flavor. And the margherita and basil flatbread had an amazing crust. Tender-chew with a nice crunch. The pesto made the flavor pop off the plate! Just fanatic!

And, because we were celebrating our anniversary, they gave us a piece dark chocolate cheesecake with a Chantilly cream that was out of this world!! I mean, we could have eaten 2 of those bad boys! Such a thoughtful gesture on their part. We will DEFINITELY be returning to this gem!

We've been looking for a good place to eat in town and we finally found it, and then some!"
Redwater Rustic Grille,Canadian (New),"123 Grafton Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4K6 Canada",PEI,46.2351606,-63.1274806,5,"Went to the Redwater Rustic Grille for lunch today after an absolutely terrible experience at another restaurant nearby that we walked out of.  This experience was completely different.

First, our waiter was absolutely fantastic…knowledgeable, attentive, friendly.  The food was absolutely fantastic.  I had the soup of the day, a roasted red pepper soup to die for!  My main course was the Maple Chipotle BBQ Chicken stone baked flatbread.  DELICIOUS!  And to top it off, coffee and Sticky Toffee Pudding with rum sauce and chantilly cream.  Everything from the atmosphere, the incredible waiter and the awesome food was such a wonderful experience.  And the price was more than reasonable!  Highly recommended!"
Redwater Rustic Grille,Canadian (New),"123 Grafton Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4K6 Canada",PEI,46.2351606,-63.1274806,5,"Redwater Rustic Grille has a great menu with top quality food. I am a longtime fan of their grilled caesar salad with chicken. Unlike any others I have eaten, theirs has am amazing dressing flavored with jalapeños.

For the next few weeks it is part of the Winterdine festival where top restaurants offer specials for lunch and dinners, changing offerings each week.

This week they are offering chicken and waffles with chicken gravy and an incredible chipotle dipping sauce that tastes like an incredible honey mustard sauce.

The chicken was crispy, boneless and had some heat. It was accompanied by a perfectly dressed wild lettuce salad that cut the richness of the chicken and waffles.

My husband, not a fan of sauces, gravities or dips practically liked his chipotle cup clean and finished mine. :-)

I asked to meet the chef to tank him for a terrific lunch. Because of the promotion of Winterdine it was a bargain, with mint chocolate affogato with a brown butter shortbread cookie.

If you can, book a lunch while winterdine is in effect. Redwater Rustic Grille isn’t a cheap lunch normally, but worth it.

At $20 it’s bargain! A great time to become acquainted with one of the best restaurants in the Maritimes."
Redwater Rustic Grille,Canadian (New),"123 Grafton Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4K6 Canada",PEI,46.2351606,-63.1274806,1,"Love the atmosphere - hate the food. Neither myself or my guest enjoyed the meals, the menu is limited, and the prices are too high for what's offered. The space itself is very cozy and nice."
Fishbones,Seafood,"136 Richmond Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1H9 Canada",PEI,46.234003,-63.12635,4,"Prior to moving to PEI, I tried the Merchantman (Patio) and had an underwhelming experience, poor service and poor presentation of my meal. Fast forward to last week when our family came to visit and they made a reservation, which worried me 😬, but thankfully my concerns were completely unfounded.  We sat in the restaurant, the service was okay, but the food was excellent, especially the “Island Seafood Boil”, our server advised the portion was large and suggested it was a meal for two! Thank goodness we took heed of his suggestion, it was huge and definitely a meal for 2, the scallops were cooked perfectly and lots of them,  as were the mussels, clams, shrimp and snow crab and lobster.  I now know where we can go for that special occasion and have a wonderful seafood feast, that we love so much.
I know a lot of people are are very critical of establishments and if they have one bad experience they won’t return, if we had subscribed to that philosophy, it would have been our loss. Thanks Merchantman for improving your game! 😀"
Fishbones,Seafood,"136 Richmond Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1H9 Canada",PEI,46.234003,-63.12635,2,"Appetizers were great, the baked oysters especially. Would recommend.

The sangria was a good price for the size.

Disappointed in the meals. The beef was low quality and kinda tasted like wild meat. The lobster role came on a hot dog bun!!! Tasted very processed. Do not recommend.

Sat down at 8pm (reservation). We were going to order desert but was advised the kitchen closed at 9pm..... oddly, a table was seated after 9pm and still received food...???"
Fishbones,Seafood,"136 Richmond Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 1H9 Canada",PEI,46.234003,-63.12635,2,"We went here last week after strolling adorable downtown Charlottetown. They couldn't get us in to the main restaurant so we walked around to their patio area 'Next Door'. There was live music and sunshine so we had high hopes however after sitting we were ignored for quite a while, others who came after us were served drinks before we were acknowledged at all. Once we were served, the gin fizz I ordered wasn't at all as described in the menu so I mentioned it and he offered something else. I got a glass of wine instead. After the long delay plus some other mishaps with delivery of our appetizers (raw oysters with underwhelming presentation and scallops with pork belly that weren't gluten free due to the maple whiskey glaze for some reason) we decided to end it there rather than risk further disappointment. There also weren't many gluten free options.
We noticed later that they'd charged us for the higher priced gin fizz rather than the wine. A mistake or a grab for more money, either way poor form. Perhaps just bad luck that night but I wouldn't return or recommend."

Came here pretty early ~730am, so had no issue sitting down and getting quick service. The coffee here was amazing - large portions, for both the lattes and cappuccino. The breakfast portions were amazing - had both the Casa Mia Eggs Benny and the Casa Mia Hash. Very tasty, well seasoned, and eggs prepared on point. Price range is also decent for the quality and size of food."

I found this restaurant from a video on tiktok and I’m so glad we came!!! The food, amazing! Our server Ernie was so attentive and warm. We had the fish & chips, muscles in white wine sauce, Siciliana pizza & bruschetta, sooo good!
They also make an amazing espresso martini. If you’re on the island, it’s absolutely worth the stop! 10/10 recommend!"

I ordered a croissant sandwich without meat, they put ham on it and it was sooo soggy. Was pretty gross to be honest. Coffee wasn’t anything special, prices were really high and the service left a lot to be desired. The decor is cute."

I get really, really hungry sometimes and I think the ramen is tasty & hits the spot. The miso soup and glass noodles that come complimentary before the food are great!

Water Street Fish & Chips,Fish & Chips,"73 Water Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4J7 Canada",PEI,46.232349,-63.1247501,3,"I’m giving this place a 3.5 rating because I really, really appreciate their effort to provide gluten-free options for their battered foods.  Unfortunately, there was a mix-up - just as the Skip driver was arriving, the restaurant called to say he had taken the wrong order and needed to return.  By the time I got my food, the fish batter was soggy on the underside.  The batter also did not stick to the fish so I ended up eating the two separately.  It also needed salt.

As you can see in the picture, it came with two very large pieces of haddock.  Also included an extra tartar sauce.

Next time I’m on the Island, I will dine in and hopefully be able to update my review."

Not much flavor in the broth, very weak and watery. Bland noodles. Hearing microwave oven when waiting for your food at a restaurant is never a good sign. But here we are.

Not sure if I went there at a wrong time or the place is past it’s prime. Reviews more recent than mine will tell."

I am from Vietnam and I can say that this was one of the closest to an authentic taste that I have here in PEI. Had the vermicelli with grilled pork and it was one of the best I ever had.

The owner was nice, I came in, order the food and came out hot, crispy. Ate a bite, and now coming back again for another bowl

If you want some good Vietnamese food, this is the place 🤤

Bonus point for the price being very affordable!"

It is not the excellent one when compare to the good one in Toronto, but it definitely above average. Service also good. When you consider try Pho, this could be a nice choice in PEI."

Last time fried rice was dry, eggrolls were underdone, chicken balls were a little hard and spareribs were great.  Feels like they are making too much food and it is sitting too long.  Too bad....used to love this place."
Canton Cafe,Chinese,"73 Queen Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4A8 Canada",PEI,46.2328331,-63.1263619,1,"Went there  last summer. Sadly, first and last time visiting. They state on the restaurant that they serve both Chinese and Canadian food, we asked about the hamburger platter and the waitress told us it was meant for sharing so we ordered one for the two of us (the price also indicated it was bigger than the individual hamburger). Once it arrived, in actually consisted of the smallest hamburger I've ever been served and a lot of french fries. The meat was so overcooked it was hard. My husband ordered another burger and the quality of the meat was so bad it had hard chunks in it that were impossible to chew and it was also overcooked. We were disappointed because the food also took so long to arrive we were already too hundry and had no other option but to eat it, but that wasn't a pleasant experience at all so even though we were hungry, we didn't finish our meal."

One reviewer described it as “Canadian Chinese food” and I would agree.

I’ll be back for more of the egg rolls though, as they are fantastic."

Got a combo plate. Chicken Balls and rice were pretty good. Rice was acceptable and the egg rolls were awesome. However the ribs tasted bland and I couldn't put my finger on why but seemed like they could have been reheated. Not sure but something was up with them!"
Canton Cafe,Chinese,"73 Queen Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4A8 Canada",PEI,46.2328331,-63.1263619,1,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!! I have been eating here for atleast the past 10 years and I will never again!! I live in the country now amd spent easily $20 in gas yesterday not to mention time to drive there and home for simply chicken balls chicken 4 extra fried rice and 3 eggrolls and they only filled the chicken ball order, naturally I called back and explained and after 20 minutes on the phone they agreed to redo the order and for pick up the next day (today). Called in today to make sure the order was ready for pick up and they sent a single order and then expected me to drive back in to show my recipete once again to get it rite!! Food was awful  chicken was way chewy and rice not great  chin balls over done and the one egg roll we actually for was not cooked properly."
DQ Grill & Chill Restaurant,Fast Food,"365 University Ave Charlottetown, PE C1A 4N2 Canada",PEI,46.2436888,-63.1340666,4,Food was great.  The service is rated lower as it took over 15 minutes for order of burger and fries to be made.  Was not expecting that much delay for the meal.  There was plenty of staff but they seemed more focused on the drive through and the ice cream orders.
DQ Grill & Chill Restaurant,Fast Food,"365 University Ave Charlottetown, PE C1A 4N2 Canada",PEI,46.2436888,-63.1340666,2,"If it's after 10pm, and you're looking for somewhere to dine-in, don't go here; they might kick you out earlier than expected.

So anyways, before I headed out, I checked the store's hours on the website. Says 10am-Midnight basically. No separate hours section for dine-in versus drive thru like say Wendy's or McDonalds do on theirs. I take a walk down hoping it's accurate. Get there around 10:45pm. I glance at the door on my way in; no hours sign. Need to hope the site is accurate.

Cashier takes my order, asking me dine-in or take-out, no mention of the dining room closing soon. A few minutes later my food comes out, still no mention of the dining room closing soon.  At 11:05 one of the staff comes to my table and tells me the dining room closes at 11pm and I have 5 minutes. I was alone so I doubt it was an excuse for something like being noisy. Maybe the cleaning staff just wanted to leave early and went rogue without management's knowledge.

Either way, seems their stated hours are just a suggestion or something. If you're looking to relax but it's late, pick somewhere else or you might get badgered out the door here."
DQ Grill & Chill Restaurant,Fast Food,"365 University Ave Charlottetown, PE C1A 4N2 Canada",PEI,46.2436888,-63.1340666,1,"Went there for lunch for a chicken salad… they give you 1 dressing for a side salad, then when you get a large salad double the size they still only give you ONE dressing.. went to ask for a second and was told I had to pay an extra dollar for a second dressing because THEY don’t give you enough dressing for a full salad and want you to pay for an extra dressing! They were rude, the service was horrible! We had to wait 20 mins for kids ice cream my 3 year old was having a meltdown and I’m sure they made me wait because I was upset about having to buy a second dressing and having to put a dollar on my credit card. I’ll be heading to Wendy’s cause they don’t charge extra for condiments they give you more then you need.. I was scared they were going to charge me for a refill of pop too. 🤦‍♀️"
DQ Grill & Chill Restaurant,Fast Food,"365 University Ave Charlottetown, PE C1A 4N2 Canada",PEI,46.2436888,-63.1340666,1,"I ordered the salad.  My friends ordered burgers after me and got their food before I did.  The salad was delivered without dressing.  Also they have a rule that you have to ask a worker to unlock the bathroom before you can use it.  Their ice cream is great, but I will not be ordering the salad in future."

Came here twice and was very satisfied both times. First time we tried the fries with sea salt and that was great. The second time we tried zesty pepper and it was very flavorful but became way too salty. The staff members were nice and the place was clean. Would come here again 👌
Boom Burger,Burgers,"403 Capital Drive Charlottetown, PE C1E 1Z3 Canada",PEI,46.2582683,-63.1810195,1,"I have an allergy to gluten and dairy I told them about this. I ordered my wife’s food then mine. My wife gets the zesty fries (which we were told it contains gluten or dairy at our last visit) and the works put all the fries in with my gluten free burger. So I can’t eat any of it, they offered to make my food over but my wife had an appointment so I didn’t have time for that. It also cost 50 dollars for two burgers which I was unable to eat. The employees told my that we always put all the fries with the allergy bag (which is the first time they have ever done it). Each order should have its own bag. So last time I’ll be going back. Use to eat there a lot"

Boom Burger,Burgers,"403 Capital Drive Charlottetown, PE C1E 1Z3 Canada",PEI,46.2582683,-63.1810195,4,"It's a pretty good burger and spot, with lots of options for your meal.
I had a burger, fries and drink. It's pricy for a brown bagged meal- But I do believe the quality is there.

The fries are always in an ""overflow"" style, which makes you feel like you received more than you paid for. Very similar to Five Guys in that way.

I think for the price I'd like a more formidable bun, but it is good flavour wise."
Boom Burger,Burgers,"403 Capital Drive Charlottetown, PE C1E 1Z3 Canada",PEI,46.2582683,-63.1810195,4,"The food is really good quality for fast food. It is a little pricey compared to other fast food places, but you don't get sloppy burgers falling apart. Expect to wait, but you'll enjoy your food when you get it."
China Garden,Chinese,"96 Queen Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4B1 Canada",PEI,46.233524,-63.126583,5,"Definitely worth the visit! Tried China Garden for the first time tonight, despite living only two short blocks away from the restaurant for the past four years; we were two for dinner this evening and selected one of the Combination Dinners - the #2, dinner for 2 - along with an order of crispy wonton chips from the Appetizer menu.

The staff is awesome, they're so warm and friendly and make you feel welcomed from the minute you open the door; it was take-out service only this evening, which suited us just fine, but China Garden would definitely be a really great place to enjoy a dine-in meal.

The service is polite, courteous, and lightening fast; after placing my order I went for a short twenty minute walk around the block and by the time I returned to China Garden to pick up the order it was all packaged up and waiting for me!

The food is super fresh and the portions are generous, there was plenty for the two of us and enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow. There was plenty of plumb, sweet and sour, and soy sauces included; if you require napkins and utensils and things of the sort, just ask the staff and they'll be more than happy to try their best to accommodate you. The prices are very reasonable and you get great value for your money.

I believe someone said in their own review that China Garden is a great end-of-the-night spot and that's definitely true, China Garden reminds me of some of the best hot spots back home in Toronto that were considered a mandatory stop at the end of the night.

Special shout out to Gordie for his excellent customer service this evening!

Sincerely,
Jon"
China Garden,Chinese,"96 Queen Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4B1 Canada",PEI,46.233524,-63.126583,3,"While the food was tasty for Canadian/maritime Chinese food, I would recommend confirming exactly what you are ordering. I ordered chow mein and chop suey and the only difference between the two was one had mushrooms. When I called back to ask if there was a mistake he told me that they are made basically the same. Like I said food was good but I don’t understand why they would have two options on their menu that are the same but under different names."
China Garden,Chinese,"96 Queen Street Charlottetown, PE C1A 4B1 Canada",PEI,46.233524,-63.126583,5,"We ordered combo 2 for 2 today, It was amazing, best eggrolls I have ever have. Everything was perfect with lots of flavor and hot.

Thumbs down , place should be shut down"
Bamboo Garden Restaurant,Chinese,"25 Hopeton Road Stratford, PE C1B 1T6 Canada",PEI,46.2308878,-63.0990787,4,"This was my second time eating here, the first time I didn't have a great experience. Though after hearing so many positive reviews I wanted to give them another go.

The food was tasty, the portions were a good size, and the staff were a delight, and very friendly. The only issue I had was that they must use a significantly more salt or MSG then other Chinese restaurants that I've eaten at. All of us had mouths that felt like the Sahara desert an hour after eating, and we spent the evening drinking water.

To clarify, the last time I ate here, half the food was partially raw. There must have been a new cook in the kitchen at that time, or some kind of significant error. Thankfully there were no issues like that this time, and all the food was well cooked."
Bamboo Garden Restaurant,Chinese,"25 Hopeton Road Stratford, PE C1B 1T6 Canada",PEI,46.2308878,-63.0990787,1,"Very disappointing not really worth the 1 star.
Food was cold but even hot it still would not have been good.  Lacked  any flavor, if you have had good Chinese food before. Be aware! because when you order a dish it is not remotely like what you have had before.  Chicken fried rice, spot the chicken, ginger beef extremely small portion and filled with veg and non tasting beef! Sweet and sour chicken still trying to figure that one out!  I could continue but I think you get the point.
$98.00 wasted.             So disappointing."

Do yourself a favor and DO NOT EAT HERE, if they are willing to let the customers see that in the dining room and are ok with it imagine what is happening in the kitchen.

RGE RD,Canadian (New),"10643 - 123 Street Edmonton, AB T5M 1Z1 Canada",AB,53.5506791,-113.5338299,1,"The restaurant itself was lovely, however we had issues with the food and service. I think I got food poisoning from the bison. I ordered the bison and was told that it is cooked at the perfect point between medium rare and medium. When the bison steak came out it was definitely blue-rare (picture below). I was so disappointed because I cannot stand raw or extremely rare meat and had only ordered this because I had been told it would be between medium rare and medium. My partner’s steak (also pictured) is medium rare for reference. Mine should have been cooked even a bit more than his. I tried a bite anyway to see if there was anyway that it could work; but it was so raw and bloody I just couldn’t stomach it. I told our server about the meat being too undercooked and it was clear she didn’t believe me and I had to stand my ground to be taken seriously. The whole interaction felt condescending, but she did take it back to the kitchen. When she brought it out again, it was *maybe* cooked to rare, but at this point I felt too bad to say anything and I didn’t want to be belittled by the server again. I ate as much as I could, leaving the rawest pieces behind, but I wish I hadn’t as I had an extremely upset stomach when I got home and woke up sick enough to call off of work. This is the first time I’ve been sick in months and it feels clearly related to eating raw/extremely undercooked bison from this restaurant. It’s also concerning because we looked at reviews for this restaurant when we got home and there are many 1 star reviews describing receiving extremely undercooked bison.. I don’t understand why such an expensive restaurant would provide undercooked and potentially dangerous meat?"

It may be a bit of a lesser known haunt as it doesn't have direct access with parking out front. Typically I park around the corner on Rice Howard Way. However, it's a super dining experience offering up smaller plates for sharing and larger ones if you want to go it alone. It's more modern fusion and it's delicious.

The space is very inviting and cozy.  Beautiful stylings make this a very wonderful setting. And the service is always great.

I usually go to Shanghai 456 but I'm so glad I tried this place because in my experience, it's the best Shanghainese restaurant in Edmonton for FLAVOR.

There's only 1 person working so don't expect 5 star service. She was doing her best given the circumstances but man oh man the food is outstanding!

We ordered the braised beef noodle soup, dan dan noodles, pan fried bao and xiao long bao.

The dan dan noodles were average, not enough pork and Sichuan peppercorn flavor.

The pan fried bao and braised beef noodles though were amoung the best I've ever tried. The noodles were of perfect texture, chewy and complimented the rich complex beef broth perfectly.

This is a small restaurant so expect to wait for a table but I can assure you it's well worth the wait.

I highly recommend this place."

BaoBun classic 3.5/5 it was a bit dry.

But overall its great. Will definitely come back and will try other food on their menu.

Update!
Went back two to three times after the first visit. I found the best baobun sandwich is the one with fried  chicken. And still the pork dumpling soup and beef brisket noodles are consistently good. Tried the beef BaoBun it was alright."

The service needs a bit of tweaking.
The water jug wasn’t very clean and they gave us tiny spoons because the soup spoons were all dirty which is something that shouldn’t happen since Chinese soup spoons are dirt cheap to avoid this.
The food more than makes up for it.
We still highly recommend it."

Food was amazing if you’re into Asian fusion you’ll love this place. The baos were awesome and the Indonesian fried rice which is nasi goreng was delicious and actually had a kick to it which was nice. We had some drinks and they were great too. The ube had a subtle but ube flavor and it was my favorite. I will definitely be going back for more!"
Baijiu,Cocktail Bars,"103-10359 104 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5J 1B9 Canada",AB,53.5459109,-113.4986901,3,"This was the first restaurant we tried in Edmonton, Alberta. It was highly recommended by a travel blogger. Location was great- very near the hockey arena. It looks like a bar inside, but they have patio seating with umbrellas for shade. They have a big selection of different cocktails. We had a great server. Food was hit and miss. We ordered the Deviled Tea eggs- and they were very salty- not edible.  The calamari was expensive, but quite ordinary. Be careful with the seasonings on top because it made the dish salty as well. We were getting quite disappointed with the food  until we tasted the  stirf-ried bok choy. It was perfectly cooked with different kinds of mushrooms and garlic ginger, soy sauce. The stems of the bok choy remained crunchy – just the way I like it. We also ordered the Nori Ramen Bowl with shrimp. It was also delicious. It came with cucumber, corn, salsa, red onions, mushroom, and scallions. There was an option to add pork or shrimp or tofu for additional cost. The restaurant was pretty pricey. We spent almost C$100 for two people.  We didn’t order any drinks."
Baijiu,Cocktail Bars,"103-10359 104 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5J 1B9 Canada",AB,53.5459109,-113.4986901,3,"I cringe at seeing ""Asian inspired"". The food here is like food made from a cookbook that was written by a tourist who traveled to tourist- oriented eateries and then the ""chef"" here at Baijiu decided halfway through his cooking to NOT follow the recipe and cover up the lack of authentic flavor with too much salt and mayonnaise... I would have had less expectations if the food wasn't labeled Asian inspired - cuz it's nowhere close to Asian Food.

The chicken tasted like it was made from carnival food batter and the onion balls tasted like a mini donut recipe - not close at all to Asian Food. Overall, I found the food overly salty, covered in too much mayonnaise, and lack nuances of Asian cooking. The food here is basically pub food.

I would have rated this at 2 stars but our bartender was fantastic. We were in the private room with our own bar, so he didn't have all the ingredients to make the menu drinks (which is odd btw). He did, however, made me an Old Fashioned to suit my palate - not-so-sweet cinnamon syrup with mango and Makers Mark. It was super fantasticly delicious. The scotch he suggested was also on point. We had it with ice on the side. The bartender was super accommodating, friendly, and knowledgeable and if we had to, the only reason we would come back to Baijiu would be because of him."

They have great selections of sausages/sides that compliment each other perfectly. Plenty of drink options and there are patio seating outside during a nice summer day! Definitely a great place to visit!

Great selection of delicious in-house made sausages and sides.  Friendly service and fabulous food.  Highly recommend.
Otto Food and Drink,Gastropubs,"11405 95 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5G 1L3 Canada",AB,53.5645034,-113.4869837,5,"I'll admit immediately that we didn't have food but we'll definitely be back. We showed up today and found the restaurant closed because of a private event. The owner, instead of simply sending us on our way, bought us drinks and chatted with us. The drinks (a local prickly pear Moscow mule and a blackberry lemon non alcoholic beer) were delicious but it was the real care the owner took to make sure we were comfortable that made this such a beautiful experience. We'd had a less than stellar afternoon up to this point and I can confidently say that Otto turned it around. The owner was even going to recommend another place to eat but we went to the Italian Centre for sandwiches. Excellent people skills and a true care for the customer.

A week later: we went back to eat and it was stellar. The schnitzel was perfectly cooked, the fries were crisp, and the Brussels sprouts that my partner initially turned up his nose at were so good that I had to fight him for every bite. Great non alcoholic beer selection and excellent service. You can see the people walking in being treated like friends and family. Will definitely come back and eat here again. Thank you, Ed and Natalia, for a lovely evening."

Food was not balanced and was either completely bland or lacking salt which was not expected..
And the food had repeated ingredients and taste was exactly similar between different dishes because of that..We ordered Parmigiano soup which was good but than we Ordered their famous Ravioli and it had exact same soup as the sauce on Ravioli with very little modifications..
Food was tasting very fresh which was good sign but again not enough for their 5 star price point..
Cocktails different taste but were not balanced....The two drinks that we ordered one was over spicy and the other one overpowering peach soju...
Their bar has potential but dirnks were very average for 21$ price tag...
Moving on to ambiance place has a nice decor but its very congested as they tried to fit in as many table as possible in a small space..At this price point they should reduce the table capacity to half..
There was no walking space left once everyone had seated..
Overall an over priced experience for a average place.."
Bundok,Canadian (New),"10228 104 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5J 1B8 Canada",AB,53.5437016,-113.4994695,4,"The broccoli dish was fantastic! We also tried the beets which were great and the bass which neither of us would order again, we just didn't like the flavours. Don't expect to be full unless you spend a small fortune, the portions were not very big as it is a tapas place. The cocktails were great though and service was good."

But what sets this place at the top of the rankings, is the food. Every dish was a hit and beautifully presented. Have you had Parisian gnocchi? Well..  not made with potatoes, it was light, fluffy and I wanted more! The dessert, a lemon posset, so easy to make, yet so delicate and light. A great way to finish a dinner, the addition of the mint was perfect. As for the cocktails... Excellent!"

We brought our 14 month old daughter and she loved the meal too.  The food was amazing - humble ingredients with good flavor and unique sauces!  We absolutely loved the gnocchi and roasted cauliflower.  Yum!  If you like sharing dishes with friends then this is the place to go."

We walked in ans they opened and it was empty and they said they were full but could accomodate us at the bar. Both my partner and I found it excellent. The service was great, ambiance was calm and the food was delicious. The flavors were great. We had the soup to start… I believe it was a mushroom soup but can’t remember it was a couple weeks ago, the gnocchi and the chicken and we all loved it. Had no more room for dessert. We expected smaller portion so we ordered a lot but the portion were also very generous for the amount we paid. The soup was honestly to die for. Wish I had room for dessert! Will be back!"

The cherry chili ribs were good. Glad they give you both lean and fatty pieces of brisket. I thought I didn't like BBQ but it turns out I just didn't like bad BBQ.

Hard to pick a beer from their beverage menu because it is so big and everything sounds so good. The server offered us samples since we couldn't decide. She was very friendly and walked us through the whole menu with every detail. Food was great and ""half portions"" of a little bit of everything we ordered were BIG. Very impressed. Can't wait to come back."

The food was amazing I got the Seared Rainbow Trout. The fish was perfectly cooked and had a crispy salty skin and I was pleasantly surprised at how good the pearled couscous was. It had a really good lemon butter and the cherry tomatoes in it made it taste very fresh and light. I think the pearled couscous carried the trout very well. The Beef Ragù was also very good. My friend ordered it and she enjoyed it a lot. The new location is much bigger but the decor and atmosphere still felt very intimate and cozy. Our server was also very kind and attentive. 10/10 would come back again."

Our waitress, food, and the atmosphere were amazing! I personally had the classic eggs benny with yummy dill hollandaise. My friends had a cappuccino afterwards and said it was great. The only downside i experienced is they don't take reservations for brunch, so we had to wait about an hour for a group of 5, and they were a bit slow on food service. Cute venue with lots of awesome options!"
Blowers & Grafton,Canadian (New),"10550 82 Ave NW Edmonton, AB T6E 2A4 Canada",AB,53.5183647,-113.5028093,4,"Was really looking forward to dining here but was left a little underwhelmed with a part of my order to be honest. The service was good, wait time was a bit lengthy.

Loved the salmon sandwich. Only had good salmon sandwiches like that in Vancouver but this was better (my one complaint would be it had too much sauce) Garlic fingers was decent as well, however my fish tacos were so runny and soggy, I could barely enjoy the meal. I asked the server and was told it's because the slaw was freshly made. Not sure if that's a good reason. The fries were also cold,  overly salty and overdone.

I'm hoping the quality was a one off thing and I'm planning to return to another location and I'll try some other menu items and hopefully it will be a better experience.  Overall not a bad experience but it really didn't meet all my expectations."
Blowers & Grafton,Canadian (New),"10550 82 Ave NW Edmonton, AB T6E 2A4 Canada",AB,53.5183647,-113.5028093,3,"Blowers & Grafton on Whyte Avenue offers a culinary journey to the East Coast, but my recent visit was a mixed bag. The initial impression was marred by a long wait for seating and a less than warm welcome from the staff which extended to when we were ordering our drinks.

A significant issue was the restaurant's lack of cheese, a staple ingredient that resulted in a surprising number of unavailable menu items, including their pizzas, and nachos. Their dessert doughnuts as well as their cauliflower dish were also unavailable for order amoungst who knows what other dishes may have been subject to this fate. This was a considerable inconvenience and quite frankly, a bit absurd for a restaurant of this caliber.

However, the Fisherman's Feast was a redeeming factor, offering a delightful taste of the sea. The mussels, on the other hand, were let down by a sauce that leaned towards the bitter and sour side.

The staff's attitude improved over the course of the evening, and the bartender's offer of a $20 gift certificate to compensate for the food issues was a commendable gesture. However, the explanation for the shortages - a bicycle race - seemed a poor excuse for a restaurant that should anticipate and prepare for such events.

In conclusion, while Blowers & Grafton has potential, my experience was inconsistent. With improved preparation and customer service, it could truly shine as a beacon of East Coast cuisine in Edmonton."

What we ordered:
- Garlic Fingers: Perfect choice for appetizer and sharing. It is pizza dough with garlic butter and a generous amount of mozzarella cheese dipped with their signature sauce. Once you have a bite, you cannot stop😬
- Hali Cheesesteak Sandwich: Speechless just look how stuffed it is💯
- Sausage and Bacon Hash Bowl: Available on brunch menu. A filling dish with loads of flavors

One of the best sellers here is the mini lobster rolls, definitely have it the next time I go

Service is always great, never any complaints, however the food was mediocre. Paying $32 for chicken parmigiana, the breading to the chicken should not be soggy due to the large amount of sauce, which also made it hard to taste the mozzarella. For starters we ordered the Cesar salad and the maple sausage crostini. The meat on the crostini tasted heavily processed and the flavours of the maple and ricotta did not make sense to the palate. The bread was also extremely hard to bite. For dessert we got the tiramisu, which was a 5/5! Overall I found the quality of the food did not align with the price. The menu also seems a bit outdated. 3.5/5."

Visiting family in the area we called ahead to see if we needed a reservation and the gentleman on the phone informed us at the time no reservation was necessary but asked us what we needed and got a table ready for us (three adults, a 3yr old, and a baby). The Server Allyn was amazing, perfect balance of attentiveness without being pushy. The food was the best Italian I've had. Next time I'm in Edmonton Cafe Amore Bistro is on my list of ""must stops"". The portions are generous and the flavour mind-blowing."

They apologized a few times because it took them a few minutes to take our order. Our water tumblers were filled multiple times. I ordered Chicken Parmigiana. I chose linguine for my pasta choice. I have no complaint about the quantity. The pasta was nice and hot but the chicken was quite cold - at about room temperature. The chicken breast was overwhelmed with tomato sauce. I could hardly taste the Parmesan cheese. Because of the quality of the food, I’m opting for three stars; actually, it should be 3.5 stars. With the price of the food, I hoped that they would offer some buns. Many other restaurants do. This is something the establishment should consider."

The lighting, the decor, the music, the ambiance and the warm greeting at the door embraced me with a promise of a wonderful evening. The menu reads like a cornucopia of culinary sophistication, each item more tempting than the next. The wine list alone is enough reason to come here, and the cocktails are creative and tantalizing.

No problem getting a table- it is a very cozy atmosphere.

Love the Salted Cod fritters and the piri piri prawns always good.

We two had breakfast on a Tues. At 10:30.  We were the only customers!  The diner is in a commercial area and caters to the lunch trade.  One of us had the standard sausage, eggs (3), panfries, toast, and coffee.  The other had the farmers 3 egg omlette (includes bacon & panfries inside) with toast and coffee.  The food and service were great, with large portions. The coffee was good.  More people came in as lunchtime approached.   We did chat with the owner a bit -  who previously cooked at a well-known local German restaurant (now sadly closed).  It shows - since schnitzel and goulash are also on the menu!

The place itself is really nice and clean, and the staff is friendly. We tried quite a few dishes, but unfortunately, some were really salty and others were just flavorless. The Jamaica water was good, but the horchata tasted like milk and the dessert didn't taste good at all. It felt like it was really old and it was way too expensive for such a small portion. We also tried a torta, which was okay. The elote was good, but it was also pretty expensive. Overall, I would give this place 3 stars. It's a nice place to go for a drink, but I wouldn't recommend it for lunch or supper.

We attended their 1 year celebration and enjoyed the festivities.
We ordered so many different dishes that I can't remember it all LOL.
But the one that sticks out is the Mole Chicken and the chips and salsa.

El Mero Mero Taqueria,Mexican,"12223 156 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5V 1E6 Canada",AB,53.57559,-113.58976,3,"My wife and I recently decided to give El Mero Mero Taqueria a try since it was conveniently located nearby. We opted for the sampler, which allowed us to choose five different flavors of meat. Among them, the Al Pastor and Fish Tacos stood out as my personal favorites. The Elotes were pretty good but if you're used to Taber corn it'll be different from that sweet soft texture.

We visited this taqueria for lunch and my initial excitement was well-founded. The restaurant itself has a pleasant ambiance and is kept clean. The staff members were friendly, although slightly busy during our visit. It seemed like they were in the midst of preparing their lunch special or something similar.

While enjoying our meal, we also decided to try their churros. Unfortunately, the inside of the churros seemed slightly undercooked, as the batter was still chewy.

El Mero Mero Taqueria is a fantastic place to experience authentic tacos with a wide selection in Edmonton. The restaurant's environment is cool and unique, featuring art that adorns the ceilings and floors. Before finalizing my review, I would like to try a few more menu items to get a better sense of their overall offerings. Nevertheless, as a newcomer in town, it's definitely worth a visit."
El Mero Mero Taqueria,Mexican,"12223 156 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5V 1E6 Canada",AB,53.57559,-113.58976,5,"This is our new favourite Mexican restaurant in YEG! The atmosphere was welcoming, relaxed and fun - really cool artwork on the walls.  The service was fantastic, our drinks were never empty and everything was quick! The best part, the food! We started with gauc and chips…definitely the best of both I’ve had - I could have left just eating that and been happy.  Also started with the queso funido with chorizo, which was also fantastic…the cheese pull was top notch! We split the birria tacos and the pescado - both had beautiful presentations and out of this world flavours! I do have to pick favourites…the birria.  I could have drank that broth! Super tender and so flavourful - you guys take the cake in the city for the best! They had really tempting dessert options, but we were already stuffed, so that will be visit #2."

We got the Yellowfin Tuna and Beef Tartare. Normally Been Tartare's texture isn't my favourite, but it was surprisingly good. The fish however, was not. Although I love raw fish, the taste combination was not good, especially for $23. We left hungry and not even satisfied by the food. The service was okay."

Black Pearl is in a little hole in the wall on the vibrant 104 Street in Edmonton.  There are other restaurants in the city that can do up fancy dishes with sauces and with varying presentations. But for just fresh seafood on a plate, Black Pearl is head and shoulders above all other seafood establishments.  The food is extremely fresh and you can taste the quality.

The space is very hip.  It's very chic but also blends elements of an eatery you might find in the Maritimes. There are two floors to this space so don't let the small footprint from outside fool you.

The service is incredible. The servers are extremely helpful and kind.

One note... The food is VERY EXPENSIVE. But you pay for what you get. And to be privy to such incredible seafood on the prairies is very special warranting the prices.

Make sure you make a reservation!

The place has an adventurous and collectionist vibe proper of a pirate, it's simply fun just to be there. One can appreciate the amount of detail and care to create such timely scene yet they've also managed to make it look modern.
The place has a second floor for big reservations or special events, it gives them a lot of privacy.

Our waiter Tony did an amazing job creating cocktails for us upon request (non alcoholic) and he made us have a wonderful dinner experience all throughout. He noticed we were checking out the decorations and took the time to share with us the place is actually decorated with real ship items and ornaments. He was so nice and patient with us.

We had octopus, oysters, tea and crème brûlèe. They were beyond incredible and beautifully served.

I would totally recommend. I hope Tony and the chefs are appreciated amongst the staff as they were amazing.

Thank-you!"

A bit of a throwback menu and appearance but that's not why you go. Out of 7 of us, 6 had the smoked meat sandwich. I was the only one that changed it up a bit and had the club roll. The smoked meat guys all loved their choice but they also all wanted to see what was in my sandwich. Roast beef, smoked meat, turkey and salami. Best sandwich I've ever had. The service was great. The beer selection is a bit limited but it was a great price and a true pint in a nice big chilled beer glass. Definitely going back."

The burger wasn't anything special and the meat seems to be cooked weird and my girlfriend's sandwich wasn't the best.

However, we did order the charcuterie board which was really good and came with what I think was a dill cream cheese? I'd definitely order it again. We also ordered old fashioned which was decent as well.

Service was good and the staff was incredibly friendly, we will come back and try it again soon."

Highly recommend!

OEB Breakfast,Breakfast & Brunch,"10174 100A Street Edmonton, AB T5J 0H3 Canada",AB,53.5426187,-113.4925759,5,"This review is based off a visit on 05/03/2023 and again on 05/04/2023. (Also, it was brought to my attention I posted this review for the wrong OEB location. How lucky for Edmontonians that you have THREE OEBs to choose from!)

I live in Toronto, and unless you're willing to stand in line for HOURS on a weekend (or manage to go on a weekday), you cannot get into the OEB in Liberty Village. So believe me when I tell you I was thrilled to discover an OEB in Edmonton during a recent visit.

My experience was so good on visit number one, we visited again the very next day.

First of all, the restaurant styling and theme is impeccable. Truly a gorgeous space with a clearly defined brand identity.

Second, the service is amazing. On both occasions, we were greeted and seated promptly, and our servers on each visit were bubbly, friendly, knowledgable about the menu, and attentive without being overbearing.

I'm normally a ""sweets for breakfast"" kind of person, but I couldn't resist the idea of a breakfast carbonara. I was not disappointed with my choice. The gnocchi was perfectly plush, surrounded by hearty chunks of bacon, and topped with a gorgeously orange fresh egg yolk. Every bite was perfection, and I could have eaten three more servings.

On visit two, I reverted back to my old habits and ordered the French toast trifle. Another delicious choice, featuring two slices of thick brioche, topped with a tart lemon curd, fresh strawberries, and toasted meringues. No need to add syrup!

The only downside of my visit to OEB is that we didn't have time in our trip's schedule to visit a third time.

Overall:

Pros:
- Gorgeous and quaint restaurant with amazing decor and design choices
- Incredibly friendly and helpful staff
- Wide variety of choices from savoury to sweet to please all taste buds
- Fresh ingredients combined in creative ways

Cons:
- Paid street or parkade parking only"

We are from out of town and the reviews kept popping up every time we were searching for best places to eat in Edmonton.  We have been trying to come a number of times. We ended up going to the city centre Kelly ramsay in Edmonton. Food was absolutely stellar and on the healthy side for a breakfast place.  Service was quick and top knotch.  All the servers helped each other out.  Justin and Sydney were excellent.  All the staff were happy, positive, smiling and personable.  They kept us topped up with everything.  They use Umbria coffee roasters which is of superb quality.  And we are fairly picky with our food.  We almost always won't post negative reviews but will only post the best of the best!

Visiting Edmonton and spotted the reviews for this location so took a chance.

Party of two, we were greeted well as a walk in and promptly seated. The location was busy for a Saturday morning as to be expected and was well lit with refreshing colours and seating. Staff was very kind and friendly.

The food however was mediocre to gross. My partner ordered the ham with eggs, sourdough bread and potatoe wedges which came as ordered and was a typical ham and egg breakfast though at an elevated price. So it goes.

For myself I ordered the ""Gold Digga"" breakfast poutine which is made up of poached eggs, herb potatoes, Saint Cyrille curds, Berkshire roast pork, black truffles and brown butter hollandaise. To the staff's credit, I asked for my eggs soft and they confirmed that they would be runny. What I was not expecting once the meal arrived was firstly the smaller portion size and secondly that the mix of the egg yolks, whites, hollandaise sauce, oils and cheese would leave the bottom half of the bowl a symphonic mess of a soggy herb potatoe soup. This was contrasted with the overcooked Berkshire roast pork which more closely resembled last night's overcooked leftover steak cubed and refried for the next-day patron's. The seasoning was present but immediately overwhelmed by the soggy potatoe soup to be rendered pointless and the truffles were simply absent. All together the dish is worthy of a spot on Gordan Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and were it not for having spent time in the Army eating whatever we were told to eat, I'm sure I would have rejected this out of hand.

Regardless, the location was clean and the staff were great. Maybe we'll return in the future but I simply cannot recommend these ""breakfast poutines"" which appear to be constructed without care or attention to detail.

1 star for the breakfast poutine mess +1 star because the cooks knew how to cook the ham and eggs served to my partner along with the good staff and atmosphere."

Wagyu Beef Carpaccio (10/10): an explosion of flavors. Fresh, juicy, and super delicious, this plate is their best appetizer. The meat melts in your mouth. Fold it and put it on the fresh bread they serve to have a must-try bite. It's so good!

Ricotta Gnudi (10/10): the Basil Pesto Genovese is made to perfection. It is soft and buttery. The ingredients are so fresh and the quality is simply top of the line. The addition of Roasted Pine Nuts and Arugula is marvelous.

Agnolotti (10/10): It's so creamy and tasty. The truffle makes it super tasty. One of my favorite dishes. The portion is a bit small, but the taste is just amazing. I love it!

Chocolate Budino (10/10): A dense, soft, thin top crust, excuisit piece of brownie. I usually don't like super chocolaty desserts, but this changed my mind. It's so fulfilling that you want to just indulge in it. It's their number one dessert.

*Service*

The staff is super friendly and helpful. The food came fast and fresh.

The place is a bit cosy. Nevertheless, it's a perfect choice for a date, casual meeting, and/or business meeting. The ambiance is somehow calming. I love it!"

I ordered their full course meal.
- Their bread with duck fat and Ricotta cheese was mind-blowingly delicious. In my opinion a little too rich for an appetizer.
- Salad: Fresh, colorful and offered a variety of different textures. Very very light.
- Pastas: Fluffy gnocchi that was accompanied by a savory and earthy black truffle sauce. Was slightly disappointed with the texture of the meat balls and the overall flavor of their tomato sauce. The pastas were all somewhat salty (even for someone who likes their food salty).
- Fish: Grilled to perfection. Fresh, juicy, flaky and had a slight hint of smoke."

It's a legendary iconic spot in Edmonton that has stood the test of time. However, with so many new more innovative offerings in town, this spot is starting to age a little.

The rustic space is still quaint and has a great university vibe. The servers are amazingly positive and upbeat.

The food is good. It's no longer on par with the industry that is moving so much further forward in breakfast dining.  The chicken & waffles and the benny are decent.  However...good news...they still have the giant cinnamon roll on the menu that can serve a whole family.

Our server, Matt, knew when and when not to come by our table. They locally source most of their menu items! Beef tartare on sourdough and ahi tuna to start. Flavour explosions. They accommodated us by putting the avocado on the side for allergy reasons. We had the caviar plate next. Wow! Sustainably sourced and so delicious! Main courses were lamb and salmon with a side of pork belly. The salmon with the dill sauce paired perfectly and the rice side was such a great combo of citrus, tomato and leek. The lamb with meatballs was so tender with an incredible tomato jam that I have never tasted before! I need to buy that! The pork belly was cooked so well. Crisp and tender at the same time. For dessert, the vanilla panna cotta was a nice light finish. The chocolate cake was a bit harder than we expected while the mousse on top was a delicious crusted caramel. And we took home two macaroons! We had wines to go with every course and were not disappointed in choices recommended by Matt. Chef Scott came at the end to say hello and congratulate us on our anniversary. We had a nice chat learning about the restaurant. What a great fine dining experience! Highly recommended!"

The menu changes often (perhaps seasonally), and I was very happy to see they finally added their prices to the online menu. They also stopped charging a $10 fee for reservations. If that’s prevented you from visiting, as it has for me, now is the time! The dinner is incredible. I savoured every bite. The beef was cooked to perfection and just melted in my mouth. The dessert was equally as incredible. One shareable, two mains, two desserts, and two non alcoholic bevies was $145 before tip. Highly recommend, and of course it’s a stunning view of the legislature and river valley."

For how much I paid and how small amount of food I got, it should have been at least better than I can make at home.

I never order dessert, but I did at this place because I was still hungry after eating 2 strips of steak and 4 tablespoons of mashed potatoes. The dessert was straight up bad. Mousse on top of a ""brownie"" hockey puck. Sprinkled with a heinous amount of hard caramel pieces.

The mojito was good, the service not bad. Don't waste your time or money if you are considering this place to eat out."

Phenomenal dining experience from service to the food. The tasting menu is seasonal and changes based upon the availability of local produce/protein.

Definitely will be coming back to enjoy another tasting menu. Also on a side note, you can order regular tasting menu and vegetable tasting menu together (not one over the other).

I also appreciated the attention to detail on the presentation of the food. They also use local ceramic dinnerware, which looked amazing."

Although they specialize in Portuguese cuisine, the Spanish fare here was amazing. They even have jamon Iberico bellota and Galician octopus!

The service left nothing to be desired. Our server was very prompt and she was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and provided excellent recommendations. A real pleasure to have her as our server."
Sabor,Portuguese,"10220 103 Street Edmonton, AB T5J 4A1 Canada",AB,53.5435145,-113.4976116,4,"The restaurant is beautiful, the wait staff is attentive, there's multiple dining options ( tapas, on a limited menu) and sabor with a full menu. To start the bread and cheeses are amazing. The braised boar cheek 10/10 couldn't have done it better.

But when it came up to catch of the day, it seemed rather uninspired no sauce, my wifes salmon was undercooked. i also wasn't a huge fan of the lobster risotto it just tastes of tomato sauce. The lobster was also overcooked. It was kind of gross, to be honest. It looked rather unappetizing on the plate as well. The catch of the day was salmon and halibut together.

It made me really wish i had whoever was in charge of red meats cooking my mains that night, haha."

The Bedouins,Middle Eastern,"12832 137 Avenue NW Edmonton, AB T5L 4Y8 Canada",AB,53.6005654,-113.5428032,4,I tried this place a while back and their food was delicious. This time I tried chicken Tajeen which was good but not great. The veggies on it are delicious tho. Portions are really big. Loved the appetizers. Tea wasn’t free as opposed to what other reviews are suggesting
The Bedouins,Middle Eastern,"12832 137 Avenue NW Edmonton, AB T5L 4Y8 Canada",AB,53.6005654,-113.5428032,5,"We were recently in Edmonton exploring that city’s vibrant restaurant scene. We’re huge fans of North African and Eastern Mediterranean cuisine so The Bedouins was high on our list of places to visit. And we are so glad we did.

The food here is fabulous and priced very, very fairly. The vibe is casual and unpretentious, and the staff are friendly (even when they are run off their feet when it's busy).

We wanted to try lots of dishes so as usual we ordered far more food than we could eat at one sitting.

We ordered two appetizers: Batata Mbuttana (spiced, minced meat between two layers of fluffy mashed potato, breaded then fried), and; Buraik (think vegetarian deep fried spring roll). While the Buraik was very good, the Batata Mbuttana was outrageously delicious, especially when dipped in the creamy garlic sauce that accompanied the dish.

We were going to order the Mashweeya Dip (essentially a roasted veggie tapenade), and the Bedouin Lamb Soup, but our server informed us that small orders of each were included with our mains so we didn’t have to order separately. Very cool!

As for the mains, we ordered Chicken Tajeen and Lamb Haneeth. Both were outstanding.

The Tajeen was a half-chicken (and not a small bird either) that had clearly been marinated in a medley of spices then baked to perfection. It was served on a generous bed of perfectly cooked yellow rice. Delicious!

The Lamb Haneeth is advertised as roasted lamb in a mix of herbs, creating a dish “you have never seen or tasted before” - and they’re right. We love lamb and order it whenever the opportunity presents itself, so we’re picky. This was some of the best lamb dishes we’ve ever had. Complex, rich and layered flavours accent a generous portion of melt-in-your-mouth tender lamb. Seriously, if you like lamb this is a must-order dish.

As for the accompanying small plates, the lamb and pasta soup was a revelation, and the lentil soup was almost as good. And the small plate of Mashweeya Dip & Hummus (served with a scrumptious warm bread) was a creamy taste delight. Heck, even the simple green salads were served up with a very tasty herbed olive oil dressing - so good!

Oh, and if you like a nice strong black tea infused with fresh mint leaves order up a pot - it’s so delicious!

All this for $95 (tax and generous gratuity included). Great value considering the quality and the fact that our boxed leftovers provided breakfast and a light lunch the next day.

Highly recommended!"
The Bedouins,Middle Eastern,"12832 137 Avenue NW Edmonton, AB T5L 4Y8 Canada",AB,53.6005654,-113.5428032,5,Came for dinner and left satisfied. We ordered the combo dinner for our table of 5 adults. The lamb and chicken dishes accompanying the combo were delicious. More than enough food for us and to be honest most likely would have fed up to 6. In addition to the fantastic food was the great service of the staff. The staff was prompt and checked to make sure everything was satisfactory. They even found time to crack a joke and put a smile on everyone's faces. The atmosphere was relaxed and definitely a place I would recommend to have a nice homestyle meal. I will definitely be back!
The Bedouins,Middle Eastern,"12832 137 Avenue NW Edmonton, AB T5L 4Y8 Canada",AB,53.6005654,-113.5428032,5,"The staff were incredibly friendly and we were given so much food along with our meals! The bread was freshly made and so delicious and the soup that was given was perfect. I got the shawarma plate and it had a lot of food, I even had enough for a whole lunch the next day, but it was absolutely delicious. Turkish coffee is also worth a try!"

The food was good and came out quickly. Service is probably the best part. Aziz was our waiter and he made sure we were all taken care of. He was very kind and nice.

Delicious bread and hummus. The meals are very large portions, most people in our party couldn't finish their meals.

Will definitely come back again!"
Tokiwa Ramen,Ramen,"11978 104 Avenue Edmonton, AB T5K 0T3 Canada",AB,53.5474099,-113.5279006,5,"Tokiwa Ramen meets local expectations & is a must for Ramen lovers or first-time eaters.

My friend suggested this location after I mentioned I was craving some Ramen.

WOW! This place was fantastic. I have to apologize for the photos, because the food looked so good I had to dig-in right away.

Fresh ingredients, awesome customer service, delicious broth. This place lives up to the expectations!

During rush hour, just be prepared to wait in line.

Check out Tokiwa Ramen if you're in Edmonton, you will not regret it!"
Tokiwa Ramen,Ramen,"11978 104 Avenue Edmonton, AB T5K 0T3 Canada",AB,53.5474099,-113.5279006,5,"Been trying to come to this place so many times, either they ran out of soup or it was just a crazy line up! Finally made it and certainly worth it. Waited 20 minutes in line. We had the Tokyo Tonkotsu and the Black Garlic ramen. So delicious! That broth was so flavourful. Also had the Bou Gyoza... Nice and crispy crunch to it and a different texture than the traditional Gyoza. Wish there were more than 4 pieces cause I could have had that all to myself. Service was good, they were busy so things moved quickly. We got our drinks and food promptly. There was still even a line up after 2pm. Overall, great place, highly recommended!"
Tokiwa Ramen,Ramen,"11978 104 Avenue Edmonton, AB T5K 0T3 Canada",AB,53.5474099,-113.5279006,5,"A great addition to Edmonton, honestly the best ramen I’ve ever eaten at a restaurant. There are a variety of toppings and great broth flavours to choose from, I have been many times and every time it has been delicious! Beautiful presentation, and great noodles too, I just can’t say enough! The staff are friendly, it is a very small dinning space but that just adds to its appeal. You walk in, and get sat right away unless it’s busy (then it’s usually still only 15mins wait), the menus are QR codes on all of the tables, and you get your food super quick after ordering so a great place for lunch if you don’t have too much time. Definitely a favourite place of mine to go to eat, would recommend to anyone who likes soups. Very spicy to non-spicy options, all taste delicious!"
Tokiwa Ramen,Ramen,"11978 104 Avenue Edmonton, AB T5K 0T3 Canada",AB,53.5474099,-113.5279006,4,"Here on a weekday around 1pm. It was busy, 15-20min wait. There were signs and the staff directed as well when it comes to wait times. Service was quick. The only thing is we didn't get a chance to chat and stay longer given that it was continuously busy and the tables were so close to each other. It is worth the wait when it comes to their food. Delicious Ramen, for sure!"
Tokiwa Ramen,Ramen,"11978 104 Avenue Edmonton, AB T5K 0T3 Canada",AB,53.5474099,-113.5279006,4,"Overall, the noodles are good but soup seems lacking. Definitely had interesting topping choices, no bamboo shoots but shoyu black fungus. The bowls are full of taste but lacking ""aroma.""
Black garlic tonkotsu - shoyu tare is heavy on shiitake mushroom taste and umami, has a roasted flavor from the black garlic oil
Yuzu shio chicken - super strong yuzu taste from the oil on top, light clear broth but not as good as other yuzu shio chicken soup ramen that I have had.
Small chicken rice bowl - standard, a bit on the sweet-umami side from the sauce, generous amount of green onion garnish
The table condiments include pickled chili sauce/oil and rice vinegar"

Not sure if they changed the menu or the chefs but everything we ordered this time tasted great. The portions were justifiable. The prices were not too expensive considering the inflation these days. Loved the traditional decor and calm ambiance. It was a busy rush hour and we didnt have a reservation. We had to be at the bar but didnt mind it since there was only two of us. We got to see the chefs make the food in live time. Will definitely visit again

Downtown has a super vibe with the post work crowd raising the bar on the cool factor.

Our hostess was a little inauthentic.  Too put on.  But the service was service-able."
JOEY Bell Tower,Canadian (New),"10310-101 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5J 4X1 Canada",AB,53.5451088,-113.4941745,3,"Great food with reasonable pricing. Most likely going to have to pay for parking if you drive here as it's in the ice district and parking is hard to come by but great vibes for a dinner out with friends.
Our waitress seemed very inexperienced though and didn't remember parts of our order. Is affogato not something Joey offers? I asked for one and explained what it was to our waitress but she served it already poured and was cold when I received it. I also didn't get a spoon and our waitress left before I had time to notice and didn't come back for a long time. I ended up eating the ice cream with the chopsticks served at the table...... My friend ordered one after me and the espresso came out 5+ minutes after the ice cream was served (again without a spoon even though I specifically asked for one this time).
If you are unsure what a customer is asking for please ask a more experienced staff member or Google it OR just say we can't make it. That was so ridiculous and unprofessional to me and it seemed like the waitress just didn't care.
I do think Joey's is a good place though and would go back.... I'm assuming most staff members are more present and professional."

We were served so poorly and not only it made us feel unwelcome and by the time our food came the pasta to their so called chicken parmigiana was hard. The food was unappetizing.

It has a nice diner retro vibe, but the food is probably the best food I've had in a long time. I've had jambalaya before and I thought I didn't like it, until I came here. PORTIONS are huge and worth every penny, and the flavours are honestly amazing. Come eat here if you're reading this."

Firstly, I would recommend making a reservation if it's the weekend, as it can get very busy.

We had ordered the crab cake po'boy and breakfast po'boy and they were both absolutely fantastic. The crab cakes had a fantastic flavor and good coating, the bread didn't get soggy at all, and the Andouille sausage was very flavorful in the breakfast po'boy.

The service was also great and all the servers were very kind. Overall, this was a 10/10 experience and I will absolutely be coming back the next opportunity I have"

However, they were able to rectify the situation, and I was satisfied with the resolution. In terms of pricing, they're slightly more expensive than similar grade hotels.

It's definitely worth visiting if you're staying at the Westin, especially since the winter temperatures here are unreasonably cold."

Cappuccino was great and the earl grey tea in the London fog was definitely a star. We had the breakfast sandwich with potatoes and pulled pork sandwich. Everything was delicious and home style. The buns were soft and flaky, paired really well with the fillings. 5/5 stars experience!"

Last couple of orders the eggs were overcooked, almost hard-boiled. So sad... But coffee is still good and the staff are friendly. It's a nice and cozy dog-friendly place, I really enjoy being here. Hope they can make that amazing yolk-running eggs again!"

The food quality is fantastic, portions are great, and the staff are very friendly. It’s located in a quiet neighborhood which adds to its charm, but because of the location parking might be limited. Definitely check this place out if you’re ever in town."

La Patrona,Mexican,"2 Athabascan Avenue Unit 8 Sherwood Park, AB T8A 4E3 Canada",AB,53.5368579,-113.3209739,5,"Nice place with great feel. We came in on Canada Day late afternoon so it was starting to get busy but not quite yet. They gave us a lot of time before starting to serve the appetizer. The nachos was so delicious though. It did not have any cheese on top, but was super flavourful. I do prefer it without cheese despite being a cheese lover because sometimes restaurants put too much cheese on top and ignoring other ingredients also bring flavours to this dish. We also had the Suadero (brisket) and Al Pastor (pork) taco. The brisket was a bit dry to my taste but the Al Pastor was both flavourful and refreshing because of the pineapple bits on top. I also personally liked the rice better than the bean paste as it again can be a bit dry on its own. Maybe I don’t know the proper way to eat it. Churros with whipped cream was also good. Overall a good experience and great food."

I had the pork tacos and my hubby had the brisket.  Both very delicious.  We also started with the homemade chips with guacamole and fresh salsa. Everything was very fresh and well seasoned. Our  server was very good and helpful with picking menu items. We tried the 3 milk cake. It tasted good but you have to like soggy cake. The custard dessert was tasty but it was quite firm . Not bad just not like a brule. We will be back to try new things

All of their dishes are very creatively done and extremely tasty.  You'll recognize many of the favorites you traditionally get at Vietnamese restaurants including the soups and rice/vermicelli dishes. Except they add that extra flair and the dishes are fresh and inventive.

The space is very gorgeous with a stunning bar and their trademark giant pink tree overhanging the space.

The service is very good as well.

The staff are amasing and all hard working and polite. very kid friendly and i saw 4 tonight. The place is hidden around a corner with a visible banner out the front and a rotating sign out the very front of the mall. Love the place and have been there almost 10 times so far. Love the food. I usually order something from the feature menu or the burger. The potato skins were delicious and so was the seafood chowder.
Will continue to visit this place as it is close and a wonderful little gem of a restraunt."

We were very happy about the menu our server Rick recommended and services he provided. I am pregnant and wanted to have some nice virgin cocktail other than mojito and he offered sangria that is substituted with pomegranate juice and oh boy it was delicious!!
Also, all the food we ordered were delicious. You must try their mushroom pizza. The taste of the fresh ingredients with a touch of truffle oil was great. The pate and halibut fish cake were also great.
They have a nicely set up patio that we want to try next time. We originally went there to sit in their patio but we decided to stay inside since the inside set up was also very romantic and came with more comfy chairs."

The chicken was as juicy and tender as ever but the coating was [insert chef’s kiss emoji here].  My appetite was more than satisfied and so was that of the other fried chicken lovers that I brought the extra 10 pieces home for.

July 2023: Got the curry chicken rice bowl. It was okay, I wasn't really blown away by the flavours, and likely wouldn't get it again. There was a BOGO on bubble teas, so I got a strawberry Panna cotta with 30% sugar (definitely not sweet enough, and I don't like really sweet drinks) and the salted egg yolk milk tea (very unique flavours!)

I love Dagu Rice Noodle. They have a lot of great soup dishes and sides. If you go there, you know you'll be full when you leave.

When they had the offer for a VIP card, I knew I had to get it, and it was a good call for sure.

Their prices are very good for what you get, and on Mondays, they have $1 skewers which is pretty awesome!

Their soups are very flavourful and they don't skimp out on the ingredients. There's also unlimited noodles, so you can eat to your hearts content!

Overall, love Dagu and I usually think about coming back whenever I'm downtown"

Ordered tomato soup based noodles soup. It was delicious, the tomato soup based is very thick and rich. There are a lot of spices and tomatoes in the soup, has the right flavour.

Service was not attentive, I had to wait a while before they seated even there’s no one waiting in line and less than 5 tables with 3 servers."

Not only does Dagu Rice Noodle offer unique noodle dishes not found in many other stores in Edmonton, but the consistency and quality of the noodles, and the flavour of the broth is unmatched! It’s very fun to come with family and friends and spend time dipping the different ingredients in the hot stone bowl.

Other items on the menu I would definitely recommend are the salted egg bubble tea (I know- but TRUST ME it will blow your mind) and the fried chicken.

The staff are also very friendly, so I have become a repeat customer!"

Mango sunrise is my favourite drink. I can have it everyday. All of their drinks are between $6-$8

Check out uber eats as they offer discounts often."
Dagu Rice Noodle,Noodles,"10408 Jasper Avenue Edmonton, AB T5J 1Z3 Canada",AB,53.5412149,-113.4995711,5,"We've been here a few times and I'm glad the food is still very good but service seems to have come down quite a bit. It took a long time to get the food and it was always very difficult to get the waitresses attention.

Aside from the service issue we started with the pigs feet which was delicious. Personally this is not a dish I enjoy due to the many bones but it was very authentic to the real stuff in China and the Sichuan pepper flavour was spot on. Definitely a great choice if looking for the real deal!

For the noodles I had the tomato crossing the bridge which was delicious. It's not spicy at all but the flavour of the booth is amazing. All of the ""crossing the bridge"" noodles come with a side tray of vegetables and if you get the beef slices or other meats they come on the tray like in a hot pot. I get the meatballs though instead which are really nice and they come directly in the soup. The other soup we had was the fish one which again the soup was amazing.

The noodles are technically all you can eat but the bowls are so large you don't really need a second bowl of noodles and they don't actually taste like anything. For us it's all about the broths. Their bubble teas are also very good but take quite a while to be made. So overall it's worth it just don't go if in a rush!"

The service was excellent and prompt and the food came quite quickly. I thoroughly enjoyed the takoyaki and would happily have it again as an appetizer. The tonkotsu ramen was unreal. The broth was super flavourful and unlike anything I have ever had before. The pork was delicious and the entire dish was filling and delicious. I am tempted to try something else on my next visit but the tonkotsu ramen was just so good. They also gave us free mango pudding on the house which was also excellent. I highly recommend coming here.

The Tonkotsu Ramen and Lobster blew my mind. Although for the Lobster Roll you have to pay a lil extra but I didn't mind. The jaw-dropping dish that had me salavating from first bite was the Toro Sashimi. Melts in your mouth foodgasm!

The staff went beyond as well. We came around 1:30 in the afternoon, a little bit close to their closing time around 2:30 but I wasdesperate to try it out. Once we were done they complimented us with a free dessert. We were very satisfied and relaxed we didn't even notice that we over stayed waaaay past 2:30 but they didn't rush us whatsoever. It was our bad but they didn't even bat an eyelash. I will be coming back here but hopefully I won't over stay as I feel bad for the staff that had to do overtime.

Of course, who can suggest the best food to try but  my Italian friends themselves. So we had the Arancini Siciliano as appetizer, the Italian rice balls was cooked in perfection! Crispy outside and so yummy inside with or without the dip. Then came the Ravioli con Aragosta I ordered. Man, I was in love at first sight! Just the way the ravioli looks, my eyes already told me it's delicious. The pasta is stuffed and cut neatly and looked very fresh. And as I taste it, wow, my eyes didn't lie to me! Al dente as it should be, the  pasta didn't overpower the umaminess of the lobster. The sauce has the lobster juice that makes it heavenly. Mmmm!
My friends had the Duck Confit Gnocchi and Bresaola & Arugula Pizza and they said it was great too! I had a bite each, mmmm, yeah it was yummy too but I'm proud to review my ravioli. Maybe next time I come back and really have the gnocchi and pizza for myself! We ordered the tiramisu for dessert, it was really good but it's not like the traditional tiramisu we know and my friends make.
I'm going to visit Italy in Sept and would be looking for these dishes as well."

The only downside is their waitresses are so unprofessional. They always make mistakes taking our orders. One time they spilled half of the soup out when they were packing up noodles. Another time they mixed up our pack-to-go with someone else's. We didn't check until we got home so of course we ended up throwing everything away.
It is really frustrating after a couple times. Hopefully they can hire someone more reliable."

None of us have been there before, but we heard it was very good and that it's quite small inside, so we made reservations. The restaurant has 6 tables inside and was very clean and tidy. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly and offered up some suggestions for dishes to try.

We started off with some spring rolls, which were quite delicious and perfectly cooked (there were 5 spring rolls in total). Two of us ordered the Pad Thai and the other ordered the Chicken Cashew Nut. We all enjoyed our meals, but also commented that it wasn't anything special. I know I've had better Pad Thai elsewhere, but this was still very delicious.

I'd definitely return again to try some of their other dishes, like either the Thai Green Curry or the Thai Red Curry with their coconut rice, as well as the Zap wings which also sounded interesting."

The peanut ginger dressing was so good. My friends ordered from there lunch menu and everyone liked there food. I highly recommend their coconut rice.
One more thing if you planning to go there for lunch don’t be surprised by long wait ad the place is small and is super packed."

It had a nice kick and the basted eggs were perfectly cooked. I highly recommend if you like a spicy dish. My wife had Chorizo Verde bowl which she  loved. They create amazing flavours using fresh locally sourced ingredients. I should also mention that the service was top notch.  We’ll definitely be back to try more of the menu items!

Additionally, the prices were really good for the quality of food that we received!"

Generous portions and lots of flavour. Will definitely come back."

This super cool ambient upscale dining spot is attached to the Art Gallery. Lots of concrete in the infrastructure and beautiful paintings adorn the walls.

We have been here on both New Years for brunch and this past weekend for dinner. Their food is contemporary fusion with some Asian flair.  It's become one of our faves in YEG and we have a big list of establishments in town.  The food is creative, fresh and the room has such a good mood.

Make a visit. You won't regret it.

Addendum: Have dropped the food rating to a four star. The quality seems to have changed somewhat in recent months with the departure of their precious chef. Nevertheless...still worth a visit."

Wasnt a hand held which took me by surprise but the flavour was incredible. I can honestly say this was one of the best meals of my life. The flavour combination was perfectly balanced! The menu and selection is not only organic and has lots of vegan options but is also really good. Made it hard to choose what to eat.
Highly recommend!
Great price for the quality you get, the proportions are perfect. Musics good here to. Staff was incredible too."
OEB Breakfast,Breakfast & Brunch,"10174 100A Street Edmonton, AB T5J 0H3 Canada",AB,53.5426187,-113.4925759,5,"This review is based off a visit on 05/03/2023 and again on 05/04/2023. (Also, it was brought to my attention I posted this review for the wrong OEB location. How lucky for Edmontonians that you have THREE OEBs to choose from!)

I live in Toronto, and unless you're willing to stand in line for HOURS on a weekend (or manage to go on a weekday), you cannot get into the OEB in Liberty Village. So believe me when I tell you I was thrilled to discover an OEB in Edmonton during a recent visit.

My experience was so good on visit number one, we visited again the very next day.

First of all, the restaurant styling and theme is impeccable. Truly a gorgeous space with a clearly defined brand identity.

Second, the service is amazing. On both occasions, we were greeted and seated promptly, and our servers on each visit were bubbly, friendly, knowledgable about the menu, and attentive without being overbearing.

I'm normally a ""sweets for breakfast"" kind of person, but I couldn't resist the idea of a breakfast carbonara. I was not disappointed with my choice. The gnocchi was perfectly plush, surrounded by hearty chunks of bacon, and topped with a gorgeously orange fresh egg yolk. Every bite was perfection, and I could have eaten three more servings.

On visit two, I reverted back to my old habits and ordered the French toast trifle. Another delicious choice, featuring two slices of thick brioche, topped with a tart lemon curd, fresh strawberries, and toasted meringues. No need to add syrup!

The only downside of my visit to OEB is that we didn't have time in our trip's schedule to visit a third time.

Overall:

Pros:
- Gorgeous and quaint restaurant with amazing decor and design choices
- Incredibly friendly and helpful staff
- Wide variety of choices from savoury to sweet to please all taste buds
- Fresh ingredients combined in creative ways

Cons:
- Paid street or parkade parking only"

We are from out of town and the reviews kept popping up every time we were searching for best places to eat in Edmonton.  We have been trying to come a number of times. We ended up going to the city centre Kelly ramsay in Edmonton. Food was absolutely stellar and on the healthy side for a breakfast place.  Service was quick and top knotch.  All the servers helped each other out.  Justin and Sydney were excellent.  All the staff were happy, positive, smiling and personable.  They kept us topped up with everything.  They use Umbria coffee roasters which is of superb quality.  And we are fairly picky with our food.  We almost always won't post negative reviews but will only post the best of the best! Thank you OEB staff.  We will be back. Our new go to breakfast place in the city"

My blue crab benny was really good, but it was quite fishy tasting, so beware if you don't like strong fishy flavors. It's a bit too much for me personally. Would definitely go back to try other items on the menu."
OEB Breakfast,Breakfast & Brunch,"10174 100A Street Edmonton, AB T5J 0H3 Canada",AB,53.5426187,-113.4925759,2,"AVOID.

Visiting Edmonton and spotted the reviews for this location so took a chance.

Party of two, we were greeted well as a walk in and promptly seated. The location was busy for a Saturday morning as to be expected and was well lit with refreshing colours and seating. Staff was very kind and friendly.

The food however was mediocre to gross. My partner ordered the ham with eggs, sourdough bread and potatoe wedges which came as ordered and was a typical ham and egg breakfast though at an elevated price. So it goes.

For myself I ordered the ""Gold Digga"" breakfast poutine which is made up of poached eggs, herb potatoes, Saint Cyrille curds, Berkshire roast pork, black truffles and brown butter hollandaise. To the staff's credit, I asked for my eggs soft and they confirmed that they would be runny. What I was not expecting once the meal arrived was firstly the smaller portion size and secondly that the mix of the egg yolks, whites, hollandaise sauce, oils and cheese would leave the bottom half of the bowl a symphonic mess of a soggy herb potatoe soup. This was contrasted with the overcooked Berkshire roast pork which more closely resembled last night's overcooked leftover steak cubed and refried for the next-day patron's. The seasoning was present but immediately overwhelmed by the soggy potatoe soup to be rendered pointless and the truffles were simply absent. All together the dish is worthy of a spot on Gordan Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and were it not for having spent time in the Army eating whatever we were told to eat, I'm sure I would have rejected this out of hand.

Regardless, the location was clean and the staff were great. Maybe we'll return in the future but I simply cannot recommend these ""breakfast poutines"" which appear to be constructed without care or attention to detail.

1 star for the breakfast poutine mess +1 star because the cooks knew how to cook the ham and eggs served to my partner along with the good staff and atmosphere."

We felt his love for his job. We were so impressed by the food that we ordered two desserts for two of us (we typically order one and share). The best sticky toffee pudding I have ever had!"

We were able to substitute for vegetarian friendly options and also had the option of subbing marinara for alfredo sauce. Shout out to Emily, our server, who was really pleasant and was able to make recommendations from the menu. They didn't disappoint. Excellent customer service.
I asked for extra seasoning on my salmon but it really wasn't needed as it was quite tasty as is.
Portion size was perfect.

N.B Free dessert if you're celebrating a birthday :)"

The food was good. The portions were large. I thought the butter chicken was slightly bland but it could have been due to the other items I ate. The salad was good and so was the naan. Definitely worth the 9.99 plus tax for 3 items. Will eat here again next time I'm in Edmonton.

Community Taps + Pizza,Pizza,"8232 Gateway Boulevard NW Edmonton, AB T6E 4B2 Canada",AB,53.5188411,-113.4955137,5,"Great pizza and a retro industrial dining environment.

Community has some great New York-style pizza, perhaps one of the better New York-style pizzas in town. This pizza has a great Rossa sauce, complemented by the crisp flavourful crust. Pizza tastes best when eaten folded and warm. The only downside Of this pizza was the grease. However, this is likely due to all the pepperoni on the pizza, and I will say it is less greasy than other pizzas of this type in the area.

The atmosphere of this restaurant is very relaxing and left me craving a craft beer (which they offer a wide selection of).

Pizza is a solid 4/5, which is quite good!"
Community Taps + Pizza,Pizza,"8232 Gateway Boulevard NW Edmonton, AB T6E 4B2 Canada",AB,53.5188411,-113.4955137,5,Great pizza and nice service. My drink got knocked over they replaced it free of charge. Food service was slow the night we were there but this sounded like it was the exception and not the norm. The atmosphere and food you get definitely made up for it though! Great place to have a large group.

The New York style pizza was lovely, but the garlic bites are DIVINE. Like, I may never have eaten a bite more perfect in my life. The service was great too - very patient despite my questions, and they were great about my nut/ shellfish allergy.

Absolutely a must try if you're in the area. We were told The Next Act was the restaurant to beat (don't get me wrong, their burger was good), but I'd say that Community beats them cleanly!"
Misoya,Ramen,"10146 104 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5J 1A7 Canada",AB,53.542068,-113.499477,4,"The place itself looked so nice and clean, it has a great vibe to the interior. For the food i’m giving it a 4 star as there was a bit of an off smell to the pork on the ramen I ordered, which was Gold Kome Ramen but the broth was good and the size was big for $13.75! 2 of my friends ordered Deluxe Ramen and yea they were huge we all did take out on our ramens.
We also had starters which was the sweet potato fries, I highly recommend this one. It was crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside and tasted great with the mild spicy sauce. We had Chicken Karaage as well, there was 7 small-ish sized pieces for around $10, it was pretty tasty but a bit pricey for the size and amount.
Now on to the service I would give it a 4 because we ordered at 4:00pm and got our food at 4:45 so it was quite a long wait for 5 Ramens. I gotta say they were busy preparing Online orders though so maybe that’s why it took long to get our food.
All in all I would come back to this place, super yummy starters and huge bowls for Ramen!"
Misoya,Ramen,"10146 104 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5J 1A7 Canada",AB,53.542068,-113.499477,5,Great Japanese restaurant. Ramen tasted great. Broth was on point and noodles not mushy. Friendly service. Yakitori tasted amazing. Lots of stuff to choose on menu. Decent and clean interior. Would come back when in area. Highly recommend. Cheers
Misoya,Ramen,"10146 104 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5J 1A7 Canada",AB,53.542068,-113.499477,5,"I got the vegetarian options last night. Veg gold kome miso ramen, agedashi tofu, mushroom skewer, miso egg, and kimchi. My most favourite dish was the mushroom skewer and it is also very inexpensive! The flavours are so great. Followed by the ramen and sides. The agedashi tofu was a bit bland for my liking, however it was light and enjoyable nevertheless. I really liked the service and the ambiance, and will definitely be a returning customer!"
Misoya,Ramen,"10146 104 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5J 1A7 Canada",AB,53.542068,-113.499477,5,"Service is great, took a little while but it didn't disappoint so it was worth. Busy on lunch and I'm sure dinner service will be as well.. One of the best in Edmonton. Won't be disappointed.

An updated review: Misoya Ramen is a fantastic restaurant with great ramen dishes, a pleasant atmosphere, and excellent service.

It's always a good sign when a restaurant has standout dishes, and in this case, Misoya Ramen's silver shiro ramen is particularly noteworthy. Additionally, having a clean restaurant with nice decor can contribute to an enjoyable dining experience.

Perhaps one of the most important aspects of any dining experience is the service, and Misoya Ramen excels in this area. Friendly servers make the experience great and you can take your coworker or your wife for for a lunch date as the place is gorgeous. It makes a big difference in the overall experience of dining at a restaurant.

TLDR; Overall, Misoya Ramen is a great option for anyone looking for delicious ramen in a pleasant atmosphere with excellent service. Its probably close to authentic as I can't say since I've never been to Japan but I'm sure the flavors are spot on comparable."
Misoya,Ramen,"10146 104 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5J 1A7 Canada",AB,53.542068,-113.499477,5,"This place turned out to be a great surprise. Edmonton doesn't have many places for good ramen, so I never thought of giving this place a try. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. Most ramen places only give you 2 pieces of cha siu and call it a day. My bowl has 3 and they were all thick cut. The tonkatsu ramen has good flavor. It is probably on the pricier side for ramen, but I would say it is well worth the small premium."

Absolutely amazing!! Michelle was our server she was kind friendly and helpful! I ordered the avocado toast with a green smoothie and an egg on top and side of bacon.

The restaurant's enchanting decor and panoramic views overlooking the river valley made me feel like I was in a different country. It was a visual feast for the eyes, setting the stage for an extraordinary dining experience.

The beef was beyond compare, and the buttermilk mashed potatoes were like a stroke of culinary magic. The creamy, fluffy texture and rich, buttery flavor were a perfect complement to the exquisite beef. It was a combination that danced harmoniously on my palate, leaving me in awe of the incredible flavors.

The attention to detail and the use of high-quality ingredients were evident in every aspect of the meal. The presentation was impeccable, and the flavors were perfectly balanced. The talented chefs at The Harvest Room truly know how to create a memorable culinary experience.

Adding to the overall allure, the attentive and friendly staff provided exceptional service throughout the evening. They were knowledgeable, accommodating, and ensured that every need was met, enhancing the overall enjoyment of the dining experience.

In conclusion, The Harvest Room is a shining  gem that offers an extraordinary blend of sensational cuisine and a mesmerizing ambiance.

The restaurant was cozy and romantic with a unique selection of cocktails and menu options.

We sat on the outdoor patio for brunch and it had an incredible view of the city. The servers were so friendly and attentive, even as the patio filled up during our visit. After we ate, we were able to walk around the gardens and enjoy the gorgeous tropical flowers/plants, breathtaking views, and historical charm.

Thank you to the staff at the Harvest Room — You made our stay so special!"

It was the first time checking it out & was pleasantly surprised by how well executed everything was. The concepts & flavours were very simple but the elegance in the simplicity it was sells this place. The service was great, the vibe was cozy European chic & the food was classic. I almost felt like I was eating on the set of Sound of Music haha. Overall very enjoyable experience. Will definitely be coming back for a lunch to try some of their cold plates next time!"
Bistro Praha,Modern European,"10117 101 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5J 0T4 Canada",AB,53.5413289,-113.4934524,5,"Nice and cozy restaurant with some good Central European food. We ordered the Escargot, steak tartare and goulash to start. The Escargot was baked in a dish with garlic and oil and served with some toasted bread. The texture was a little soft but the flavour was good! The goulash was served with some bread dumplings and a lot of tender braised beef. It could have used a little more salt but the meat was quite soft and easy to eat. The steak tartare was really good, we ordered a large portion and it came with enough to easily share between 4 people. The toast was incredibly crispy and had a nice subtle nutty flavour to it. The steak itself was soft and paired very nicely with the bread. I would definitely recommend the steak tartare.

For our mains, we each ordered a schnitzel. I had the Cordon Bleu schnitzel which came out piping hot with a side of potato salad. The schnitzel was super thin and had a lot of melted cheese oozing out of it when I cut into it. The schnitzel was fried perfectly and came out as a nice even golden brown and also came out pretty light with very little oil sticking to the breading. Overall a pretty good schnitzel, 8/10.

For dessert, I had an apple strudel with whipped cream and vanilla ice cream. The strudel came out hot and flaky. The strudel itself was not too sweet and was really good when paired with the   light and airy whipped cream. You can't go wrong with ice cream on the side either.

I would definitely come back for sure."
Bistro Praha,Modern European,"10117 101 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5J 0T4 Canada",AB,53.5413289,-113.4934524,3,"Great food. The schnitzel was delicious as was the salad and potatoes. However the service was a bit disappointing considering the restaurant's reputation.

My server didn't check on me at all during my meal or offer to refill my water and seemed more interested in chatting with one of their regular customers. Considering that the restaurant was mostly empty and I paid almost $30 for an entree, this was kind of surprising."

The place was packed with a long wait time.  We decided to do a take-out.  The service was friendly and very accommodating.  The order was ready in 15 minutes, despite how busy their kitchen was.  The food was perfectly prepared and very delicious.  We will definitely visit Bistro Praha soon, but certainly with a reservation in advance."

We were there with a group of 14 people and they were very patient with splitting the bill and all of us ordering and they kept all of our orders straight which was impressive. The food also came out ridiculously fast which was fantastic. Even the atmosphere was great. We of course were a fairly loud and excited group as this was a pre wedding bridal party celebration and it was fun being a small space with different people who were also super positive and interacting with our group through our dinner in a positive way.
Calle Mexico,Mexican,"11127 107th Avenue Edmonton, AB T5H 0X9 Canada",AB,53.551208,-113.513401,4,"Went in for a quick meal and was not disappointed at all and warrants more visits in the future! The staff were just lovely! My friend and I tried the beef torta with the chicken tortilla soup, some horchatas, and churros to go! I really liked the salsa station i’m a fan of anything spicy so when they had some very spicy roasted habanero and some guacamole I already knew it was going to be good! The beef in the torta was perfectly marinated and seasoned. And the price per portion for the torta and the soup was good, worth it for sure as you get portions that are large in my opinion. I have a rule to always get tortilla soup if its on a Mexican restaurant’s menu and this was no exception! Don’t skip on the SOUP! It was really good! The horchatas were good as well! I was hoping the churros would be good but it was just ok, definitely needs the caramel sauce as it doesn’t stand on its own. I found parking on the street but be mindful that this might be a challenge if its busy. Overall, I would recommend this place for anyone looking for some good mexican food!"

Our party also had barbacoa, chicken, and steak tacos - all were a hit. The horchata is one of the reasons we keep coming back. Nobody spent more than $20 for their meal here, and we all left full. Get there early in the day if you want any of the home made desserts. They can sell out quickly sometimes."

The Cajun House,Cajun/Creole,"7 Saint Anne Street St. Albert, AB T8N 2X4 Canada",AB,53.6354601,-113.6257158,5,One of my favorite places to go to for any occasion. Good food that’s always made fresh with the right amount of flavors to satisfy everyone. The servers go above and beyond to make sure everything is at your liking. The best part of the visit was the dessert.  It’s a must try with family or friends 👍🏻👍🏻

The Cajun House,Cajun/Creole,"7 Saint Anne Street St. Albert, AB T8N 2X4 Canada",AB,53.6354601,-113.6257158,4,"We have been to the Cajun House a few times and thus I was surprised I have not done a review of this restaurant.

My son had the Chicken & Sausage Gumbo which was nice and hot, temperature-wise, and reasonable spicy. I tried it and we both enjoyed it.

For the main meal, my son had the Filet Mignon Ya-Ya which is described as broiled twin medallions of beef tenderloin which is served on a red current, port demi-glace sauce. My son said it was OK , but also above average quality. It is probably just not the type of steak we are used to having for supper.

I had the Breaded Veal Panne, which was veal escalopes, served with pasta tossed with basil cream sauce. To me, the sauce needed to be a bit more of it since the pasta soaked up most of it. The veal had little taste and when I asked my son; it surprised him since he thought it tasted like chicken, not veal. It was nice but not a lot of taste.

All in all, it was a good meal.  The Gumbo was the best part of the meal. The service was great. She was attentive and answered all our questions. We found it cold, we mentioned it to her, and she was able to increase the heat to make it palatable. Yes we would go back."

Mid week lunch break.
I ordered the Chicken Po-Boy - with spinach peppered pecan salad.
The sandwich was delicious, and the salad also was very tasty.
The service was excellent, very friendly server and prompt service.
A wise choice to share a dessert, we chose Banana Indulgence…generous serving, a large portion with enough sweetness for 2 people.
Thanks Cajun House!  See you next time I’m in St. Albert!"

The food was also fast and fresh. The only thing I’d say that needs improvement is their sliced bread that came with the smoked salmon appetizer ( it didn’t taste fresh).

Padmanadi Vegetarian Restaurant,Vegetarian,"10740 101 Street Edmonton, AB T5H 2S3 Canada",AB,53.5524101,-113.4941242,5,"Absolutely the best vegetarian food I have eaten. Everything was fresh and flavourful, to the point where I forgot I was eating vegetarian food.  We ordered a good selection of Asian dishes and none of them were a disappointment. The dessert we had was vegan and was absolutely amazing.  Staff was very attentive and the restaurant itself is clean, modern, and had a very nice vibe.  Clearly a lot of pride from the ownership group. Will be back again for the ultimate test - my father in law who absolutely despises vegetables 😜"

Padmanadi Vegetarian Restaurant,Vegetarian,"10740 101 Street Edmonton, AB T5H 2S3 Canada",AB,53.5524101,-113.4941242,4,"Padmanadi is a legendary vegan restaurant in Edmonton. It was one of the first to represent the vegan lifestyle through food so creatively and tastefully.

Upon a recent visit, not much has changed. The same family pictures adorn the walls, the giant Buddha still sits where he always has, and the food is pretty much of the same standard.

The thought I share is that vegetarian and vegan food has moved forward in creativity rapidly over the last decade.  One visit to Vancouver on the west coast will demonstrate vegetarian food of wild and passionate creativity. I feel Padmanadi has a lot of room for growth there.

Our service was outstanding.  And the space is still effective. I just wish the food was a little more progressive given how far vegan food has come in its methods of delivery.

Overall, it's still a good visit.

Barbecue King City,Barbeque,"10606 - 97 Street Edmonton, AB T5H 2L6 Canada",AB,53.5504746,-113.4890612,5,"What an absolute GEM!

A few friends & I went in for the first time & ordered a pound of BBQ pork (around $11-12) and a half pound of pig ear.

Wow!

The BBQ pork was so juicy, so flavourful, and had the right amount of lil' crispy bits on the end. It came with a BAG of sauce that we dumped over all & I wish I ate this with rice so we could soak up even more flavourful from those savoury juices.

This is one of the best things I've ever eaten in Edmonton. Incredible.

For pig ear, it was my first time. They ask you if you want the meat chopped up. Say yes, absolutely, just makes it easier to start eating right away. Very tasty pig ear.

We wanted to order squid but by 1pm it was sold out (which means you know it's tasty!)

Anywho, go support this small local business because their food is incredible.

Heads up, cash only.
And yes, it's worth making a trip to the bank to make this happen."

Best Chinese BBQ duck in the city amongst a variety of other meats such as crispy Roasted pork, Hainan chicken, soy chicken, sausage and BBQ pork. They also have marinated squid and the freshest wonton noodles. Forewarning, call ahead to reserve if you can’t swing by in the morning-they sell out of duck pretty fast!"

The Next Act,Pubs,"8224 104 Street NW Edmonton, AB T6E 4E6 Canada",AB,53.5188418,-113.4979408,3,"The atmosphere at this local spot is lively, with dim lighting that adds to its charm. The drink selection is commendable, offering a variety of choices to suit different palates.

The food, however, is a mixed bag. The Korean fried tofu sandwich and nachos were enjoyable, but the inconsistency in the quality of the fries was noticeable, varying from burnt to just okay across visits. The kitchen also seemed to struggle with accommodating food modifications for dietary restrictions, which could be a concern for those with specific dietary needs.

The service was fairly standard, neither exceptionally good nor bad. The restaurant was busy during the visit, indicating its popularity among locals.

The presentation of the food was nothing out of the ordinary, but the pricing was reasonable for the quantity and quality of food served.

While the food and service could use some improvement, the lively atmosphere and good drink selection make this place worth a visit. However, those with specific dietary restrictions might want to consider other options."
The Next Act,Pubs,"8224 104 Street NW Edmonton, AB T6E 4E6 Canada",AB,53.5188418,-113.4979408,4,Had a nice dinner out at The Next Act. Enjoyed the Critic… bacon cheeseburger. It had a bit of kick… a creeping spiciness that was really good. Fries were good. The beer was nice and cold. There was a really good variety of beer choices. Service was excellent!
The Next Act,Pubs,"8224 104 Street NW Edmonton, AB T6E 4E6 Canada",AB,53.5188418,-113.4979408,4,"The Next Act is a lively pub offering many different assortments of food. My friends and I went over for their Sunday brunch and were not disappointed! With spot on food, reasonable pricing, and a homey atmosphere (that also offers patio seating), this place is a must try.
My partner and I ordered the Traditional Eggs Benedict and Chicken Bacon Brie Sandwich. The Eggs Benedict had a creamy and tangy hollandaise sauce; however, the eggs were little over. This may be because we were not offered a choice on how we wanted our eggs, but the amazing tater tots offset this minor imperfection. The choice of tater tots over the more traditional hashbrowns really makes this place standout compared to other brunch spots. The Chicken Bacon Brie Sandwich was amazing! The chicken breast was juicy, the bread didn’t go soggy, and the garlic aioli added a nice creaminess to harmonize the sandwich perfectly.
The service is what you would expect from a lively pub. Our server was accommodating, pleasant, and very patient as our friends slowly poured in. He did go on break during our meal so we had to wait longer than usual for the bill, but his overall service was good.
Overall, The Next Act is a place I would recommend to my friends to try at least once. The homey atmosphere, great food, and kind service are the perfect recipe for a good experience."

The service was a bit slow (likely due to it being peak lunch time hours) but the food made it worth the wait! The chicken bacon brie sandwich was so tasty and I liked how it came with a side of fries (every sandwich and burger comes with fries; my picture does not do it justice). I wasn't the biggest fan of the seating arrangement as it felt quite cramped especially with the mix of high and low tables, but because of the food, I will definitely be returning!"

I choose plain with lemon so I could taste the true flavor of the schnitzel, it was fantastic. Everyone else had a different topping and each equally enjoyed theirs. They have a moderate beer selection which was cold, crisp and went down quite quickly. The only disappointment was in the dessert selection we were looking for some German sweets but there are none on the menu. This was the only thing missing, so if planning a visit and you're looking for dessert simply plan another stop after this one, but don't miss the schnitzel!"

Money to food wise it's one of the best value meals in the city. Soy garlic chicken was crispy,tasty and the soy garlic sauce they use is my favourite in the city. Dunking fries in left over sauce is delicious. My one complaint is all the other sides/side salads at SFC are just alright. I have tried most of the sides and most of them are fine but skippable"

They had an interesting set up where you order on one end, and pick up at the end of a hallway. The food was worth the money. Will have to give it a try again in the future.

I can't say enough positive things about the cilantro lime chicken! To say it's delicious is an understatement.

The service I found to be a little lax especially when I asked about whether the business could accommodate a party of 20. I felt rushed and will have to make another visit for a true comparison.

I used to love Seoul Fried Chicken at the Old Strathcona location when they first opened (although even they've gone downhill now), but the chicken at this downtown location tastes very different. The sauce is not good, and the chicken was soggy and not at all crispy. I wouldn't go back.

The restaurant itself is very cute, though. I like the murals and the painted pillars."

This is the flavour I remember from when I was a kid in Regina heading over to Mosaic and visiting the Ukrainian pavillions.

Yo Baba's location is easy to access north just off the Yellowhead at 82nd Street - the strip mall behind the McDonalds on the corner.

Heading in for a quick pickup was easy. There is a cooler with items ready for pickup, and you can order off the menu as well. Love supporting local, and supporting Ukrainian!"

I also recommend trying the crispy Radish and Ham Pastry. The beef buns are juicy and soft. If you go in a big group, just try different types of foods. Most of them are tasty. I haven't found a 2nd place that sell delicious soup dumplings in Edmonton. So this is where I go if you ask for soup dumplings."

The food were excellent, the wine was divine, and the service exceptional and friendly.

Ahi Tuna salad - The tuna was fresh and delicious, the cucumber and green salad was delicious, with a twist of curry in the sauce.

Tomatoes Bruschetta - Served with a crunchy baguette and a delicious tomato salad, don't miss out

I have to say the Octopus is a delicious dish that is perfectly prepared and is accompanied by a delicious olive tapenade. It melts in your mouth like butter!

Even though we were so full, the lobster risotto was the perfect end to a great meal

The wine menu was unique and there was a 50% discount on Wednesdays so we enjoyed excellent Spanish wines. Dry Rose & Verdejo

The kitchen will always substitute vegetables and food-sensitive/allergy options whenever possible. Make sure you try the artichokes!

Definitely one of my favorites!"

It was a hit and a miss. Some were amazing - scallops, cesar salad and calamari. Some were complete miss - meat balls were sooo salty we had to send them back, flourless chocolate cake (gf) were soo dry. Yes it's GF, but I've had rich Moist GF cakes before. When we asked the server what flour was used, she just guessed her answer and didn't even bother finding out the exact answer either."

Found a huge lettuce bug in our dish crawling around. Check your food before you eat it. All the restaurant did was take the plate away did not even offer to comp anything. Worst experience ever. Immediately lost my appetite and couldn't finish with the rest of dinner. Didn't even bother taking the left overs. If I could rate this zero stars I would.

The restaurant was about 1/2 full already. The wait staff took my order quickly but the best part was how how my food was. It's so nice when the food is brought to your table still piping hot. It was delicious with a cold beer in a hot day. Parking could prove challenging as there is a popular cafe next door as well. The owner seems to take great pride in his establishment, walking around and checking to see if the patrons food was alright."

What sets Belgravia Hub apart is their versatile menu that caters to all tastes, ranging from savory beef and chicken dishes to flavorful seasoned salmon and veggie burgers.

The exceptional service at Belgravia Hub is also something I value greatly. Recently, I made a reservation to celebrate my birthday with a group of friends over dinner. Despite being the last ones to leave the restaurant, which was already 10 minutes past closing time, we felt warmly welcomed throughout our stay. We indulged in a wide selection of dishes, beverages, desserts, and coffee. While the food was good, it was the overall experience that truly stood out to us.

I will definitely come back and highly recommend this place."

Today, however, I was very disappointed in my lunch. The dressing on my salad was delicious, lemon-dill, but for something advertised as a Summer Shrimp Salad, it should have more than 6 small shrimp on it, and for $18, it should DEFINITELY have more than 6 small shrimp on it."

The service was good too but I wished they gave water more frequently or gave a jar of it. Had to remind waiter to refill water after asking a few times already. It is sort of loud in the restaurant that I couldn't hear the person in front of me well either. Other than that the food is delicious.

I highly recommend this restaurant.  Never having Turkish food before was surprising that I would enjoy EVERYTHING that our party is 12 had. The sharing platter meal is the way to go.

Go and see for yourself.  Thanks for the amazing taste sensation.

Pho Tau Bay,Vietnamese,"10660 98 St NW Edmonton, AB T5H 2N7 Canada",AB,53.5513246,-113.4908927,4,"Tau Bay serves only Pho, they don't even offer spring rolls as a side.  Their menu is focused on producing quality Pho and that's it and that's exactly what they do. I first went here 10 years ago? with some friends of mine and I've been back every now and then to enjoy their Pho. On my last trip I tried their Lemon Coke, which is basically a can of coke served with a glass that has ice and lemon juice? in it. Just add the coke yourself and its pretty tasty. I will say their Pho is delicious however the last time I was there the amount of meat I got was not much. I do wish they offered Vietnamese spring rolls, they are super delicious. Also they didn't have any chili oil for free (Think I had to pay extra for it???), that and the low amount of meat stopped it from being 5 stars."
Pho Tau Bay,Vietnamese,"10660 98 St NW Edmonton, AB T5H 2N7 Canada",AB,53.5513246,-113.4908927,4,Good pho. Cash or e transfer only. I loved the pho but bigger portions would have been nice.
Pho Tau Bay,Vietnamese,"10660 98 St NW Edmonton, AB T5H 2N7 Canada",AB,53.5513246,-113.4908927,5,"Tau Bay is a one of a kind place where they specialize in soups and they are phenomenal. I've had plenty of really good pho around Edmonton but Tau Bay is on another level that nobody else can compare to. I've been a long time customer since they used to be on 107ave and 113st and their pho hits just right every single time since I've first discovered them. If there's a list of must try places in western Canada, Tau Bay better be on it.
I'm not sure how to describe how delicious their pho is. I find each bowl to be perfectly balanced with meat, noodles and their umami rich broth. You are free to add hoisin, bean sprouts, hot sauce and a squeeze of lime if that's your preference but I like to enjoy it as is with one thai chili for a bit of heat. The broth alone is heavenly. Please note that it's soup only with beverages and some desserts. They take only cash or email transfers."
Pho Tau Bay,Vietnamese,"10660 98 St NW Edmonton, AB T5H 2N7 Canada",AB,53.5513246,-113.4908927,5,The Vietnamese pho is the most authentic I have ever had in Canada. It’s so tasty and not expensive. Fried rice is also my favourites.
Pho Tau Bay,Vietnamese,"10660 98 St NW Edmonton, AB T5H 2N7 Canada",AB,53.5513246,-113.4908927,3,"Soup is good.  But if you are spicy person, I do not recommend here.
I asked for chili pepper, but they only give you 1.

It was same many years ago, and I visited again after few years hoping they would change.

Chili pepper cost so little, don't understand why they don't give it to customers.

And btw, they take cash only!!"

If you like cheese, their cheese sticks were so dense and wonderful, especially with the special green sauce they serve with it. The dry pork bite things were everything you want dry ribs to be. Meaty, salty, tear-apart-able.

Be ready and hungry though as I think everything in the menu is very filling."

7th November 2022

I was a tourist in Edmonton and this was a place that came on the recommenddation list. So I had to try it.

I came here and the host suggested i go for the rice bowl with beef and the sugarcane lemonade.

The food was so tasty and so was the lemonade.
I would definitely recommend this place and would hopefully come back in the future to try more."

I thought perhaps it wouldn’t be traditional enough (more mainstream) but I was wrong! Absolutely delicious Venezuelan style breakfast/brunch offerings, that include arepas. I ordered the Traditional, which I would highly recommend! Amazing place to try if you’re looking for a new brunch spot."

This is an excellent restaurant!"

Our waiter, Colin, gave us extremely good service. He was friendly, professional, and attentive the entire time. The food was excellent and we were happy with the quality and taste! The view of downtown Edmonton and the River Valley was also fantastic. This is the second time we have been to La Ronde and both times we had a really nice experience. I would recommend trying out this restaurant to anyone looking for a lovely place to celebrate a special occasion or just to have a good fine dining experience."

I was in town exhibiting at K-days and decided to take a break from talking to hundreds of people at the convention and have a quiet, solo meal at a nice restaurant.

La Ronde was exactly what I needed!

The food was decent but not incredible. My bison steak was a little overcooked (I asked for medium rare and it was not even pink inside) and the creme brulee was not set properly so it kind of had the consistency of scrambled eggs...I did love the veggies and the flavor of the steak, and really appreciated that the mocktails were all ~$5/ea (as it should be).

The service honestly more than made up for any shortcomings with the food! Dean, my server, was SO nice and above and beyond charming and helpful. He really made me feel taken care of, and gave me some great travel advice.

The revolving aspect was also pretty interesting. A little vertigo-inducing at first but it was easy to adjust to and then it was just lovely to have views served to me throughout the course of the meal. Definitely would recommend this place!"
La Ronde Revolving Restaurant,Steakhouses,"10111 Bellamy Hill NW Edmonton, AB T5J 1N7 Canada",AB,53.5389837,-113.4939471,5,"We arrived at 5:30 for a wonderful experience that lasted nearly two hours. We started by having cocktails, and between the three of us had two appetizers: the brisket in cheese sauce and the crab cakes. We also ordered one wild mushroom soup. The appetizers all arrived quite fast and were very good. Next time I would skip the crab cakes, but would definitely order the brisket and mushroom soup again!

The entrees we ordered are all pictured here.  We had the prime rib, NY steak, and the seafood stew. They arrived the same time as the fresh peppercorn offering.

We finished our meal with a cappuccino and mango cheesecake. Our server was pleasant, timely,  and professional with a dash of perfectly tasteful humor. What a treat! 👌"

In town for a tattoo convention, staying at the hotel, wanted an easy dinner. This turned into an entire event lasting two hours.

The staff is genuinely friendly and knowledgeable, they explain the menu so well you have a hard time picking what to eat. The featured gin sour was refreshing and borderline dangerous with how quickly it can go down.

Make sure to book a reservation, kids friendly, great food and fair prices. Make sure you check out their wine menu as well and some of their functions.

Hope you visit and let me know what you think. Keep on eating and have fun.

Bar Bricco,Italian,"10347 Jasper Avenue Edmonton, AB T5J 1Y7 Canada",AB,53.5407484,-113.4987221,4,"I like it, the menu is just long enough with many intriguing options to choose from. The service was on point and we got a seat in the back area which was cozy, but it was quite dark. Needs a little more light, it's especially an issue when trying to read the menu, not fun having to pull your phone out to use the flashlight. The food was tasty, but we did have a couple of plates where the kitchen was heavy handed with the salt (and I'm a person that really likes salt!). They did fix it and we overall enjoyed our meal"
Bar Bricco,Italian,"10347 Jasper Avenue Edmonton, AB T5J 1Y7 Canada",AB,53.5407484,-113.4987221,4,"Great great Hospitality...More cocktail options would make this place 5 stars for me ..they Have like 6 cocktails on the menu..we tried 4 and all were good...Perfectly balanced using fresh fruits and good choice of spirits...
Their food was a show stealer...balanced on flavors although we just had 2 options for vegetarians except salads..
Place has great potential..we would definitely recommend this place and return if they add more vegitarian dishes for us to try..
Great to see such places in Edmonton.."

My first visit to Bar Bricco was for my mum’s 60th birthday and it was such a wonderful experience for us. The food is Incredible, the wine is excellent, the service is terrific. It is quite dark, which isn’t the best but it gives the place a certain ambiance. The raviolo al uovo is the absolute most delicious thing on the menu. The agnolotti is so perfectly cooked. Caparzo wine is hard to find in Alberta. Skip the truffle butter crostini."
Bar Bricco,Italian,"10347 Jasper Avenue Edmonton, AB T5J 1Y7 Canada",AB,53.5407484,-113.4987221,3,"I have mixed feelings about Bar Bricco after dining there last night. I had decided to celebrate my birthday with my boyfriend there because I enjoyed the food the last two times I came.

The quality of the food was excellent - the same as I had remembered it - and our dishes arrived very quickly. If you are a pasta, butter and cheese lover, I would highly suggest ordering the Fonduta Agnolotti and the Egg Yolk Raviolo.

The service was okay. Our server asked if we had any questions about the menu and refilled our water without being asked. However, she did not seem warm or personable.

The atmosphere was uncomfortable for me. Honestly, I felt like I was eating in the dark - I even had to use the flashlight from my phone to read the menu. My boyfriend's voice was drowned out by the music and by the laughter of the 4 girls sitting next to us. By the time we finished our meal, my ears were ringing. I had zero desire to stay and enjoy my cocktail. We were in and out of the restaurant within an hour."

The service is really good. Our server Anna is very friendly and helpful . The Deep fried calamari is the best in town in my opinion.  Fried to perfection!!! The fish maw soup has so much fish maw in it . It's not only tasty , it's great for the price. Deep fried fish is the bomb , it's crispy on the outside and the fish is not overcooked , it's fresh and tasty. I would highly recommend this gem in Chinatown. Their food really hits home."
Sai Woo Garden Restaurant,Chinese,"10571 97 St NW Edmonton, AB T5H 2L4 Canada",AB,53.5499707,-113.4883918,5,"After going out for dinner at two new restaurants and being disappointed with the meal at both, I just had to go to my favorite Chinese restaurant that I have been going to since I was a kid. I believe this may be the oldest running Chinese restaurant in Edmonton ( please correct me if I'm wrong). You can always count on this restaurant to be consistent with the quality of their food. Always fresh and they are so fast in serving each dish. Staff is friendly even when it's really busy. The deep fried calamari has got to be the most iconic dish that everyone orders. The batter is so light and crispy. Everything tastes good here. We order the dinner for six so we can have leftovers. The restaurant is old and could use some new upgrades but I take comfort in the atmosphere that still remains the same along with their amazing food that I've enjoyed with my family as a kid and now my own family gets to enjoy their food. Thanks Sai Woo staff for the wonderful meal and service."

Danny, Alex, and Anna are all great. Danny even recommended some amazing dishes that we haven’t tried before! Great quality dishes and always delicious. They are also good with substitutions and allergies. My cousin can’t have gluten, so they were willing to make a noodle dish without soy sauce just for her. Overall amazing restaurant and tasty food! My family’s favourite Chinese restaurant in Edmonton!"

Rocky Mountain Icehouse,Southern,"10516 Jasper Avenue Edmonton, AB T5K 1X4 Canada",AB,53.5411855,-113.5016248,3,"Food was good but that took longer than necessary. It was game night for the Oilers but the bar wasn't that busy. Waited more than an hour for a couple of burgers and a couple of wings.

Other than that, our server was super nice and apologetic. Kept checking up on us. And the manager at the time was good too."

Got a patio area in the back but due to the rain the make shift tarp for protection wasn't working to well as water was falling through. Staff was accommodating. Didn't eat anything at the time but the Jasper cocktail was delicious.

Originally went to cask & barrel and the waitress recommended to go  here for the larger menu. our server was absolutely the best. they have the best crab cakes I've ever had! Not overcooked, not burnt or greasy and perfect portion for the price. I also had the pork belly with the smashed potatoes, holy smokes were they delicious! my date had the Southern fried chicken and the mac and cheese. the only thing I recommend is the mac and cheese needs to be cheesier! so nice to have a slice of watermelon on the side. the watermelon Caesar salad is also really really good!! Definitely coming back."

Second time, we came on a Sunday afternoon. Ordered 2 beers after waiting a few minutes. Waited 10 minutes before the server asked if we’d like a refill of our water. We were still waiting for the beers we ordered 10 minutes earlier. The place wasn’t exactly busy. Don’t waste your time."
Double Greeting Wonton House,Chinese,"10212 96 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5H 2G7 Canada",AB,53.5448882,-113.4830567,5,"Awesome experience at Double Greeting, as always. The food and atmosphere is always top notch. You can find many HK inspired classic dishes here. The diner style booths are wide and comfortable. The newly renovated washroom is clean and well laid out. They appear to be slightly understaffed but not the extent that it would impact the overall experience. I would recommend ordering quickly once you arrive as it is quite busy around the lunch hour."

Will I go back, I'll not
I ordered take out after dine in and waited for 40 mins for only 1 appetizer and 1 fried rice
The fried flat noodles stick together and it taste so so
Service is slow as they clean tables instead of getting my order when I arrive
So I waited for 10 mins for server

Is it authentic? Yes
Is it like HK restaurant? Yes but is really those not up to par and those that you will not go back if u are in Asia. If it's in Asia, it will be a 2/10... But for here in Edmonton... I guess... You can't ask for more here but I'll still choose not to go back"
Double Greeting Wonton House,Chinese,"10212 96 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5H 2G7 Canada",AB,53.5448882,-113.4830567,5,This is some of the Best Authentic Asian food in the Edmonton Downtown Area.  Like the location a little hard to get into but some of the best food you can find in the area.  Again this is authentic Chinese Food so if you are looking for the North American (Western) experience this may not be for you.  For anyone else there is a huge selection of food for you to order from and they will make the some menu items spicy to taste for those who are like the food a little more bold.

They do not accept debit or credit. There is a cash machine but expect to pay a service fee."

The waitress was great and recommended chicken strips and fries for my son which she said was around $8. They were made from scratch and cooked to perfection, like perfectly moist. Their french fries were seasoned impeccably. I had a beef dip, the roast beef could have been higher quality. But the bun it was served on was fresh and delicious. The gravy that came with it was pretty good too. Thanks for the amazing service and really good food"

service: it was a full house - and even so service was friendly and quick.

food: amazing. Generous portions. Great flavour. We had left overs."

Atmosphere was really cool with all the drawings and graffiti on the walls, tables and chairs.

Service was amazing, the employee whom I forgot his name, but he was very welcoming and friendly. We also got our food served fresh and quick too!

Last but not least, the food is delicious! I ordered the mushroom burger, and it was just a heavenly combination, from the toasted buttery bun, to the crispy onions, juicy patty and perfect balance of gravy, mayo, cheese and mayo!

Poutine was also perfect from the crispy fries, cheese curds and gravy on top.

I highly recommend going here, as it will be an experience you won't want to miss!"

They serve breakfast options all day (Amazing! Hard to find in Edmonton). Once I got there and looked more at the menu, I had a lot of trouble deciding against my idea of getting breakfast or not. There were so many delicious options. I ordered the Bacon Brioche sandwich. It did not disappoint! I highly recommend this sandwich but I do warn you, it is messy. I will be returning asap to try some non-breakfast options and for sure will be returning for breakfast/brunch as well. The owner was great to chat with, very welcoming and personable. Neat and unique atmosphere with all the tables and walls covered in sharpie art -
no need to dress fancy XD."

You can draw on the tables and walls. I had the diner burger and poutine. My husband had a breakfast burger and my daughter had the chicken burger. For our taste, we found the gravy too salty... However, if you like salty gravy! This is the place for you! I may come back and try something else. However, I made a poor choice of getting the diner burger, since it also has gravy on it. Whoops. I'd recommend sticking to one item with gravy for your first visit. And again, service was great! Everyone was super friendly."

They serve up incredibly creative and innovative burgers and fries as Local Omnivore used to. So delicious!

The slushies tasted exactly the same - the orange had no hint of citrus, both tasted like the blue raspberry.

Hopefully my next experience will be better."

We had their Giant Grouper special + a veggie dish and the peach shrimp. Peach shrimp sauce wise is a bit dry, but the shrimp was fresh.

Jorge was absolutely wonderful and takes pride in his service🙏  My food hit the spot in a way a home cooked meal does and the hot sauce was drool worthy. It was worth the trip down! 25 stars❤"

service: slow considering there were only 3 tables there at lunch time. Only one server but did not check in. Did not offer water or napkins etc.

establishment: nice central location. Parking in front or neighbouring streets.

food: the guacamole starter was delicious. The tacos looked amazing - they just lacked some flavour. I was expecting authentic Mexican flavour but it was all very bland."
Frida Urban Taqueria,Mexican,"12411 Stony Plain Road Edmonton, AB T5N 3N3 Canada",AB,53.5468881,-113.5367091,3,"Although the food was good, it is quite pricey for the portion size. I'm confused with the 1.5 thin slices of lime, in addition to the single slice of radish, 2 slices of cucumber for 7 tacos. The guac and chips portion was also very small for $14. Unfortunately, I also think charging for every single thing like lime and sauces threw the experience off for me a bit due to the portions. However, I am cognizant the location may have played into the pricing.

Otherwise, the atmosphere is pleasant and esthetically cute."

I ordered the smoked chicken with the Lamplighter BBQ sauce, mashed potatoes, coleslaw and cornbread.  The entire meal was served to me in 7 minutes.
Thoroughly enjoyed the coleslaw and mashed; the cornbread was a little too dense for my liking but very tasty.  I found the smoked chicken to be very dry, and I wasn't a huge fan of the BBQ sauce.  I also ordered their Bluebeary Ale which I would definitely have again.

All in all, next time I'm in town, I'll give it another try.  Based on other reviews, I'm sure the other dishes on the menu are worth the try."

As my rating goes this place has so much potential but it could be way better definitely wouldn’t eat here again
the moistness of the meat and fall apart aspect of it 10/10 the seasoning and Flavour aspect 1/10 was not there was not giving

Mac and cheese was a 0/10 was no flavour noodles weren’t even al dente they were hard

Mashed potatoes 10/10

The meat platter was 5/10
The five was the fall apart aspect and tenderness but the chicken was very dry
The sausage was amazing !

The barbecue sauces need to be blended a lot more if these are home made but as of those I’d give a solid 4

Burnt ends 8/10 !!

Brisket was 5/10

Cornbread 10/10

Ribs 2/10 was not giving what it needed was very dry and lacked flavour"

My husband and I started with some burnt ends which I only got a picture of after we were halfway finished. Then we decided on the large smoked meat platter with sides of Mac & cheese and dill pickle spears to share. The platter came with a large serving of smoked pulled pork, another large serving of smoked brisket, a large piece of smoked chicken, about 4 or 5 large smoked ribs, a smoked sausage, two pieces of cornbread, and four bbq sauces, along with our two sides that we ordered. Everything was delicious!!! The coolest part was this was part of Princess Auto and the menu had a brief description of Princess Auto's history on the top - so neat. The atmosphere was a cozy industrial setting with lots of seating and the waitresses were friendly and attentive. We will definitely be returning!!!"
Boualouang Laos & Thai Cuisine,Thai,"10569 97th Street NW Edmonton, AB T5H 2L7 Canada",AB,53.5499637,-113.4883928,1,"My 2nd time here. I came back because the food was excellent the 1st time. However, this experience was so bad. I called at 4:30 for pickup and was told it would be ready at 5:30. Upon arrival the only thing that was ready were 2 appetizers. I ended up waiting until 6:30. I checked my order before the server packed it and 2 of the dishes were wrong. Then an argument ensued where I was told I had ordered red curry. I ordered Matsuman, etc. Finally, the server realized she was wrong and had to go back to the kitchen and re-order, thus more waiting. By the time I got the Massaman curry, everything else was ice cold. And then when we started eating, not only was everything cold, all of it was disgusting. Overcooked/ mushy, bland, oily and 1 order was still wrong. Plus, I paid extra for 2 coconut rice and got 2 steamed rice. Fried eggs mysteriously appeared on the #18 Pad-ka-pow; shrimp stir fry. What a fiasco. Doubt I will be returning. My observations while waiting were that the restaurant is lacking proper management, the kitchen is understaffed, the existing staff/ servers/ etc, are not trained, thus there is extremely poor efficiency.
Please see food photos: 1:  I'm not sure what this was supposed to be? It was overcooked shrimp & chicken floating in oil. 2: steamed rice. 3: Menu item #9: Yum; glass noodle salad with shrimp (it had no onions or shrimp or dressing, or peanut sauce dressing that is supposed to come with it) 4: oily spring rolls. 5: menu item #18; Pad Ka Pow. Overcooked, mushy and bland. 6: Matsuman Curry (this was good). This cost me $100, plus I left a 20% tip. Very disappointing!"

Boualouang Laos & Thai Cuisine,Thai,"10569 97th Street NW Edmonton, AB T5H 2L7 Canada",AB,53.5499637,-113.4883928,5,"My first Thai food experience was here at their previously smaller location in Chinatown over ten years ago. This location is much larger and beautifully decorated.

It was great to see Boualuong still in business after the pandemic where many others have not reopen. They are a mom and pop shop who quietly work diligently over the years dishing out some amazing food. Tonight, our group of friends had the privilege to enjoy another great spicy Tom yum soup, original Pad thai without ketchup, delicious green curry and a mango salad. The food was amazing and the portions were generous.

They were understaff with only one server but she and the owner were able to service our large group, plus two other large tables with a smile, grace and pride you would find in any South East Asian home.

When you walk around chinatown, you know the struggle these restaurant owners are going through. By me choosing to eat at this terrific restaurant despite what is going on in this neighborhood, that should tell you how much I enjoy the experience of eating here.

It is a gem for those who recognize this hole in the wall and it was busy as usual here at Boualuong."

Boualouang Laos & Thai Cuisine,Thai,"10569 97th Street NW Edmonton, AB T5H 2L7 Canada",AB,53.5499637,-113.4883928,5,I had a great experience eating here. The green curry with the coconut rice was amazing and the gold bags were yummy yummy. Huge thank you to our server Carmen! She was extremely helpful and caring towards me and I will definitely be coming back.
Pals Sandwiches,Sandwiches,"10335 83 Avenue NW Edmonton, AB T6E 2C6 Canada",AB,53.5189742,-113.4971528,5,"I came to this restaurant for lunch, and it was an amazing experience! We sat at the bar, and were welcomed by our server working at the bar.

Service and atmosphere was amazing. Food was fairly good, I highly recommend getting the chips and onion dip for the sides.

We ordered the breakfast sandwich, and their beef dip. Both without any cheese.

Food was good, nothing too crazy. Next time, I will definitely be trying their chicken sandwich, because it looks amazing.

Overall a good place to try!"

The sandwiches were great. The chicken sandwich and beef dip were both flavourful and made with quality ingredients. The cheesy fries were also great and filling!

The dill pickle soup was good, but a bit too spicy! It’s definitely worth a try if you like dill and spice."
Pals Sandwiches,Sandwiches,"10335 83 Avenue NW Edmonton, AB T6E 2C6 Canada",AB,53.5189742,-113.4971528,5,This was by far one of the best sandwiches we've had here in Edmonton. We tried both the Cuban and the meatball sandwich. The Cuban was delicious with great toppings and the meat used was excellent. The meatball sandwich was also one of the best I've had. The meatballs were so good that I kinda wished they had spaghetti meatballs on the menu! The only thing that could be better would be to use a smaller bread. I found the bread too thick. Could have also used a bit of extra sauce. The sandwiches were $19 with side fries. The fries were also really good and a large portion too. For me personally I don't like when the fries are unpeeled so I didn't eat all of them but they were still really good.

Had to try their Meatballs Sub with House Salad and Saskatoon Lemonade!  Presentation was spectacular, waiting was very minimal, and the experience was awesome!  Thank You Robbie for providing a mouthwatering delicious product!  A perfect lunch on a Sunday!  Get their as I highly recommend it!  Again, Thanks Robbie!"

We ordered their cheese fries, beef dip, hoagie, and s'mores pie. We both tried their craft saskatoon lemonade. They had a delicious soup of the day and their fries were solid. The lighting was intimate as we came an hour before close. Our server was great and he was telling us how they make the bread, soup, and meats from scratch! We were considering trying the Reuben but they had run out of that and their foccacia earlier on that day. We probably would ahve been more than fine just with soup and sandwich - but they did so well as leftovers. Looking forward to next time!"

The Bandeja Paisa is big and worthy. The beef soup is a little bit expensive for the size and I was expecting a stronger flavour. The tequeños were too salty, I have tried them before there but this time was way too much salty. The empanadas are delicious and their salsas are marvellous"

I honestly can't believe how bad it was 2 days ago. A piece of soggy skinned chicken that was undercooked so I couldn't eat it. Cabbage rolls were dried right out and had a taste I can't identify. I ate 2 perogies off my almost 15 dollar plate. So disappointing as I had a quick craving for Ukrainian food. Never again. I'll make my own."

When I brought up Shumka, everyone agreed! I lived on Jasper Ave and had to take 3 buses to get there, but it was well worth it. Now I live in the US and it would be several more buses I'd have to take, but I'll tell ya what: it would be worth it. The food is delicious, abundant and fresh.

Confusing order options and maybe using cheemo perogies? Sausage also wasn't very good. Not at all happy with this whole experience and wouldn't order again."

We were greeted immediately by our server Jeffrey. He was attentive, helpful with advice and opinions, and friendly. I had the blackened chicken sandwich, which absolutely delicious, my wife had the chicken and waffles which she thoroughly enjoyed. The atmosphere was pleasant and the beer selection was top notch.

The Underground Tap & Grill,Pubs,"10004 Jasper Avenue NW Edmonton, AB T5J 1R3 Canada",AB,53.5414626,-113.4906844,4,"There are no burgers here. Craft beers at a 16oz can be found.  It is pricey here the new $22 plate is the old $15 dollar plate.

Reservation made. Although we were missed on the first drink order as another table sat down after us and had their drink order taken before ours which we sat 5mins before them. Me a bit like okay thats why i do reviews.

Food. Seems or actually is very tasty. Made to perfection.  Portion sizes. Well small. The tenderloin buttery soft to cut with a butter knife.  Jamaican curry goat flavourful. But small 3-4 pieces of goat noticed.  Duck wings. Seemed dry but is that normal for duck wings. They did have flavour. Just had that dry bone and flavour to them.

Beer.  Well a great selection of crafts at a 16oz pour.

Women will love this place. Guys will walk away with i wish they had more food options. Take your dare here. But keep your own guy thoughts to yourself. And move on for guys."
The Underground Tap & Grill,Pubs,"10004 Jasper Avenue NW Edmonton, AB T5J 1R3 Canada",AB,53.5414626,-113.4906844,5,"What a place!! They make almost everything on their menu in-house (with exception to some ice cream flavours), which means everything you eat from the bread, to the sauces, to the green onion cakes, are all made here!
The food is mouth-watering just from reading the menu, and every bite is so good that we wound up licking the plates. Emphasis on plates. We came in for just a snack and wound up ordering more than we bargained for!
There are also a diverse amount of local Canadian brewed drinks. Great sour and porter menus, and various flight options to choose from.

They’re coming up on their 10 year anniversary and have truly mastered their crafts! 100% recommend popping in any time for a delightful experience!"

Wasn't sure what to expect from this literally underground tap but they had amazing tasting beer from places throughout Canada, impeccable appetizers, delicious meals, and decadent desserts. Our host was super nice and even helped with some tough decisions on picking the best options!
10/10 will visit again"

The beer menu is extensive and had local options as well as other Canadian craft brewers. I had the ahi tuna bowl as a main, which was tasty, as well as a poutine and nachos to start. The Thursday special was nachos for $10, which was a good deal as they were quite big and very tasty. Our waiter was nice but told us some misleading info about happy hour, but nothing major (he said all beers were $6 when it is really only select beers for that price). Overall, a good experience at a Downtown pub!"
Noodle Feast,Chinese,"3440 99 Street NW Edmonton, AB T6E 5X5 Canada",AB,53.4686084,-113.4879089,4,"Got there right when it opened at noon. Already a line to get in which is a good sign. A large selection of items. We ordered the sliced noodles with beef, rolling noodles in sour and spicy soup with pork, and the hand pulled noodles with beef and beef bone soup. The noodles were excellent quality and taste but the beef bone broth was basic if not a bit bland. The braised beef pieces were perfectly tender. It was the lunch rush and orders were slow coming out of the kitchen and mistimed at tables. Service was adequate."
Noodle Feast,Chinese,"3440 99 Street NW Edmonton, AB T6E 5X5 Canada",AB,53.4686084,-113.4879089,5,"I haven't been to northern China but now i am sure i could eat there very happily . They gave a free can of pop as it was their anniversary.  The noodles were delicious, chewy noodles with savoury pork in chile sauce, clearly a solid dish enjoyed by millions, it was perfection. The dumplings felt handmade, the wrap was thick enough to feel like i was eating noodles with the pork. The pork burger was a surprise hit, full of flavour and the bun looked thick but surprisingly light, clearly handmade.  Don't expect great service, its not about show here. It's clearly about the food, I wouldn't want it any other way. Great pricing."

Been wanting to visit Noodle Feast for a very long time and finally had the chance. I was hoping to get the hand pulled noodles, but having arrived around an hour before closing, they were sold out 😭

Instead I got the cumin fried sliced noodles with beef. The dish was quite good and flavourful. I just feel like there was a little bit too much grease for myself personally (my other friends did not have this issue).

The restaurant and food had an authentic feel to it which was nice.

I'll have to go back to try more food there!"
Noodle Feast,Chinese,"3440 99 Street NW Edmonton, AB T6E 5X5 Canada",AB,53.4686084,-113.4879089,5,Visited Edmonton over the weekebd and decided to have some noodle for lunch. Great authentic dinning experience. Showed up at opening hour and already a Hugh lineup ahead of us waiting. I remembered it was just like that 10 years ago when they first opened up. Hard to believe they are still popular like this nowadays.

Hanjan,Korean,"3735 99 Street NW Edmonton, AB T6E 6J7 Canada",AB,53.4712472,-113.485216,5,"My recent dining experience at Hanjan's South location was pleasant. As soon as we entered, we were welcomed and seated within a few minutes into the tastefully patio-like decorated ambiance, with string lights and dimmed lighting.

The menu was extensive, with a variety of vegetarian options available that were just as tasty as the non-vegetarian ones (Look at the online menu for vegan options!). Personally, I would recommend their spicy rice cake, which consisted of chewy rice cakes and fish tofu. The crispy tofu with soy-ginger sauce is also a must-try option on their vegan online menu.

I also ordered a London fog tea; it was fragrant and soothing with the perfect blend of Earl Grey tea, vanilla, and steamed milk. I couldn't go without trying their mango bingsu. It comes with a copious amount of sweet and juicy mangoes, stacked over a bed of shaved ice and topped with condensed milk. It's perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth. The only downside of my experience was that at times I felt rushed by the service merely from the number of times the waister/waitresses visited my table."
Hanjan,Korean,"3735 99 Street NW Edmonton, AB T6E 6J7 Canada",AB,53.4712472,-113.485216,5,"Visit: April 2023

Visited Hanjan for a party. The staff was quick and accommodating. The restaurant is also very nice and has great vibes, with nice decor that is very comforting.

Shared a lot of food between 3 of us:
- Kimchi Fried Rice is pretty standard, good flavour. Not a ton of meat, but price wise it's pretty decent
- Bulgogi Fries are amazing. Fries are very fresh, the sauce has good depth, and pairs well with the meat. Highly recommend this as a appetizer
- Grilled Pork Belly was good as well. When it comes to pork belly, this is one of the better places I've had it. The pieces are marinated and grilled well. There's a good amount there as well for the price (got the full size order)
- They provide Sides as well which include kimchi, bean sprouts, pickled radish, and a mashed potato. These pair well with some of the dishes
- Bulgogi Udon is pretty standard too like the kimchi fried rice, nothing too special here. But the noodles are cooked well and are flavourful with hints of beef
- Army Stew (budae jjigae). I love army stew, and this one is pretty good as well. They include instant noodles which is a nice touch. Good amount of meat in the mix too, but wish there was more tofu
- Cheese Corn was alright. For some reason I tasted a bit of Mexican spices/flavours in there which threw me off a little
- Tequila shots (patron) was surprisingly well priced in restsurant/bar standards at $4 a shot. Was smooth going down too

Overall everything above split between 3 people was about $48 before tip, which is pretty good considering what we got.

The prices here are a bit higher than other Korean restaurants I've been to, but is still quite good in general, and I find myself coming back from time to time"
Hanjan,Korean,"3735 99 Street NW Edmonton, AB T6E 6J7 Canada",AB,53.4712472,-113.485216,1,"The ambiance is great, the servers were friendly. Beef bulgogi was good, and as per my son, the rice is great! Until they served us our most awaited fried chicken, only to find out it was partially cooked. I think it's a cardinal rule to all restaurants to make sure the chicken is well cooked to prevent spread of diseases such as Salmonella. I was surprised and disappointed that they forgot about this. This is just a big no.
This happened during Mother's Day dinner, and it seems like they weren't prepared enough to how busy it will get. They should have anticipated it and not compromise the quality and safety of the food they serve."
Kazoku Ramen,Ramen,"16518 100 Avenue NW Edmonton, AB T5P 4Y2 Canada",AB,53.539669,-113.607027,5,"We had dinner on a Sunday and I would say coming in an hour before closing will be a tight call. It got busy but 10-20 minutes wait is manageable as long as you’re not hungry. By far, I love their service. Very friendly staffs. Even love their menus. First time trying their Japanese Cream Soda and it was just ok. Ordered to satisfy our curiosity. Their soups as always are superb. Very filling and served in a big bowl. I’ll keep coming back here. Price is reasonable too for the quantity and quality. Clean restaurant as well."
Kazoku Ramen,Ramen,"16518 100 Avenue NW Edmonton, AB T5P 4Y2 Canada",AB,53.539669,-113.607027,3,"Not bad tonkotsu ramen.

The noodles were good, the meat was tasty, but broth wasnt up to par.

The broth wasnt bad per say, it could have been much better but it was ruined due to the abundance of beansprouts.
Every sip is an aftertaste of beansprouts.

They're also pretty cheap on toppings, the pork only had two thin slices and egg was only half of one? For this price?
The only generous topping was beansprouts, which again I say, ruined the broth.

However the resturant eastern atmosphere is very nice along with anime songs blasting, definitely how I would like to eat my ramen"
Kazoku Ramen,Ramen,"16518 100 Avenue NW Edmonton, AB T5P 4Y2 Canada",AB,53.539669,-113.607027,4,Food was great but it definitely seemed like they were understaffed as it took a really long time to be seated and have our order taken. I do recommend trying the ramen here. People were getting pretty upset about the wait time so that had an impact on the atmosphere. But I do think in normal circumstances when they are fully staffed that it would be a good atmosphere. I really like the decorations and you get sesame to grind up and put in your ramen which is cool.
Kazoku Ramen,Ramen,"16518 100 Avenue NW Edmonton, AB T5P 4Y2 Canada",AB,53.539669,-113.607027,5,"My husband and I loved our first visit here! We went right at the opening on a Saturday and the single front of house staff was amazing! We were seated right away, along with the other 10-15 customers and received our food within 10 minutes.

Definitely a historic eatery in Edmonton. Walls are lined with articles, photos, and lots of memorabilia, definitely dig the old school vibe. The service is top-notch--staff is friendly and welcoming. Food and the value are decent. Was expecting bigger portions, but the prices are inexpensive. Definitely worth a visit.

Commodore Restaurant,Diners,"10712 Jasper Avenue NW Edmonton, AB T5J 2A7 Canada",AB,53.5410997,-113.5052761,5,An Edmonton institution. It's a classic sort of diner that offers basic breakfast and lunch options for some of the lowest prices you'll see these days (although the prices have gone up along with everything else post-pandemic). I love the vibes here. Very unpretentious and welcoming place and they offer some kitschy but entertaining musical acts on the weekends. I feel like more of a true Edmontonian now that I've visited the Commodore!

Visited El Mariachi and it was great! I got the enchiladas, which was pretty filling! It tasted pretty good as well, though the chicken was a bit dry.

I did also have some of the birria tacos (only available on weekends) and those were superb. Extremely hot, fresh, and crispy. The dipping sauce was also very flavourful, so I'd highly recommend it!

I also had the carne asada tortas which I bought home and ate the next day and wow was the carne asada meat amazing!! Extremely tasty and works well with the creaminess of the avocado.

When dining in, they gave some free chips with sauce. The service was a bit slow, but they made everything fresh.

The atmosphere is also great. There's so much decorations and everything just felt really unique and authentic! There's also a mini store inside where you xna purchase Mexican goods

Overall, highly recommend, especially the birria tacos and tortas"

I've never had real authentic Mexican food before, such as enchiladas and mole, and I was so amazed by the deliciousness of the food!! Totally blew me away. The prices were really great too, and the waiter told us about $2 tacos on Tuesdays (before 6pm)!"

The food was really close to authentic Mexican food and our waitress was super friendly. We ordered carne asada, tortas, and quesabirrias and everything was so delicious. It did take about 35 minutes to get our food, but the menu does mention that some dishes take longer to prepare. Overall, we are definitely going back. I'm excited to try more dishes and they even told us that on Tuesdays, all the tacos are only $2! Can't wait to go back and try more."

We’ve known this restaurant was here for years but never took the time to visit. We stopped for lunch and turns out it’s fantastic. The service is phenomenal! We were greeted immediately and provided with friendly, prompt, and passionate service. It’s clear the owners care about their product and customers very much! The food was amazing. The wings were on special and we had lunch features from the menu. Everything had that distinct smoky barbecue flavour you go for and the sides were incredible. You’ve got to try the fries! My child was treated so well by the staff. We will be going again for the food and the service. What a wonderful experience!"

Having not been for awhile I was very surprised with the prices. Lunch was good and the fries were excellent. You wait on yourself so you are up and down at times asking for what is not on the table, salt & pepper, ketchup. The brisket and rib ends were tender, BBQ sauce the best."

Today we went for my sisters birthday and had an amazing time as usual! Today was particularly amazing due to our waiter, Aidan, who made us feel very welcomed and tended to! He made sure that everything was to our liking and made pleasant conversation that made the dinner feel welcoming.

The food was delicious and has great value for its price. Even when the place is busy, we still got served quickly and had a great time. I couldn’t recommend it enough."

If Koreans try this , they will know. Like the picture, I didn't even have soup at all. I just picked the meat out and ate it. and they didn't peel the potato off. On the top of that, employees were FIGHTING IN THE KITCHEN. The female server or kitchen staff kept SCREAMING OR CRYING. I don't think this was appropriate behavior in the restaurant where customers are. Or, I assume they made weird soup while they were fighting. It was seriously horrible experience in my life....... I don't actually understand why this restaurant has more than 4 stars rating on Google map. PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE. I want to remove this experience in my head to be honest............"

OK for me. Everything was too heavy on the soy. The seafood pancake had a good amount of seafood but was strangley very egg-y in taste and texture.     I also was not impressed with how little banchan was provided, especially since you have to pay extra for it as it was not included with the meals. The picture I attached was how it was brought out, with 4 tiny pieces of radish in each dish. I did enjoy the corn cheese very much though."

The food here is amazing no matter what you order, everything is delicious. My personal favorite is the Swiss sandwich, the salty pretzel bun really adds so much flavor. This time I actually got to try the teacup cheesecake and although it was a bit smaller then expected it was sooo good. It has a sugar cookie bottom, with chocolate and cheesecake and also came with a fresh strawberry on top. Highly, highly recommend this place for lunch, dinner, a snack, anything. 😂😂"
Swiss 2 Go,Sandwiches,"4306-118 Avenue Edmonton, AB T5W 1B2 Canada",AB,53.5706674,-113.407994,5,This place is AMAZING!! I have a large family with young children and usually I walk into a cafe like this and I can hear the groans from the staff. Not here!!! We were welcomed literally with open arms!!! EVERYTHING here is scratch made to the highest standards and the food is TO DIE FOR!!! The cakes are truly European and just like Europe each item is sculpted with love and pride! The flavors were incredible and worth every penny we spent!! The coffee was also perfect I had a latte and it was exactly what I was looking for. My kids had the biscotti and although they were a little pricy they were huge lasted my kids 2 days so I can't grumble. Seriously though if you're in the area and want a coffee and a cake come here it's worth it!!!

I was expecting it to be busy on Sunday early afternoon, there were only a few people. The atmosphere wasn't welcoming. The employee wasn't friendly, he seemed impatient while I was browsing through the menu and bakery.
I heard of this cafe because of their famous cheesecake cup, so I ordered 1 to take home. I was shocked about the price, it was $20 for a little cheesecake?! Oh well, I still want to try and see why it's so famous.
That's the only one I bought, who knows how much it costs to buy other products.
I tried the blueberry lemon cheesecake, it tasted good, not super sweet like North America cheesecake. But it is dense and heavy, I only can have a few bites.  Then another few bites for the next day.
I think the products are over price, even tho they might be from oversea, but still."

Delicious sandwiches are 'out of the park' awesome. These sandwiches seriously defy gravity and logic. How can a sandwich piled so high with ingredients not become a mess on the plate? Everything holds together and i think the pretzel bun puts this meal on another level. I wish they still offered my favorite sandwich ( san rosa i think it was called ) that had swiss dry cured beef, hardboiled eggs, green apples and toasted nuts!! This is my shoutout in hopes of seeing it return😉 I love this place and go waaaaay out my local area to get swiss2go sandwiches. Special trips even🤣!! Cozy quiet shop to stop for a coffee and have one of the best sandwiches in the city."

The original plan was to eat at a different hot pot place, but we didn't make reservations so couldn't get in.  At least that is what our friends said, they may have decided for us that this was the place to go.  We eat together quite often... I call them my taste buds.

I am glad we tried this place, and it is now on my list of excellent places to eat and chat.

Ambiance:
I'm not a fan of the big fans above each table - but I understand why they are needed, as it keeps the humidity down.  That much boiling liquid is bound to create humidity, but the air wasn't humid.  We could speak at a decent volume.

To the point:
Condiments:
The sesame sauce was pretty good.  It is a good indicator if the the food is going to good.

Soup base:
No one at the table complained.  I like spicy food, and the spicy base was perfect.  Flavorful with the right amount of heat.

Meat:
The lamb, pork and beef melt in you mouth.

Follow up:
I was worried I gave a glowing review and it was just a once off.  It wasn't.    It is my new go to place: day or night.

If you reading this and thinking where to eat, don't take my word for it... try it."

As other mentioned in the reviews, don't let the exterior of the building deter you. Park and go inside, the atmosphere is completely a different one!

It is cozy inside, and there are a lot of options! Their staff are friendly. They bring you the menu and the options for your hotpot such as soup bases, noodles, meats, seafood, veggies, and more!

You cook your options right at the table, it is so much fun doing that! If you wanted more, you can always ask for more.

I tried other hot pot places, but this place still beats than any other ones!

Give this place a try! You won't be disappointed!"

Well priced and well portioned and serve all my favourite traditional and more westernized Chinese dishes. They are open pretty late too so it’s always an option! They are located by the hope mission and some freaky people do come by, but the server aunties are really good at handling them and escorting them out, if they come in, in the most curt and fastest way so it’s really more of a people show than scary in my opinion. The gan chow niu he, stir fried flat rice noodles with beef, are so goood as well as basically any chicken dish and the beef brisket hotpot, curry or regular. Also you get this surprisingly delisciousss pork bone and vegetable soup to start for free. Do give it a try"

Food was fresh, hot and always tasty. We tried a couple new items today. Both were very good, the 'wok hay' on the beef chow fun was in believable.

I have to say we were impressed to say the least. So affordable, never fails All Happy Family rocks!"

It's what I remember of American Chinese food from pre-2000.  They do it well. They also have the Edmonton famous ""Hot and Dry Chicken"" that went viral at their now closed sister outlet downtown called Chicken for Lunch.

Coco Deep Fried Chicken,Chicken Shop,"12620E - 132 Avenue Edmonton, AB T5L 3P9 Canada",AB,53.5922175,-113.5374592,3,"Decided to try this place because I'm a serious fried chicken fan.

Ordered a the three piece meal with fries and soy garlic dipping sauce.

*****Service gets five stars
*****Hot fresh fries get five stars
*****Coleslaw (creamy with a touch of sweet) gets 5 stars
***Fried chicken gets three stars

Two of my three pieces of chicken were hot and juicy and had good crispiness (drumstick and wing) but the centre breast piece was a bit dry. Overall my main criticism is that the chicken didn't have much flavour. I expected to taste the herbs and spices, but it was a bit bland. Without the very tasty dipping sauce the chicken was underwhelming.

How does the chicken stack up against other places I've tried in the Edmonton area?:

#1  Mary Brown's (chicken and taters are fabulous)
#2  Swiss Chalet (when they have fried chicken available)
#3 Coco Deef Fried Chicken (its good, with quality sides, but a bit bland without the dipping sauce)
#4Jolibee (salty, but crispy and juicy; it's ok)
#5 Churches Chicken (kind of plain tasting, sides are meh)
#6 KFC (ok if served fresh, but that's rarely the case)
#7 Popeyes (not very good)

I will give Coco another try when I'm in the area."

Chicken has always been my comfort food, and they did satisfy my craving.  Best of all, they serve rice :-) Parking won't be a problem. Maybe it needs work on the interior design of the place to make it more appealing and inviting to eat. A personal favourite is the Snow Cheese and Honey Buttered Chicken. Staffs of the restaurant are very accommodating. Two thumbs up."

At my last visit, the staff took my order quickly and I didn't have to wait long for it to be ready. This is consistent with previous visits too. The sauce flavours are delicious, I especially like the garlic soy, and the chicken is juicy and tender with a delicious crunchy coating. It's not close to me so I don't have it often, but when I'm in the area I definitely stop by. I was just there recently and nothing has changed"

The down sides are : majority of chicken pieces are drums & wings 9/12 pieces , large fries is small. It’s comparable to everyone else’s medium at best. And last, they want you to order through their own App which is a pain to use. You have to wait for a code to be text to you to finish your order. There is also a user fee.

Little Bee BBQ HK Cafe,Hong Kong Style Cafe,"13823 127th Street NW Edmonton, AB T6V 1A8 Canada",AB,53.6011408,-113.5399718,2,"Last minute decision to eat Chinese and it was the only place open later than 9pm in the north end. Nice bonus that it's a HK style cafe. Unfortunately there was little to no HK cafe style food on the menu. So we refered to the online menu which had it all listed.
Our food was really tasty and portions a bit skimpy but the prices were ridiculously high. $17.95 each for fried rice and fried noodles and almost $13 for a noodle soup! The food was good but not good enough to justify those prices. This being the only legit Chinese restaurant in the north, I can see why the prices are what they are but this will only deter me from the northside for Chinese. I will stick to Chinatown to get great Chinese food at a fair price in the future."

Awful service and the worst noodles we've had in Edmonton."
Little Bee BBQ HK Cafe,Hong Kong Style Cafe,"13823 127th Street NW Edmonton, AB T6V 1A8 Canada",AB,53.6011408,-113.5399718,3,"One of the rare HK-style cafes located in the city. The seating and the atmosphere sort of makes you feel like you are in Hong Kong /Vancouver.

There is a huge selection on the menu which may take several visits to try. Price is fair and food quality is alright (can't compare to HK though).

The only drawback to this place was the service. They were a bit disorganized; the servers seemed confused at times, and we had to ask two different servers before our food finally came.

Bottom line: don't expect the servers to be extra friendly or personal. It might be a bit of a cultural shock to some, but the edgy serving style is actually quite normal among most Hong Kong style restaurants around the world."

Note to anyone considering delivery: It is $50 minimum for delivery, not the $35 for free delivery as advertised. Pricing makes it very awkward to order for 1 person. No delivery available for distances above 5km and the staffs were very uninformed. Dine in is okay for some nostalgia. Food is not bad but price is high. However, I will never consider Little Bee for delivery in the future ever again."
Rebel Food & Drink,Wine Bars,"9112 142 Street NW Edmonton, AB T5R 0M7 Canada",AB,53.5260523,-113.5660494,5,"We ordered a some non alcoholic beverages, one called the Wannabe which used ginger beer as the base. There was some pomegranate syrup and Seedlip Groove 42 (a mediterranean style distilled non alcoholic spirit). Quite sour and extremely herbal. The second was Pulp fiction. This used grapefruit juice as a base with anise and cardamom syrup with a grapefruit moon garnish. Sweet, delicate and delicious.

Had the fries to start, the fresh ground pepper at table side was a lovely touch and I very much enjoyed the spicy house made aïoli.

For the main course we ordered the mushroom toast, house made spicy chicken soup, and breakfast with Tiffany (avacado toast with poached eggs).

The mushroom toast had an egg yolk on top of various pan fried mushrooms and seasonings. With the micro greens as a garnish I felt like I was transported to the forest floor. So beautifully earthy and wonderfully herbaceous. An absolute win!

The breakfast with Tiffany was filling and refreshing. A small mason jar of fresh fruit was a perfect palate cleanser.

Cool touch with the phone chargers tastefully hidden at the table."

Great atmosphere, happy hours, and delicious menu with lots of variety. The best part however, is definitely their hospitality. We went there yesterday for a birthday with twin babies and a toddler - and the manager and staff were incredibly accommodating. So awesome to have the option to still go to cool spots in the city that welcome families and allow us to dine out with kids in tow. Will definitely be back (and will be getting another slice of the confetti cake - delicious!)"

The staff are very outgoing and friendly and make the dinking experience great.

The food was great and reasonably priced with a great menu.

I would recommend stopping here for your next meal asap."

Portions are large and can easily be shared. The  Bar is well stocked and staffed. Given the proximity to the Coliseum and Expo Center and with K-Days, it was busy. On Sundays they close at 8pm; A take-out service is also available. Plenty of Oilers photos/paraphernalia for hockey fans in #YEG"

Started with the shrimp & grits, it was outstanding. Slightly sweet in spots, slightly acidic in others, juicy shrimp, crispy bits, it was a well executed dish.

The pork belly on the other hand was a bit of a miss. Now while the pork belly was perfectly tender and easy to eat, the skin was basted with what tasted of Cattlemans BBQ sauce and it was accompanied by what can only be described as bottle Caesar dressing. The white sauce needs to go. The little round cakes on the dish were very dry (for all 3 of us who ordered it out of our group of 7). Corn was fine.  Crispy puffy skin, no BBQ just flaky salt would have made this dish great....even just a little 5 spice seasoned salt on the meat.

Would definitely come back for the cocktail though."

I wasn't a huge fan of the steam buns. Wasn't enough flavour for me, but I have higher standards for Asian food.

The ceasar salad was delicious!!!

The Palate,Canadian (New),"462 Queen Street Fredericton, NB E3B 1B6 Canada",NB,45.9623621,-66.6419071,5,"I have been here on Friday night lately for a dinner with my supervisor and my friends at around 6 pm. My suggestion is that you should make a reservation before hand as the place can get very busy on Friday.

For lunch, I found it is quite busy from Monday to Friday as well. You may need to book a table ahead of time to avoid disappointment.

The food is good. They always have specials of the day, which is not on the menu. Ask for them, most of the time they are surprisingly very good.

The price is good for the food quality and services.

The parking can be tricky during during the day for Monday to Friday as you have to pay for street parking. If they are full, you have to drive one more block and use the city’s parking lot (paid) and walk back to the restaurant. The street parking is free after 5 pm from Monday to Friday and all day on the weekends and holidays."

I’ve lived in the maritimes for about 8 years and first time in Fredericton I’m a little surprised to find the best restaurant I’ve yet been to out east! The staff were so lovely and truly went above and beyond, the owner Jenny was very generous with her time to chat with me and share a bit about the place and her inspirations for the cocktails, and the food… wow! Nothing else to say really. Stunningly delicious and very memorable, even the small bites. I had the taco special which was phenomenal and the regular menu beef tostadas which were divine. All in all, truly a great experience. I will be recommending this place to everyone I meet!"

Each dish was made from extremely fresh (often local) ingredients.

Highly recommend the house pickles, beef tostadas and the brassica for appetizers. The portions aren’t that big but the flavours are!

For mains: The steak was a dream, and the pasta was cooked to perfection. I really enjoyed the salmon too, the potatoes that came with it had great flavour.

The dessert was unique, out of the three, I’d say that the home made peanut butter ice cream was the best, but the olive oil cake came a close second. if you are too full for dessert, you’d have to get their coffee. We loved it.

Staff were friendly and helpful, and we had a great time. A must try in this small town!"

The decor was like stepping back in time.  I enjoyed the cabin and would go back. The guy at the table next to me ordered a pancake and one pancake was the same size as the dinner plate. It was good value for the price. I had the steak and eggs.

I heard great reviews about the place, but my experience was not so great.  Very friendly staff.  Very run down and dirty.  The bathroom had what appeared to be old chip fryer finger tip deep grease in the grout lines of the flooring. You could wipe it out with your finger like it was placed there on purpose.  Old cabin feel and run down 2 very different things.  This place needs a deep clean."

Food is good, less sweet for the chicken balls might be nice.

They have many gluten free options, I wouldn't have guessed the pasta I had was gluten free, it was that good!! I asked about the spiciness level of the carbonara sauce and the waitress had them tone it back for me, it was perfect.

We packed up half of our entrees to go so we would have room for dessert, I'm so glad we did because the creme brulee was perfection."

Unfortunately, we ordered draft beer and it wasn’t cold. Wings were great but ordered the seafood soup and our bowls weren’t even half full and it lacked seafood, $15/bowl. When it was mentioned, we were told that that is a common complaint from other patrons.
Nothing was done to correct it, probably wouldn’t return.
Overall it was ok."

The Hilltop Maritime Tavern,Pubs,"1034 Prospect Street Fredericton, NB E3B 3C1 Canada",NB,45.941158,-66.668737,4,I ordered pan fried haddock with capers. It came with a nice medley of vegetables and probably the best mashed potatoes I’ve had in a while.   The veggies weren’t the usual frozen carrot and pea medley which was a pleasant surprise as well.  Full marks for the food but couldn’t give full credit as I found the price a bit steep.
Number One Noodle,Vietnamese,"1012 Prospect Street Fredericton, NB E3B Canada",NB,45.9416413,-66.6693417,5,"No.1 is amazing every time. The food is delicious and fresh, lots of flavour and always a great portion. The Tom yum soup is excellent, always get it with fatty brisket and noodles, my partner loves the curry noodles. The apps are incredible as well, hand made spring rolls and wontons and the sauces the pair with them are so good not your typical sweet and sour fair. I would recommend this place to any one who loves a warm, rich meal, little spice and a good size plate. The staff is so friendly and at this point now our orders and are so good to us.
Great for supper or lunch"

Nice portions. Only less one star bc staff took ages to bring or refill water, forgot to bring tea pot and extra cups- had to wait 15
mins to flag someone down to ask for extra tea cup. So- maybe they were new, but always good to make sure to follow up with customers mid meal not just come back at the end."
Number One Noodle,Vietnamese,"1012 Prospect Street Fredericton, NB E3B Canada",NB,45.9416413,-66.6693417,2,We had 2 main dishes and spring rolls delivered.

Number One Noodle,Vietnamese,"1012 Prospect Street Fredericton, NB E3B Canada",NB,45.9416413,-66.6693417,1,"Blatant discrimination from the boss woman. From stepping into the restaurant, to ordering, to having the food brought to my table, I was met with nothing more than a stern face and annoyed attitude, the small amount of eye contact i got were annoyed stares. Meanwhile, I'm sitting at the table observing how she acts with other guests (the two tables next to me, oh btw just happens to be white), and she's smiling, totally different tone of voice (softer), full eye contact, completely different demeanor. Note: I was not hostile or anything to her at any point in time.

The food is overpriced, and the taste is nothing compared to what I could get in Ontario, but not horrible. The place seemed clean."

My Swiss friend who is in love with Schnitzel said it was definitely somewhere he's going again. Lol!

They ran out of Weiss beer, which was kind of sad, but otherwise, everything was excellent and service was good!

It was really bad, especially the meat. I just ate a baked potato with sour cream as the turkey sandwich was too revolting. My partner had a steak and it tasted awful."

We had heard good things about this place, that it was a fancier option for sushi in Fredericton, and the price did reflect that, but what we received was not up to par and frankly odd and in some cases down right gross. I would steer clear of this spot, try Jay’s or Tamatachi….no one try to feed you whipped cream sushi."

From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed by the friendly staff and immediately impressed by the clean and modern decor. The menu had a wide variety of options, and I ended up trying the sushi and it was some of the best I've ever had. The portion sizes were good and the prices were  reasonable.

I always get my food as take out but the inside always looks very clean, warm and welcoming as well. My usual choice is the Shawarma Combo platter which comes with both chicken AND beef shawarma, salad AND rice, garlic sauce AND hummus as well as a pita bread. The cost is around the $20 mark after tax and is of very good value. Some add on highlights for me are the pickled turnips and home made garlic sauce to really add a pop of flavor. I've never once been disappointed by the food here and would absolutely recommend it to anyone. I've lived in Fredericton for 15 years."

The person who got my order the way drive me like this is the one an only lebanese restaurant in this planet, if you want you can eat if not get out. I dont recommend this place. I have been to Lebanon I tried most of the foods. I was glad when I saw this restaurant and stop suddenly to have some lebanese taste again. But this is not the place for that."

Oriental Pearl Restaurant,Chinese,"440 Kimble Drive Fredericton, NB E3B 0K5 Canada",NB,45.930055,-66.629274,5,"I recently ordered vegetarian food from Oriental Pearl and I must say, it was an exceptional experience! The restaurant offers a wide range of vegetarian dishes that are packed with incredible flavors. The ordering process was convenient, and the delivery was prompt, ensuring that the food arrived fresh and piping hot at my doorstep.

The quality of the vegetarian food was outstanding. Each dish was meticulously prepared with attention to detail, resulting in flavors that were both authentic and delightful. The menu boasted a diverse selection of vegetarian options, catering to different tastes and preferences.

I highly recommend trying their signature vegetarian dishes, such as the paneer tikka masala and the vegetable biryani. The paneer tikka masala was a perfect blend of succulent paneer and a rich, creamy sauce that was bursting with flavors. The vegetable biryani had fragrant, perfectly cooked rice with an exquisite mix of vegetables and aromatic spices, making it a true vegetarian delight.

The food was thoughtfully packaged, ensuring that it arrived in excellent condition. The portions were generous, and the prices were reasonable, considering the quality of the food and the excellent service.

Overall, Oriental Pearl stands out for its exceptional vegetarian dining experience, even when ordered for home delivery. The remarkable quality of the food, coupled with their warm hospitality, make it a true gem for vegetarian food lovers. I'm eagerly looking forward to ordering from Oriental Pearl again and exploring more of their delectable vegetarian menu. Highly recommended for all vegetarian food enthusiasts!"

The Dip Pool Bar & Grill,Wine Bars,"335 Woodstock Road Fredericton, NB E3B 2J2 Canada",NB,45.963051,-66.667736,1,"TLDR: Avoid this place at all costs!

It took us 15 minutes to get water. Drink orders wouldn't come for 20 minutes. Overall, appetizers and two drinks took 2 hours. Absolutely shocking service. Drinks were overpriced. An 8oz single Caesar was $11. We ordered nachos and the red pepper dip at the same time but finished the nachos before the dip arrived. The nachos were well garnished but soggy. We didn't get a second sour cream as initially ordered. We mentioned it to the waitress and she confirmed but it never came. The red pepper and spinach dip comes in a two oz bowl. I was under the impression the dip was a side at first. The kettle chips were fried in old oil and were soggy.

After ordering appetizers our menus were taken and we were never offered mains.

It is a great place to watch the sun but the cheap poolside restaurant vibe is counter to the elegance of the Delta. It's a completely contrasted experience with the Stmr which we love."

Not only do you get to enjoy the sunshine and a great view of the river.  You also get delicious poolside drinks, like the Strawberry Mango Daiquiri I thoroughly enjoyed.  AND a similar and equally delicious menu to that of STMR.36.  THEIR NACHOS, THO, PEOPLE. THEIR. NA. CHOS.  You can never go wrong with this spot.

***Update***  (Removed 1 Star from 2, because there is no option for 0)  2nd visit again my judgement
However about 10-15 tables available They decline to sit us for couples of drinks & nachos because we had no reservations. What I gather is this do not drop by unless you have a reservation.
Funny i was able to get a table from STMR36 first they welcome my business & they accomodate me as I sat & watch the crowd at Dip 7-8 tables were still empty as I was leaving after having my  quick meal & a drink.  Unable to capture full pic on the other side due to umbrellas were in the way"

Service: our server was young and served quick.

Ambiance: With slow music and just enough light on the background, the restaurant has a calm atmosphere. The rest rooms are clean."

Was confused by most questions. Brought me red wine instead of white. Asked for extra spice in my ramen got none. Had to basically go in the kitchen to flag her. Spice or no spice was so bland. basically just chicken broth... then a ton of chillis when i asked for spice with a over cooked egg and pork that was 80 percent fat. she forgot our chicken balls and didn't get any napkins. didn't cone to check if our food was ok. when we said it was not good at the ebd she didnt offer anything.

When the order arrived, I reminded her that i asked for no bacon and she was extremely sorry and took back the pizzas and got us new ones in a matter of minutes. The atmosphere and service was very nice so one little error like this can be neglected.
Cut to the end, when Emma brought the bill, she told us that her manger, Chevy took 3 pizzas off the bill which we didn’t even ask for. This is what you call good customer service and making sure that they leave with a happy face. Definitely recommend and will come back for sure!"

Handmade, hefty toppings and they don't spare on the cheese. Excellent pizza

The only lousy review is by someone who ordered what was lying around the kitchen instead of getting a real pizza. The pic she posted even looks kinda good..
Get an actual pizza and taste for yourself 👍"
Luna Pizza,Pizza,"91 York Street Fredericton, NB E3B 3N4 Canada",NB,45.9625122,-66.6440406,5,Hands down the best pizza in Freddy Beach in my opinion. Reminds me of old fashioned Montreal sloppy style pizza. Expect generous and copious amounts of toppings and a crust that’s always worth finishing.

Little did I know they were already pre cooked and stored in the fridge ready to be pre-heated. I was very disappointed and was hoping for a fresh slice. They did say they are half cooked.

Very thick cheese, wasn’t the biggest fan. Bacon was sliced not balls.  But the slices were big and the pizza sauce was alright."

Don’t get me wrong the place looks like a total dive. But the quality of the food is out of this world.

The staff are nice and the place was clean. (And that’s saying something since it’s next to a bunch of night clubs and bars)

Lots of great special pizzas for any dietary need. (Unless your lactose intolerant like me. But the upset tummy I got was well worth it for this pizza)"

I've been living nearby for over two years now and have never gone in because of two main reasons. 1, there are many restaurants in the area, I'm still making the rounds. 2, like many meat eaters, vegan isn't my go-to. It's not that I don't like it, it's like jazz. I never hate it when it's around, but I'll never go to it on my own. Not going here was a mistake!

It's very well designed and the staff are supremely friendly, but the food is of course the gem here. I never would have guessed the food here could pack such incredible and diverse flavours into their dishes. From the vegan burger to the walnut stew and the baklava, everything had us clamoring for more."

Food was excellent and traditional from my perspectIve of eating at authentic middle eastern restaurants.  The vegan twists to the dishes were excellent.  Tons of flavour and I suspect meat eaters would do well here too with the shawarma.

Update: My family has come here 3 years in a row as we road trip through Atlantic Canada. It is never a disappointment and seems to get better.  Below is the shawarma wrap,  the rice and green beans, and the tofu plate.  Super delicious,  as always.  This family run business includes very warm and inviting service. Pleasant people."

The bathroom toilet was leaking everywhere. Also there’s no AC so it was so hot we had to leave. This also made the smell even worse. Also the music was so loud you can’t hear anything.

Sweet Belgian Desire Cafe,Cafes,"23 Ashton Court Fredericton, NB E3C 0H8 Canada",NB,45.9438678,-66.6958718,1,"I have gone to this restaurant for over 6 years. I visited about a year ago, and I couldn’t drink my coffee as it tasted like Maxwell House. I figured it must have been an off day at the restaurant, as I expect high end coffee from a restaurant known for Belgian waffles, delicious and beautiful food. The last time I visited, I asked prior ordering what coffee they brew and I was advised Maxwell House, the cheapest coffee I can find in the stores. Very disappointed to say no to coffee with my breakfast.
The service was not what it has been known for… Needing to order and pay for your meal prior to the service being rendered? Am I at a fast food restaurant now? I like to be seated, take my time while seated to order the food at my own pace without a lineup waiting at the door. I always give a second chance, but after being served the cheapest coffee, having to order and pay like a fast food restaurant and the food being okay, I unfortunately will not return. If the coffee can become delicious again, and the service can be rendered at the table, only then may I consider returning."

I have read good reviews, but our experience was mediocre. They only offer half service, which is not ideal. I have asked for fresh orange juice and California Benny. I got a small glass of the Tropicana juice, not freshly squeezed (for $6.5.....) so that was a bit of a disappointment. My poached egg was slightly overcooked and hollandaise sauce was not exactly to my taste. But some people might find it OK?....?"

Sunshine Diner,Breakfast & Brunch,"7 Brookmount Street Fredericton, NB E3B 2J4 Canada",NB,45.9637405,-66.6624716,1,"We’ve been coming here for years and have loved the Sunshine Diner for a long time. Lately things haven’t been going well when we’ve been there. The last time we were there it took almost 60 minutes for our food to be delivered to our table after ordering. That was after waiting at our table to order for over 15 minutes. When we did get our food only two of the three of us got our food and the third person at our table had to wait another ten minutes to get their food. When the food was delivered it was not the plate we ordered. Our sever was very apologetic but then it took even more time for the rest of our table’s food to arrive. Our food was below expectation as well. Our sausages were burned (obviously had been rush cooked in an attempt to catch up) and the home fries with onions were substantially burned too and had been cooked way too high. These plates should not have left the kitchen under any reasonable watch. But we are it and didn’t complain simply because we had waited this long. We were missing toast and our eggs were way too dry. The thing was is the restaurant wasn’t busy when we were there- it was 10:30AM on a midweek day and there were plenty of empty tables (although they did have dirty dishes sitting on them for a long time). I think some attention needs to be given to how the ordering and cooking processes go and some effort needs to be made to make the dining experience a lot faster and better for patrons. Oh, and on top of everything else some of the staff were having a pretty heated argument in front of customers. We will be back I’m sure, we just hope things can improve."

The food is always home-cooked with love. The staff are always more than amazing. They are so hard working and happy. I've been coming here through all different stages of my life and The Sunshine Diner makes my heart feel like Sunshine. Thank you today for the wonderful cold plates I put in for take out. Thank you for making my day today as I sat there waiting for my order the smiles, the laughter, the love I could feel it all. I thank you for being you♥️🌞 You make the world a better place by being in it!!!!

Big group or small they do it all!
Sunshine Diner,Breakfast & Brunch,"7 Brookmount Street Fredericton, NB E3B 2J4 Canada",NB,45.9637405,-66.6624716,4,"Friendly staff and a quintessential diner experience.

I've been here a few times and it's always the same. Everything they make is comfort. Whether it's with family or just dining alone, their all day breakfast is great. I keep saying I'll get other things on the menu, and have once or twice, but their breakfasts are great.

This time around I had the Really Big Breakfast. Everything is what you would expect from an old school diner style restaurant. Nothing fancy, but all comfort and nostalgia. Couple that with all you can drink self-serve coffee and tea, and you can spend quite some time in here. It's also often busy so don't expect to rush in and out. It's the perfect lazy weekend morning kind of spot."
The Coffee Mill,Breakfast & Brunch,"1187 Smythe Fredericton, NB E3B 3H4 Canada",NB,45.9430778,-66.669696,5,"They had a lot of empty tables when I went around 2.00 PM still waited for close to 10 minutes to get seated (God knows why). Food was good, enjoyed it and was tasty. Seafood chowder had less seafood and more lettuce but the waitress was kind enough to top it up with some shrimps and scallops so no complaints. They had good varieties on the menu so probably would repeat.

Repeated. Service was really good and so were all the items ordered. The place was crowded and had to wait for 15 minutes before we could go in.  These guys should seriously think about setting up some space for their customers to wait rather than making them stand in queue in cold winter."
The Coffee Mill,Breakfast & Brunch,"1187 Smythe Fredericton, NB E3B 3H4 Canada",NB,45.9430778,-66.669696,1,I ordered for a HOT CHICKEN and a Pineapple & Mango smoothie. although I didn’t know all the items in the food and I asked the lady to explain the difference to me and another sandwich that was on the menu but the food I got wasn’t appealing to the eye and the server who attended to us who I believe goes by the name Diane was quite dismissive & in a hurry. I also didn’t get my smoothie which was meant to go along with my food. I had to remind her after she brought the bill. I barely ate the food because it didn’t look good. I am completely disappointed with the service I got it was definitely a sub par.

The food is amazing with fresh ingredients and you can taste that its cooked with passion and love. I really like the ordering style where you can get 3 different dishes so you can try a little bit of everything!

The portions are generous and the prices are way way worth it, I always tip extra because I feel like its worth so much more:) It makes me happy to support someone local and so passionate about what they do.

See you soon and thank you so much Hana !"

and Hannah is sweet.

P.S. You should advertise on university campuses (e.g., flyers, etc.) because I would've eaten here almost daily throughout my degree, but I didn't know it existed because google restricts my search results -- and presumably those of other students -- to restaurants on the southside, unless I manually adjust the map."

Bulgogi,Japanese,"459 King Street Fredericton, NB E3B 1E5 Canada",NB,45.9616314,-66.6426017,4,"Overall a good place for some Korean food.

The we had the Beef Bibimbap and a Spicy Salmon roll.

The beef Bibimbap was spot on. Even proportions of beef veggies and a nice sunny side egg on top. I added the spicy red sauce on top to make it nearly perfect. The meal was filling and tasty.

Other nice touches were the wide metal bowl.

The sushi roll though was less than stellar. Not bad by any means but not good. Especially considering the price.

The location is a bit expensive as well considering the roll size and lack of Korean side dishes.

The restaurant itself is well kept and decor I found was pleasant. Location is good as well being located downtown."
Bulgogi,Japanese,"459 King Street Fredericton, NB E3B 1E5 Canada",NB,45.9616314,-66.6426017,5,"Wow. Brings back such fond memories of my years in Asia. As soon as I took the first bite of my Bibimbap with jeyuk, a spicy pork, it instantly took me back. I also had their kimchi jigae which is a kimchi soup. They even had the purple (black) rice that is well known in Korean dishes. Delicious, authentic Korean food. The portion was so large that I'll be able to have some for lunch tomorrow too! The food had just a bit of spice to it which added a nice kick. Such colourful and flavourful food and friendly staff. They currently only do delivery and pickup through Skip the Dishes."

I truly love the pizza but I am not a fan of rude employees and delivery drivers who bad mouth customers. This is my latest experience. If your delivery drivers are going to vent about the frustrations of their job don't allow them to do it rudely in front of paying customers. All i wanted was a pizza. Be more professional and perhaps someday i shall return. Have a great existence.

And talking about the place, it was a very delight-full experience to say the least. The pizzas tasted authentic and flavourful. The dipping sauce and cheesy bread was a cherry on the cake.

We ordered a party size pizza and garlic cheese fingers for takeout which cost $60 odd . Since I had never had an issue with their food I did not open the boxes to check prior to getting home. When we opened the box we were all unpleasantly surprised to see an over cooked partially burnt pizza. My husband, who says he has never had a bad pizza could only eat one piece. I will certainly think twice before ordering from Pizza Delight again. Very disappointed."

Everything I have ordered has been delicious but the Pad Thai is my personal favourite, containing a savoury sauce and perfectly crunchy vegetables.

I refuse to order Pad Thai at any other restaurant because the Thai Spice version is simply unbeatable."

I had an incredible experience thanks to the amazing manager, Bianca. She went above and beyond to ensure that my St Burger was absolutely amazing. The staff were incredibly friendly, and I was impressed by the spotless cleanliness of the bathrooms. The icing on the cake was the cold and refreshing fruitopia (as it seems there’s a shortage everywhere else).

Rôtisserie St-Hubert,Chicken Shop,"22 Trinity Avenue Fredericton, NB E3C 0B8 Canada",NB,45.9299566,-66.6646002,1,"Very disappointed of that location. I have uploaded a picture so everyone can see how bad the food quality you get at this location.

First we ordered 2 “St-hubert poutine”. When we got home, there was NO cheese in both poutines. (So we added some square pieces at home). Second, the chicken was so dry, that even the WATERED DOWN gravy (that wasn’t gravy, just tasteless brown sauce), they give you couldn’t soften the batter. Lastly, the fries felt so old that even the microwave could make them softer.

I do not recommend this location to anyone. And it’s a shame for the prestigious St Hubert brand unfortunately."

If you’re looking for lunch for a conference or staff party, look no further these folks have it handled. Whether it’s the wonderful attitude from the lady on the phone taking your order or the kind smile from the restaurant manager himself delivering it to you, they go above and beyond. To top it all off the meals are always delicious and never anything wrong or missing, they get it right.

An unexpected but pleasant surprise for something that didn't even bother me in the first place. Great service gave it the extra star. It's always great for those times when you just don't want to cook. Obviously not the healthiest option or the best pizza in town, but it's there when you need it and consistent.

So, I decided to check out their new melts. Didn't get to try one - pretty much trying to charge you $8.99 for two slices of pizza. Box is HUGE! MELTS ARE tiny. To describe a ""melt"", it's a slice of pizza with toppings with a piece of pizza crust placed on top then ""fried"". I know..I know .. things are expensive - but some things I'll just walk away from. ""MELTS"" are one of them. (I think I may have done it for $6.99 - $5.99 for sure)."

The Subway worker at the time immediately and without provocation, assumed we were homeless and was acting hostile as if we were attempting to loiter and or steal. If you as much as bring a single bag to this establishment they will treat you with very little to no respect, likely even hostility. Even after we had paid and eaten our food, and cleaned up after ourselves, the worker was staring us down with judgment as we exited. There are many amazing locally owned and ran restaurants in Fredericton, but NEVER go to this one. Definitely not worth even considering."
Subway,Sandwiches,"349 King Street Fredericton, NB E3B 1E4 Canada",NB,45.9629077,-66.6447819,1,"Not one to usually complain, but I went to subway on king street this evening around 8, I was treated like a inconvenience,  my sub was thrown together , not even cut. I was told there was only spinach, tomato and lettuce for veggies ( I could see all of the containers full sitting on the back counter) everything was already being put away. Keep in mind they don't close until 9pm. It's a Wednesday evening still lots of people downtown."
Subway,Sandwiches,"349 King Street Fredericton, NB E3B 1E4 Canada",NB,45.9629077,-66.6447819,4,It's always my goto place and I think rare healthy option.
Subway,Sandwiches,"349 King Street Fredericton, NB E3B 1E4 Canada",NB,45.9629077,-66.6447819,5,Wish it was open after 9 pm at least until 10 pm.
Subway,Sandwiches,"349 King Street Fredericton, NB E3B 1E4 Canada",NB,45.9629077,-66.6447819,4,"I feel bad for this Subway, I really do. The staff are friendly, for the most part, but they get overwhelmed easy. At lunch time, that place can pack up fast and it always seems like they’re understaffed. I would have given 5 stars if I could consistently go in and get quick service."

Subway,Sandwiches,"1111 Regent Street Unit 4 Fredericton, NB E3B 3Z2 Canada",NB,45.9409085,-66.6575497,1,"The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced at a Subway. Ordered online for pickup, and all 4 subs were made incorrectly when we got home and opened them up.  Some excuse that they had no chicken, so made us a club instead.  Next visit and excuse,  we have no ham! Kid goes on to describe how he is not allowed to prep any ham 30 minutes before close because he has to fold all the pieces and fill a container. If you want consistent quality and experience, go to Prospect St.....do not waste your money here."
Subway,Sandwiches,"1111 Regent Street Unit 4 Fredericton, NB E3B 3Z2 Canada",NB,45.9409085,-66.6575497,1,"Waited forever in line, they seemed to be understaffed. It was really unclean behind the counter and a lot of the food & veggies looked old. The real problem was the hair in my food!! so unsanitary and gross."
Subway,Sandwiches,"1111 Regent Street Unit 4 Fredericton, NB E3B 3Z2 Canada",NB,45.9409085,-66.6575497,1,"Went in at 4:40 pm and asked if she had tuna, the girl working replied with ""yeah we have it but it's not the best"" I looked down to see crusty old tuna, she never offered to make more. She just shrugged it off and we opted out on eating there, if that's not up to date then what else is bad?. Gross. Not to mention there was only one other lady in front of us so she wasn't busy."
Subway,Sandwiches,"1111 Regent Street Unit 4 Fredericton, NB E3B 3Z2 Canada",NB,45.9409085,-66.6575497,1,I give 1 star because everytime i go the driveway line time estimated is the equivalent of going to a restaurant and sitting down. They need to open there doors.

Subway,Sandwiches,"245 Bishop Drive Fredericton, NB E3C 1B1 Canada",NB,45.9463371,-66.6846901,2,"It just seems like they don't care, and they always seem to put less and less meat on your sandwiches when you go there. I remember going there, and I get rotisserie chicken, and I swear to God. There was one tiny little scope on a twelve inch sub it wouldn't even go end on this sub."
Subway,Sandwiches,"245 Bishop Drive Fredericton, NB E3C 1B1 Canada",NB,45.9463371,-66.6846901,4,Kind of a random location that I can't imagine walking to. The staff were very friendly and the food was carefully prepared.
Subway,Sandwiches,"245 Bishop Drive Fredericton, NB E3C 1B1 Canada",NB,45.9463371,-66.6846901,5,"Fast, food is good, orders never get messed up. Have gone here multiple times recently with zero issues.
It is advisable to come here instead of the Prospect location, if you can. It is much faster and not that much further of a drive.
The only issue is that it is a bit out of the way, but that has nothing to do with the review."

Pine Tree Pub,Breakfast & Brunch,"185 Gabriel Drive Fredericton, NB E3A 5R8 Canada",NB,45.9862163,-66.6214084,4,"Had the fish and chips and the fish was delicious and it was a nice big portion, would be nice to have a slice of lemon on the plate to go with the fish but I supposed I could've asked. Fries were not really crisp and could've used a pinch of salt but the portion was also plentiful. Very friendly staff and fast service. Dining room was very clean."
Pine Tree Pub,Breakfast & Brunch,"185 Gabriel Drive Fredericton, NB E3A 5R8 Canada",NB,45.9862163,-66.6214084,2,"All food was cooked from frozen. Nothing is homemade and you can taste it.

Plates we had:
- spinach dip. Overcooked, cheese was dark brown on top. Decent flavour
- loaded potatoe skins. Grainy, dry, flavourless
- fish and chips. Fish was well battered and good. Fries had good texture but were not seasoned at all
- burger. Sauce was good. Patties were overcooked and not seasoned at all
- pie and ice cream. Not homemade and no ice cream despite the title
- all the dips or sauces come in individual plastic servings

Service: it took us 15 minutes to get water. We were offered lemons, they were forgotten. The waitress then noticed, said she'd grab some and didn't. Appetizers took 20 minutes to arrive then entrees only 5 minutes later. Pacing was poor and led to food stacking at the table in a half full restaurant. We had to ask for additional mayo for the fries three times. We had to place our dessert order twice.

To say this place is disappointing is an understatement. Bottom of my list for eats in Fredericton."
Pine Tree Pub,Breakfast & Brunch,"185 Gabriel Drive Fredericton, NB E3A 5R8 Canada",NB,45.9862163,-66.6214084,1,"This time they served me burnt toast, burnt bacon. Didn't come back to check on me for refills. Numerous trips, same result.
My order has been sent back wrong in multiple occasions, even after mentioning it to staff.
I've had to reorder meals I've already ordered.
Going to stop recommending this spot from now on."

A&W,Fast Food,"235 Main Street Main Street Plaza Fredericton, NB E3A 1E1 Canada",NB,45.9765813,-66.648805,5,Ordered a mama burger with cheese combo and onion rings and the burger was excellent - perfect condiments and that onion slice and pickles really hit the spot. They have the best onion rings in the city but they could reduce the salt throwing and still have a quality taste. And their Root beer should be sold in stores!
A&W,Fast Food,"235 Main Street Main Street Plaza Fredericton, NB E3A 1E1 Canada",NB,45.9765813,-66.648805,5,"Today I had a terrible day. I was exhausted from long hours at work, starving, and found out that I can't even come close to affording my medication. I was feeling really low when I came to this A&W. The worker at the counter (I wish I caught her name but I remember that she was wearing a medical alert bracelet) was absolutely wonderful! She was polite, patient, and showed exemplary service. I hope this message makes it to her because she really turned my day around. Thank you for your positivity!

Additionally, the food was delicious and came quickly, the prices are very reasonable, the space is incredibly clean (even the bathroom!), and this location has a great layout as well."
A&W,Fast Food,"235 Main Street Main Street Plaza Fredericton, NB E3A 1E1 Canada",NB,45.9765813,-66.648805,1,The food is pre-cooked.. who knows how long it sits there. When we went through the drive-thru it took no time for the person in there (looked as though there was only one person working)  to hand us our food.. he clearly didn’t cook it in the 30 seconds it took for us to drive to the window.  My son and I got food poisoning.
A&W,Fast Food,"235 Main Street Main Street Plaza Fredericton, NB E3A 1E1 Canada",NB,45.9765813,-66.648805,1,"Worst ever A&W
I was there and waited in the line. Chinese looking cashier just went inside without serving us. And she was behind cleaning an equipment. How rude to avoid a comoletely unknown person who is standing to do business. And no one took our order untill I ask them to take our order. Finally I ordered got my burger (as in the picture) so low in quality, not a pleasent presentation. These kids who are working know nothing about customer service, food serving. The worst ever A&W restaurant I have been in these three years of my time here in Canada. I am not recommending this to anyone.
Further, Restaurant is not tidy at all."

For being as large and as busy as it is it was surprisingly clean. The counter staff was super friendly helping me pick out donuts, and they made my coffee nice and quick. Only complaint was the state of their sidewalks, which were completely incased in snow and ice, making them impossible to use, but that of course is a seasonal issue!"
Tim Hortons,Coffee & Tea,"1189 Prospect St Fredericton, NB E3B 3B9 Canada",NB,45.9395792,-66.6609772,4,"Inside was slow to slower. Lots of new people not strategically placed (at register not a good call for rush hour). This added to the 90% of open mouth breathers lined up within two to three feet of each other (less than 10% wearing masks, and none on employees).  Yes on the high stars because I got in before the long anti-maskers line and new isn’t a bad thing. It reflects poor management.

The food?  Well, the pictures tell all. Although missing some icing that I wasn’t going to lick off the paper for, the donut was decent. The wrap?  Ewww the sauce. The breakfast wrap would do well without any sauce, let alone the glob in the center…took that bite and sorry team, I’m not suffering for you and spit it out. The tea was HOT (don’t put between your legs people!!). I found the Apple Cinnamon quite unique and tasty with a tad of sugar.

Oh myy!  The inside line is wrapping into the dining area. That’s some addiction when the line is uber long inside."

And talking about the place, it was a very delight-full experience to say the least. The pizzas tasted authentic and flavourful. The dipping sauce and cheesy bread was a cherry on the cake.

We ordered a party size pizza and garlic cheese fingers for takeout which cost $60 odd . Since I had never had an issue with their food I did not open the boxes to check prior to getting home. When we opened the box we were all unpleasantly surprised to see an over cooked partially burnt pizza. My husband, who says he has never had a bad pizza could only eat one piece. I will certainly think twice before ordering from Pizza Delight again. Very disappointed."

Pizza Delight,Pizza,"989 Prospect Street Fredericton, NB E3B 2T7 Canada",NB,45.9431043,-66.6700326,1,"Absolutely the worst pizza I have ever had in 40 years. Just moved to Fredericton and thought we would try it out. The sauce was a Ketchup/BBQ sauce watery mixture, and the toppings had absolutely NO flavor whatsoever. The meat looked & tasted like it was from one of those subs you get in a variety store and put in the microwave. We ate part of one, and threw the second one in the garbage. I can't believe people put up with this and actually eat their pizza. I had to give it a star just to post, otherwise I would have given it a -11 (that's negative eleven)."
Pizza Delight,Pizza,"989 Prospect Street Fredericton, NB E3B 2T7 Canada",NB,45.9431043,-66.6700326,1,Service and food was good. But the dining area was too hot to sit. They must have their Ac working properly.

Do you know, The first Greco Pizza restaurant opened in 1977 in Moncton, New Brunswick as Greco Donair...and Pizza. In 1981, the franchise rights were sold to Grinner's Food Systems Ltd. of Truro, Nova Scotia.[1]

Many Greco locations in rural areas are known as ""Greco Express"" outlets; they are typically associated with a motel, convenience store, or other existing establishment. In some locations, the Greco franchise is associated with a Captain Submarine franchise, another of Grinner's properties."

I called at 3:30 and they had it done in ten minutes. The guy was super nice and talked to me a bit before he gave me the pizza. Honestly super impressed with Greco. It also tasted great!

Talked to Greco customer service about an awful experience I had at captain sub on sunset drive. They sent me multiple emails apologizing and even sent me a gift card! The pizza was great and their customer service at the local and chain level are both immaculate. Greco really seemed to be stepping up their game"

Spent 20 minutes in the drive through with 3 people ahead of us…the first vehicle had a drink and sandwich, the next two had drinks only as did we. I can be patient when things are busy or staffing is short but the two at the window could not have demonstrated a poorer work ethic.. To the young fellow who told me it had only been 20 seconds….you’ve got a lot to learn about customer service."

I asked why they charged extra and it was because the bagel cost more but I wanted the regular bread. Didn't want to switch foods because I'm sure it wasn't available. The cravable was also poorly made. An excess of sauce was flowing out of the bagel hole and the beef was loosely coming out of the sides.

Gave great recommendations which we happily followed. We ordered the lobster roll, shrimp pasta, fish cake, and a salad. All were made well and tasted delicious! The portions were great — didn't leave you wanting but you didn't feel overwhelmingly full. Dessert was decadent without it being too sweet. Overall a really great time here."
The Bicycle Thief,Italian,"1475 Lower Water Street Halifax, NS B3J 3Z2 Canada",NS,44.6431546,-63.5689192,5,"Probably the best overall restaurant experience I've had in a long time. The food was incredibly delicious. The pistachio crusted salmon was a hit! I'm not a big huge salmon lover but this dish just made me fall in love with salmon! From the succulent taste and moist flavour of the salmon to the crusty pistachio, the emotion and love put into this dish was truly amazing. My wife had the lobster pasta. If you could only see the emotion she had after the first bite, you could say that her food adventure journey into finishing this dish was just the beginning. We ended our dinner with dessert and that too blew our minds! I can't even get into the amazing dinner service we had! Joshua made us feel at home and made sure everything was perfect! Almost felt like he was family! That's how amazing this restaurant is... The vibe, the people, the food was truly incredible. My wife and I can't wait to come back! Truly an amazing experience! I would recommend this restaurant from here to the moon and back! Cheers! 🍻"
The Bicycle Thief,Italian,"1475 Lower Water Street Halifax, NS B3J 3Z2 Canada",NS,44.6431546,-63.5689192,5,Amazing food and really nice atmosphere as well as top level service. All the food has its own distinguished flavor but the most impressive is the rice with scallops. The rice is soft and kind of milky and the scallops are strong. If it is less salty then it will be the best main dish I have ever.
The Bicycle Thief,Italian,"1475 Lower Water Street Halifax, NS B3J 3Z2 Canada",NS,44.6431546,-63.5689192,5,We stopped by during our Royal Caribbean cruise vacation. This place did not let us down. The food is spectacular and well seasoned. The portions are amazing and the quality and taste deserve a 5 star rating. We had mussels for the appetizer. For the main course we had the lobster pasta and the lobster roll. And for the dessert we had the butterscotch cake. We recommend them all. Great atmosphere too. It was a great day to sit outside.

The drinks we well made and the table service were good. The location was great and right at the water.
My only criticism was that the bathroom looked like a tornado blew through it. There was no paper towel in the dispenser, the facial tissue was soaked and the floor/counter was soaked too. I made a mention of it when I used the washroom earlier in the meal, but it was not addressed for the whole meal. I expected more at the restaurant of this caliber."

Our waitress Kathleen was super and was always coming back to check on us and make sure that every bite was delightful .   We even made sure to save room for dessert because if you have not yet tried it their deep fried ice cream and their brownie ice cream dessert were amazing .

EDNA Restaurant,Canadian (New),"2053 Gottingen Street Halifax, NS B3K 3B3 Canada",NS,44.6514645,-63.5823011,5,"Incredible experience!
We had expected a lot from Edna as several of our friends had mentioned it for our trip to Halifax. Without a doubt, this place delivered. We were seated along the windows at the front of the restaurant, allowing us to watch the foot traffic on the lively street. The restaurant is long and has a wonderful wood and brass arch anchoring the room and housing the seated bar.
We started with tuna poke and fried oysters. Both were fantastic. We shared the scallops and striped bass for mains. Both completely amazing dishes. The scallops had squash of all kinds, prepared in a several different ways. Bringing some savoury to the dish was cubed, fried ham bits. The bass was the special and came together nicely with bok choy, creamed kale, and baby red potatoes. It was mouth-watering. Just incredible.
The portion size was sensible and we had little room for dessert. We managed to wrap our lips around a sticky toffee cake served with black sesame ice cream. Unreal.
Our server was extremely mindful and friendly. With great suggestions from the menu (and things to do around town), our experience was made complete by the outstanding service.
You must eat here if you are in Halifax."

We came in for lunch and the food was incredible all around. The service was friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating to my friend’s gluten intolerance. Not to mention this restaurant is GORGEOUS!

We came in for an early dinner after a recommendation from a friend and we were not disappointed. The staff were all lovely and extremely attentive. Service was fast and we had food at the table very quickly which is appreciated when travelling with a little one. We enjoyed the steak tartare and crispy Brussels sprouts to start - loved them both, especially the vinegar in the Brussels. Our little one enjoyed the trout which was juicy and topped with a lovely parsley salad. The dish that stole the show and our hearts was the steak - wow. It was served with fingerlings, mushrooms and a pea purée. Absolutely delicious. We will be dreaming about this until our next visit. Thank you for a lovely and memorable evening!"

I have my daughter the choice between three of the top ten brunch places in the city. She picked The Canteen on Portland and everyone was happy. The Benny's were amazing. Get the lobster, it's worth it. The French toast was the best ever, not too sweet, just right. Everything was excellent. The food was complimented by the service which was just right. The atmosphere was ok, not great but we did like the art. We had a great experience and will be back."

Well worth the (quite enjoyable) ferry ride, the Canteen combines atmosphere, care, affordable prices and fine dining. 3 people suggested I take the short ferry ride from Halifax to eat here - and I now understand why! The brussel sprouts are simply heavenly, combining an orchestra of flavors that only gets better with  each bite. As a complete beginner with oysters, I was blown away with how fresh the Canteen's oysters were. Not 'slimy' in the slightest, I enjoyed them with a squirt of lemon juice, although the house mignonette was fantastic as well. My server, Mark, was immensely professional and deeply cared about providing a SENSATIONAL experience!! He offered fantastic pairing suggestions, created special cocktails and coffees based on my tastes, offered sound advice on the menu, and truly cared for the clientele. I wish I could give the Canteen 10 stars! A stop you simply cannot miss in Halifax, whether you are visiting for a few days or a local. *I highly recommend making a reservation!! The place is well- known all over the country for its fantastic dishes, but I was easily able to secure a table the morning of! The prices are quite reasonable, but I enjoyed an appetizer, entrée, dessert, 3 cocktails and a specialty coffee!"
The Canteen,Sandwiches,"22 Portland Street Dartmouth, NS B2Y 1G9 Canada",NS,44.6646068,-63.5675286,4,"Food was fresh and delicious, albeit a bit pricey. Definitely worth a trip on a splurge day. Recommend reserving a table in as much advance as you can as you usually can't get one for the day of / walk-in, in my experience. They also don't open until 5pm for dinner so be mindful of the weather because you won't be getting in sooner."

Might give the slight edge to the crobster roll, but my wife chooses the risotto...  Just a sign that Everything on menu is worth ordering.

The food was Incredible! The Buttermilk biscuits with molasses butter was a beautiful appetizer. I had the Kale Caesar salad with chicken and I loved EVERY BITE. Both of these paired well with the Pop shop-inspired mixed drink I had. The dessert - maple creme brûlée - I could have married that. The atmosphere was fantastic, and the music wasn’t so loud that we couldn’t have a simple conversation. 100% recommend, and will return."

The ambiance of the restaurant is great, not overly bright, very clean, appropriate decor for a romantic night out or a lovely gathering with friends around food and wine. The food was delicious. My wife said it was one of the best gourmet burgers she's ever had. They have a fair selection of local libations to choose from at reasonable prices for this type of establishment. Our wait staff was great, Kyle in particular was very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back."

I grabbed a lager as we were deciding what to order.  My wife decided on the Thai bowl and I had the seafood chowder with molasses bread. The chowder was good and so was the beer.  My wife didn't finish her bowl because the flavor was just too overpowering. She struggled past the third bite. I was good, just too much of it. The servers seemed to be somewhat new, but they were good and made it an excellent experience. This is the second time we have frequented this location and will return for sure."

We had the Old School Smash Burger and added bacon. We also had parm fries as the side and they were delicious. We also had the seafood chowder.

Modern Orchid,Asian Fusion,"171 Hector Gate Dartmouth, NS B3B 0E5 Canada",NS,44.7057297,-63.5622905,5,"Best Asian food I've had in a long time. Ordered the Dinner for Two (B) and every dish was amazing. The flavors were wonderful, it was much better than any other Asian restaurant I've been to recently. Wonton soup alone is worth coming back for. Servings were huge too.
The service was great, staff were very friendly and quick to refill waters.
Doesn't look like much from the outside, but once inside it has lots of traditional Asian art and decor. The fish tank was clean and not overstocked, which is great to see. The music was in Chinese (I think) which is another nice atmospheric touch."

The cashew nut chicken was amazing, and it came with a perfect little spring roll and perfectly cooked rice. There was a bit of zip to the chicken and vegetables, but not too much that I couldn't enjoy the flavours. After my meal, they brought me a nice little bowl of chocolate ice cream, free of charge.
5/5 recommend."

I ordered through skip the dishes and got the chicken lettuce wraps, a veggie spring roll, and a pork spring roll to try. The lettuce wraps were absolutely delicious and made a perfect lunch, but the filling was really liquidy so they were definitely messy to eat. The spring rolls were great as well- I would recommend the meat spring roll! The veggie spring roll was a little lacking in crunch and flavour but still nice. The sweet and sour sauce is yummy as well. I will definitely eat here again!"

Ordered a Fried Chicken and a Mushroom Hoagie along with the Jupiter Cocktail and a Mocktail. The chicken sandwich was fine but we were left a bit disappointed with the Mushroom Hoagie. The fries were good too. The cocktail was excellent.

Hope they improve upon the vegetarian/vegan menu but otherwise alright."

The staff are extremely friendly, the decor panders to a mix of geek cultures in a maximalist and playful way, something both my boyfriend and I really enjoyed, and the atmosphere felt extremely relaxed and comfortable for two easily overstimulated bar-goers, though we were there extremely early in the day.

Unfortunately we never had a chance to try the food, but the menu hits all the necessary classics and we hope to be back soon to try some!"

We sat down on the patio and, even though it was a chilly evening, we enjoyed the atmosphere.

We tried several different beers and, we definitely found a couple of favorites. The food was quite tasty, simple but, well executed.

Overall, service was also good, a little laid-back but, still responsive so, no complaints!"

The Korean pork tacos were excellent but a little messy. The cocktails I'd had before and were refreshing. Loved the chocolate tofu pie and was pretty full after.
The Wooden Monkey,Bars,"1707 Grafton Street Halifax, NS B3J 2C6 Canada",NS,44.6470352,-63.575259,3,"The seitan donair was really good 5/5 stars! And the roasties were really good too! The vegetarian special was not good, it tasted like left over food from yesterday. The pasta over cooked, cold and the “roasted vegetables” were just vegetables cut and thrown on the plate! The fish cakes would be a 3/5 nothing crazy…. The garlic “pizza” was small but it is what it said it was.
Overall pretty decent restaurant but the portions didn’t really justify the price. The concept behind the restaurant is nice."
The Wooden Monkey,Bars,"1707 Grafton Street Halifax, NS B3J 2C6 Canada",NS,44.6470352,-63.575259,1,"Disappointed, again. This is the second and last time I’ll eat here, The food does not ring true to their mission statement of being locally sourced. It was bland and uninteresting, the ingredients were clearly not in house made and tasted like it came from a can. I had the eggplant parmigiana which was basically a piece grocery store eggplant roasted with cheese on top..

I don’t feel good about this review, and the food also made me feel sick.

The staff was delightful and I found that made the experience better.

Thanks"
The Wooden Monkey,Bars,"1707 Grafton Street Halifax, NS B3J 2C6 Canada",NS,44.6470352,-63.575259,3,"Attended here for a work lunch gathering a few weeks back. This was my first and likely my last visit. Our server was very friendly and attentive, the bright spot to my experience.
I ordered the Monkey Club with roasties as the side. The sandwich was underwhelming for taste and the bun it was served on was dry and crumbled in your hands. The roasties, which are their oven baked potato wedges, were nothing to write home about.
This wasn't the worst dining experience I've had, but it was far from memorable in a positive way. The product did not match up with the price and therefore I could not recommend it. I imagine it does well based on it's convenient location and it's accommodation to different dietary needs."
The Wooden Monkey,Bars,"1707 Grafton Street Halifax, NS B3J 2C6 Canada",NS,44.6470352,-63.575259,4,"Very good service with good food.  The reason for 4 stars is that it's good food but not great food.  We were a large group so we got a chance to try quite a few items.  Everything was decent but just lacking that little bit extra to out it over the top.  For ex, the scallops in the pasta were a bit over cooked.  The pasta itself was a bit underseasoned.  There were a good things as well, the brushetta was awesome, the caeser salad was pretty good and the pork loin tacos were good.  I think it's safe to say we enjoyed the appies more than the entrées."
The Wooden Monkey,Bars,"40 Alderney Drive Alderney Landing Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4W1 Canada",NS,44.6650787,-63.5698954,5,"The food was fantastic, and the service was even better. I don't think I've ever had such good service in a restaurant. Importantly, the server was very proactively helpful to one of our party at navigating the menu for a dietary restriction.
I ordered the scallop pasta. It was delicious. As feedback though, I think I'd suggest mentioning in the menu how many scallops are in the dish. As a tourist from a non-coastal part of Canada, seafood pricing in restaurants is unfamiliar to me. So despite how much I loved the dish and would recommend it, I may have chosen something different had I known how many scallops would be involved. Not a complaint, just feedback from a tourist who is still learning to ask before ordering when it comes to mouthwateringly delicious, fresh seafood.
Oh, and get the creme brule. It's worth it."

The menu is based off seasonal and local offerings so it may change based on the time of the year but you'll find veg and non veg offerings at pretty much anytime of the year.

If you're looking for a great date spot or just love good food, check out the wooden monkey!"

Go into the Market and follow signs for elevator. It's on the 2nd floor. I cannot think of a restaurant where I've eaten more/better to die for food. Everything was absolutely delish. Our waiter, Sam, was great. We sat outside on a chilly day, they provided blankets for guests that were cold. 10/10, find a way to make sure you eat here!"
The Five Fishermen Restaurant,Seafood,"1740 Argyle Street Halifax, NS B3J 2B6 Canada",NS,44.6477635,-63.5753053,4,"Great first night Halifax, glad we decided on this place. The atmosphere was excellent, and just the right noise level for us.

They were booked up and we didn’t have reservations so we sat at the bar. The staff at the bar were excellent, very friendly and knew when to chat and when to be scarce get seats if you have the chance.

We had the 5 Fish Experience and it was great, everything cooked perfectly, though I will admit the portion was a tad small for my expectation."
The Five Fishermen Restaurant,Seafood,"1740 Argyle Street Halifax, NS B3J 2B6 Canada",NS,44.6477635,-63.5753053,5,"This place is fantastic! Was a recommendation from a friend. We were only in Halifax for two nights but after enjoying it so much the first night we returned. We made a reservation and were seated promptly. The whole place had a great vibe with friendly staff and excellent music. Our server Sydney was excellent! She made several recommendations and was spot on with each one. The drinks we enjoyed were The South End (gin) and Tequila Mockingbird (Tequila) and they were delicious!

Food: Five Fishermen Experience, Arctic Char (was trout because they were out but was excellent), Oysters Rockefeller, Mushrooms Apps, Seared Scallops, Mussels, and Crab cakes. We did think the serving size of 3 very small scallops was a little lacking, but it tasted very good.

I felt like my stomach got a hug after eating here! So good! Would definitely go back next time we are in town."

Food was amazing (shrimp toast was delicious), staff were lovely and the restaurant is stunning. My spouse booked our reservation for our 6 year anniversary, they went above and beyond with a complimentary drink and even gave me a rose after our dinner. Unbeknownst to the staff he proposed that night on the waterfront and having the service and experience we did that night made everything more magical. Definitely a go for date night 🤍"
The Five Fishermen Restaurant,Seafood,"1740 Argyle Street Halifax, NS B3J 2B6 Canada",NS,44.6477635,-63.5753053,4,An upscale experience for sure but I don't know that the food necessarily deserved the same? Pricing felt a little too expensive for what was served. Regardless the food was tasty and well made. Service was quick and friendly. Our waiter was so personable which made the restaurant experience feel less formal - because we certainly weren't.
The Five Fishermen Restaurant,Seafood,"1740 Argyle Street Halifax, NS B3J 2B6 Canada",NS,44.6477635,-63.5753053,5,"Great beautiful modern lounge style dining experience.

Food was amazing. We had a delicious lightly dressed ceasar salad with pumpernickel croutons.

Our mains were a big bowl of mussels cooked it what tasted like a lightly sweet and savory french onion soup that paired well with the sour dough toasted bread wedges for dipping.

The other mains were the five fishermen experience had a very savory mushroom based mushroom risotto, and the scallop grenoblise had very plump, juicy tender scallops.

Our server was amazing, Laura. She was very accommodating, suggesting slight variations to the dishes to suit our taste, was also very friendly, attentive and had great attention to detail.

Definitely one of the best seafood places in Halifax, definitely worth the extra money!"

They had live music and the place was pretty busy. We were just able to snag a spot for 2. Despite the small size, the place didn't feel overcrowded. Service was quick and they had a good selection of drinks and bar food. The music was really good and the overall atmosphere felt very welcoming.

The Elliot Page vegan chocolate cake ( layered chocolate cake with creamy chocolate mousse) an absolute perfect end to the scrumptious meal…even if you share it (though you wouldn’t want to share it!)

Everything we ordered was so flavourful. It has many vegan options (the pics are some of the vegan options available). They also have gluten-free options!

They even have weekly events like Trivia, Open Mic, Live Music and Comedy evenings; though we didn’t make it for those."

The service however was very slow. The two women working the tables just sat behind the bar chit chatting. Several people sat there for 40min without being asked if they want their drink replenished.

I was hungry and googled “food near me” when I seen this place pop up. So, without second guessing I was on my way to try this place.

Immediately I was greeted and they took my order right away.
The staff were so friendly and helpful.
And the food was SO GOOD. If you’re looking for a good home cooked meal, this is the place to go!

I will definitely be returning when I’m back in Dartmouth for work!

I did a review on my TikTok if you want to see my reaction when trying the meal!

Everything tasted great and the service was great too !"

I think they had a sick call the last time I was there bc our server had way too many tables to give anyone good service (not their fault for sure). We made the best of the evening by making a joke about how we never got what we asked for or that all the tables around us sat dirty after people left (for 2hrs). I understand how hard it is to find service staff. If this had been my first time I could see not wanting to return. But this situation had never been the case before. Maybe have some grace for your server if you happen to have a similar experience. Maybe they'll be able to get their staffing issues sorted before the height of summer. Wishing them the best!"

Our favorites were the new lobster ravioli and the cheese and spinach manicotti... The lasagna was nice, each pasta produced with care. I would certainly go back again, bring a friend...

The breading on the fish was good. It was just the Halibut consistency I don't like.  My son got a burger and a side of sausages, which he enjoyed.  My wife got turkey BLT and onion rings.  We also got a shake, float and a waffle desert, all of which were quite good.  The shake comes in a glass but with the metal mixing cup like they used to do at some places I went as a kid.

Heather was out waitress, very nice and attentive.  Atmosphere was nice.  Could have used a Pinball table, but minor quibble.  If we get by again will definitely return."

Right off the jump, we were treated so well. The staff are outstanding; friendly, engaging and knowledgeable.

It wasn’t long before we turned the decision making over to them and boy, they made it wonderful.

We started with fresh oysters, shared their Burger Week offering and picked items from the Dine Around menu, having a veritable smorgasbord of deliciousness.

The dessert, oh my, what a treat. Hats off to the pastry chef.

Completely impressed with the cocktails they crafted for us. There is a lot of beverage experience & knowledge, coupled with passion in spades.

We will be back!"

The cocktails are always delicious and the food keeps us coming back again and again. If the atrium is too much for you they also have a study which is another dining area off the front bar. It's quieter and delivers a great alternative for those who may not want to sit in the atrium with the main bar and music.

The waitress was polite, friendly, and attentive.10/10."

Also very accommodating. I currently use a cane to walk so they seated us at ground level so I didn't have to go upstairs to the main eating area.
P.S. the pressed juice is delicious!"

The tomato soup and sandwich was delicious (and affordable, the whole menu seemed fairly priced). Also the bakery case was full of so many good looking treats, we tried one of the cheesecake slices and it was super yummy, big enough for two to share with plenty for each! We made reservations before coming but it was not too busy at all anyway around dinner time on a Thursday night. I hope to come again to visit the cafe!"

Pulled pork tacos were quite dry."

I was very happy with both when I stopped with my wife as we were on our way to the Halifax airport. My entree, chicken curry with grilled chicken strips over basmati rice, was excellent. A satisfying, full meal for an affordable price. Highly recommended!! The adjoining market, although small, offers some excellent bread, pastries, sweets, and various artisanal foods. There is a coffee bar as well."

I had a potato leek soup, which was very good, although I could have done without the pickled mustard seeds. One of my baguette slices was toasted beyond edibility but that was quickly corrected. My entree was a short rib, which was very, very rich. It was served with hasselback potatoes covered in a delicious sauce, and a broccoli cooked with olive oil, lemon, and salt. They were the best-tasting broccoli I've ever had, and one of the highlights of the meal.

My wife had halibut with ""French gnocchi"" which she loved, too. I had a few bites of the gnocchi and it was creamy and delicious."

This restaurant has an amazing staff and wonderful Mediterranean food. Our local family has been visiting this location for years. Cannot say enough good things! Started with the Mediterranean Trio and Risotto Balls. Had the Chicken Souvlaki with Greek Salad and Lemon Grilled potatoes. My goodness. This is reason enough to visit again and again!

Spanokapita was the best I've ever had fresh and hot.
The mousake was delicious but a bit cold they did not warm it enough. Service was amazing kind and promt"
Ela! Greek Taverna,Mediterranean,"150 Hector Gate Dartmouth, NS B3B 0E6 Canada",NS,44.7048688,-63.5614803,5,"Ela! Is probably in my top five favourite places to eat in Halifax/Dartmouth.
I recommend many appetizers including the spanakopita which was one of the best I have had ! or the Kopanisti dip, which also is one of the best I've had.
If sharing, the grilled platter is a great choice and includes Seftalia, pork souvlaki, two pieces of rack of lamb, two chicken breasts, a salad, lemon potato and a dip.
The lamb is always done perfectly.
The stuffed chicken breast is also a great choice, always so good.
The service at Ela! Is always great every time I go.
I recommend the ekmek or chocolate torte for dessert, actually some of my favourite desserts around !
Ela! Is a cozy, well decorated restaurant with nice traditional background music & a romantic feel of Greece. I love to eat at Ela!"

Went here yesterday for the first time despite always recommending it to people because a friend said it was the best. I decided to finally go myself and wow. The food was SO fresh, the falafels were the best I have ever had, and the crispy cabbage and pickled onions paired with them were so good. The atmosphere in the restaurant was very chill, quiet, and relaxing. The waitress was lovely."
Ela! Greek Taverna,Mediterranean,"150 Hector Gate Dartmouth, NS B3B 0E6 Canada",NS,44.7048688,-63.5614803,1,"Very poor experience. My sister and I visited this afternoon (Dartmouth Crossing location). My sister had had a Valentine’s Day dinner here and enjoyed it a few months ago. Today’s experience was night and day. We were seated promptly - good. Another server came over after we’d spent time with the menus, asked if we wanted something other than water, we didn’t. The server immediately turned her back and walked away without asking if we were ready to order. We were a little taken aback, but figured she’d be right back. She returned several minutes later, after making eye contact with us and immediately turning away to check on another table’s desserts. Seemed rushed and dismissive, even though there were very few people seated in the restaurant. We waited over 30 minutes for our meals. We were counting down to walking out when she came out of the kitchen.
The food was very lacklustre for the price. Calamari was over cooked and rubbery. Lemon potatoes tasted like they had been cooked in vegetable stock and nothing else. Greek salad was fine, but it’s hard to screw up a Greek salad. Pork skewer was very bland and under seasoned. Aside from the Greek salad, this was the most tasteless and unappealing Greek food either my sister and I have ever experienced. I had to go up and ask for the bill, as no one checked in on us after we received our meals. Staff were just standing around.
Poor service, meh food quality for a pretty inflated price, and an extended length of time waiting ensures neither my sister or I will ever eat at Ela! again, and I will very much recommend against dining there."

The Thai iced coffee was strong and sweet and my friends Thai iced tea was such a sweet and unique flavor. If you are in downtown Halifax or around the other location in Dartmouth you gotta go here for some of the best Thai food in Halifax."

They are visiting from Alberta and love seafood. The reviews seemed good so we decided to try it.  My sister in law wanted clams but they did not have any at that time. She ordered the seafood platter and they gave her an extra piece of fish and I think extra scallops.  I had a salad and the guys had fish and chips. The fish and chips were terrible.  Small pieces with way too much batter and the fries were frozen, not homemade.  The only thing that actually tasted good were the scallops.  So disappointed, I had high expectations.  I read the negative reviews after we ate there and they are similar to ours.  Owners please read the reviews, make some changes and this would be a wonderful place to eat.  We won't be back"

It’s been here for 7 years or so, (I was told) and I feel like it’s kind of hidden from sight on the opposite side of Finbar’s. (Probably why I didn’t notice it.)Their food is delicious and they have a lunch menu so it’s my new go-to when I don’t bring a lunch to work. I highly recommend upgrading to the beet salad and if you see the lamb shank is on special, I’d suggest getting it."

We had a table of 7 and noone left disappointed. The variety of appetizers and the main dish options gave us plenty to choose from and only two people ordered the same thing. I had the lamb kofte and it was so well seasoned and tender. My appie of hummus and ground lamb with the warm pita type bread was amazing. Our server really made the meal, he was very pleasant to deal with, knowledgable about the dishes and he just added to the whole situation.

I plan to go back soon with my 88 year young mother and will definitely be recommending to other family and friends. Don't delay like I did as I ended up regretting that I hadn't experienced it sooner. Well done USTA."

They provided some colouring and a kids menu and we all enjoyed a very delicious meal together.  Small warning that this is a semi fancy place, and while we were not dressed up (and had kids!) we also went a bit early to avoid the later celebration/romance/special occasion crowd.

Parents: this is a great place to bring your kids but be aware their meals come with only the entree, so drinks and dessert are separate (and definitely worth it!)."

My partner had the pizza which wasn't anything to write home about... Just okay.

I had the tortellini Al Prosciutto, it costed 24$ on the menu. I was expecting a big dish but I was served 12-13 peices of tortellini. That's the equivalent of 1.84-2$ a piece. I was pretty disappointed with the dish being this was advertised as a main course meal when this could easily be eaten as an appetizer. The pasta is hand made which I understand although it's nowhere near a dish being a main meal.

Drinks are alright (sangria and MIA)

The manager came to my table with a piece of cake on the house to go which was nice of her. Would of appreciated if they remade the dish to go being how little was served but I guess take what you can get right ?"

It’s been a around for a long time and was known to be fancy back when I was in high school, but over the years with all the new restaurants this place has kind of been forgotten.

The scallops, short ribs, octopus and cocktails were fantastic! The ceviche (was told it was new on the menu) needed more lime and salt but the fish was very fresh, after adjusting it it was great as well. The parsnip dessert was cute but just tasted like a spice cake, maybe go for the chocolate dessert next time…There will definitely be a next time! The Asian bartender/server also made dinner very enjoyable. Go with his recommendations!

Gosh those scallops…with a sweet creamy savoury sauce and perfectly cooked scallops… I’ll be dreaming of you 😂"

Gio Restaurant,Canadian (New),"1725 Market St Halifax, NS B3J 3N9 Canada",NS,44.6473304,-63.5761087,5,"Gio is considered a 4 diamond restaurant, and I can absolutely see why. Right from the moment we set foot into the restaurant, the welcome and attentiveness was impeccable. The menu is seasonal, so what you may see online in terms of menu may not match what's currently being offered. This means that the ingredients used are fresh and local, hence why the change in menu depending on availability.

All that to say that they chana masala (included in picture) I ordered was absolutely divine. The basmati rice was cooked to perfection, and the chickpeas were beautifully flavourful. But the stand out here was the homemade mango chutney - it was quite possibly the best chutney I've ever had.

Our server, Oscar, was a pleasure to deal with from the very first moment. Being also the main bartender, he was able to recommend some fantastic cocktails for us to try depending on what we were in the mood for. And the cocktails: on my! They're inventive, modern, and a pleasure for the sense! I'd highly recommend trying one!

All in all, an excellent place to dine with what I consider absolutely 'bargain' prices for a 4 diamond restaurant! Highly recommended!"
Gio Restaurant,Canadian (New),"1725 Market St Halifax, NS B3J 3N9 Canada",NS,44.6473304,-63.5761087,1,"Gio's pretensions far outweigh its delivery. Management needs to get a real chef PRONTO! It was perhaps the worst restaurant meal I have ever had, at the highest cost. I am 70 years old and have travelled around the world. Both mine, and my husband's meals were appallingly bad. As soon as mine arrived, he asked 'Where is the rest of your dinner?"". When his arrived he promptly lifted his Atlantic trout out of the curdled swill that surrounded it and ate it off his bread plate. My two tiny, unaccompanied agnolotti were the texture of cardboard. I managed to eat half of one and tried picking out the tiny smear of mushroom duxelle, but the other was headed for the garbage bin. Nothing else was on the plate for $31., and even the bread cost extra. The next night we ate at the Keg right across the road and got a much better meal for less money. Oh, and the ambiance? 1980's hotel breakfast bar. There is none."

I been putting it off for years as it just doesn’t wow me whenever I look at pictures of it or read about it. Since I live next door I decided to support local. The atmosphere was great, the service was splendid and the food was prepared in a flash.  I got a Sapporo beer to wash it all down.  The food was flavourful and extremely fresh. After trying ramen I can say I’m not a fan of the style of meal it is. It was nothing to do with this place as they seem extremely knowledgeable and serve up a great ramen but as I stated… not my thing. If you like ramen I suggest trying this place. For myself this was a one time experience."
Buta Ramen,Ramen,"5190 Morris St Halifax, NS B3J 1B3 Canada",NS,44.6417609,-63.5709603,5,"A hidden gem right downtown!

Pretty cozy space with not a lot of seating, so keep that in mind if you have a larger group attending.

Their vegetarian ramen is delicious, so flavorful and loaded with toppings. They also offer a tasty korokke (croquette) if you're looking for a veggie appetizer. The tables each have some additional toppings as well if you want to kick it up a notch.

I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of options for Japanese brews and liquors - their sake was smooth and tasty - nothing fancy, but just nice to have the option available on a cold day.

Would recommend checking it out if you have an itch for ramen in the downtown core."

I ordered the Nagasaki Champion, and my partner had the Tantanmen. To start we had the Chicken Karaage. All of it was amazing, so good! The atmosphere was cute and cozy. All of the staff members who served us were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable. The food came out lightening quick and it was busy! Will definitely be back again!"

The tantan noodle was better flavoured but there was only a bite of meat. The fried squid legs were delicious."
Palladium Family Restaurant,Greek,"942 Cole Harbour Road Dartmouth, NS B2V 1E6 Canada",NS,44.6709796,-63.4963541,2,Really disappointed with the food after seeing lots of good reviews. The lemon potatoes must have been soaking for days.  The spinicapita was soaked in grease.  I actually sat it on napkin before taking it home to soak up some of the grease.  Thd waitress was excellent and the drinks were good .
Palladium Family Restaurant,Greek,"942 Cole Harbour Road Dartmouth, NS B2V 1E6 Canada",NS,44.6709796,-63.4963541,5,"Such a great experience! Received a warm welcome from the moment we walked in and had excellent service the entire time.
We ordered the Eggs Benedict, Fried Calamari and Fish & Chips (Three Pieces)
The Eggs and Calamari were great but the star was the Fish & Chips! They were huge! Remarkable fish to batter ratio and very nice texture."
Palladium Family Restaurant,Greek,"942 Cole Harbour Road Dartmouth, NS B2V 1E6 Canada",NS,44.6709796,-63.4963541,2,"Hard pass on the breakfast next time for me.

Walked into the restaurant to be immediately greeted with the door closer hanging off the frame. Was seated fairly promptly and ordered a bacon & feta omelet with a poutine hollandaise home fries with toast and wife ordered a Mediterranean Benny. Daughter ordered a waffle with bacon. While the restaurant was practically empty the food took forever and the server never really came back to see if we wanted our beverages topped off. The other server looked over in what appeared to be concern but didn’t really assist the matter.

We finally get our food and the wife’s Benny looked quite paltry compared to similar restaurants Benny meals. Perhaps it was the small eggs and the micro hash browns but our portions in general were on the verge of being below average.

My meal had to be sent back as the poutine did not appear on my plate. 7 minutes later my food reappeared as everyone else finished their food. I found it extremely odd that it took that long just to put cheese on the home fries. The hollandaise itself was tasty. The omelet was more of a mixed western with bacon and feta but it didn’t quite taste like the feta I’m used to. At his point I didn’t really care too much over the entire experience as I was starving. Sorry forgot to take a photo as I was ravenous by that point.

Daughter received a decent waffle with a side plate of bacon (again kind of odd not to be on the same plate but not the end of the world). We were packing up waiting for the bill when the waitress recalled she had to bring jello for the daughter but decided it was a to go thing instead of giving it to her with her meal. Then forgot the spoon. Kind of unfortunate.

So sadly the entire first time experience pulled my mood down and is reflected in my review. Perhaps I may try the seafood lunch/dinner but right not I’m disappointed enough that I may not just bother. We had tried to get into this place one other time and the waitress tried to shove us into a tight corner where neither my wife or I could even get between the table and the chair so we walked out."
Palladium Family Restaurant,Greek,"942 Cole Harbour Road Dartmouth, NS B2V 1E6 Canada",NS,44.6709796,-63.4963541,5,Best breakfast and coffee in town (served to 4pm which is perfect for some of us like myself who doesn't eat breakfast until early afternoon)..... They consistently serve up some of the best meals in town and the prices are very reasonable.  My wife and I often share the seafood platter when we go out for dinner or lunch (which is fantastic btw....) highly recommend...

Byblos Lebanese Cuisine,Lebanese,"644 Portland Street Dartmouth, NS B2W 6C4 Canada",NS,44.6707786,-63.5261709,5,"Discovered Byblos just over a year ago... and I keep coming back. Their food is the definition of comfort food. Warm, delicious and flavourful. The space is inviting and all staff are beyond friendly. I especially adore Sara, who is an exceptional server and gives great recommendations.

If you enjoy hot spicy like me, give the chicken kadai a shot. Something I appreciate about Byblos is how FRESH the spices are. It truly makes all the difference. My favourite dish so far is the butter chicken - the best I've tried anywhere in the halifax area. The veg samosas and butter chicken are great options if you're looking for something more mild.

Whether you're coming here for a full meal, or a quick snack, I find it quite affordable.

Attached are photos of the aloo tikki chaat, butter chicken with rice and garlic naan - which is a classic. (Of course we also had some gulab jamun for dessert but it was gone so quickly I forgot to take a picture!)

Thank you Byblos! You always make my night. I will never stop recommending this awesome local restaurant."

The menu was Indian with lots of varieties(veg and non veg) and the drink menu had a great variety of wines, spirits and cocktails. There was a bubble tea bar too so that was a good touch. The staff is very accommodating, warm, friendly and welcoming. We ordered Veg Manchuria, Chicken 65, Naans and Jeera Rice - everything was made fresh and the taste of every dish was amazing. The food came out in 15 minutes and we were very happy overall.
I highly recommend this place to everyone."

It was the second time we got the all you can eat Sushi. We had the food in about 6 minutes which was crazy. The place is never to busy which is nice so there isn’t usually a wait, but it is always busy enough for a good atmosphere. They seem to do a huge take out service which I am sure we will be trying some night after work. It is now our go to spot for sushi since we moved to a Lower Sackville, it is worth the visit for anyone outside of the area as well. #sushi"

All you can eat ordering done via paper. The Service was slow and the restaurant was not very busy on the inside but it did look like there was alot of pickup/mobile orders being prepped.
The food itself was ok...too much rice with the sushi and some of our sashimi was still slightly frozen.
Bathrooms were a mess, water everywhere on the sink, dirty doors, wet floors."

This place has a vibe.  Wednesday night and the place was packed with a vibrant crowd.     Staff and service was excellent.

You can tell when the owners out their own personal touches in the food.   Everything was homemade and fresh.  The menu has some creative elements but always some standard loves such as the Pork Ramen.     The drinks were a surprise hit.   Cannot wait to find the next opportunity to go back."

My partner and I had the chicken karaage and I had the bulgogi short rib and he had the chicken sandwich with the parmesan fries. Our server was very friendly. Love that they have an iPad with a visual menu, makes choosing the food easier and more fun. Drinks were good. My friend's had the chicken crisps, the Bao that was on special, the burger and the small ramen bowl and raved about how food their food was. Was pleasantly surprised there were so many gluten free options. Will DEFINITELY be back."

Studio East Food+Drink,Gastropubs,"6021 Cunard Street Halifax, NS B3K 1E5 Canada",NS,44.6508145,-63.5931283,4,"Good Asian fusion options.  Was very cool to see that they provide an iPad at your table to show you pictures of all the dishes - absolutely helps with decision making.  First time I’ve ever seen that.  I’d recommend the bao buns as an appetizer.  The tofu bao had good flavour and was not dry.  We also enjoyed the chicken crisp and the studio dumplings for apps.  My partner had the chicken rice bowl - this was a miss for us.  It was very saucy almost too the point of soupy and we found the different sauces they used did not really compliment each other.
I had the kung pao cauliflower bowl which was great - I opted for the noodles.  The only suggestion is I wish it had more vegetables because it’s quite carb heavy with the noodles and the cauliflower being fried.
Overall - I would visit again, they seem to change the menu quite often which is great."
Shuck Seafood and Raw Bar,Seafood,"5120 Salter Street Halifax, NS B3J 0A1 Canada",NS,44.645094,-63.5708364,5,"Loved it here. Super friendly and considerate waitress. Ordered a Seafood Petite Tower that came with two different sets of oysters, half a lobster, tuna sashimi, halibut, and chopped scallops. Absolutely delicious. We also ordered a separate two sets of oysters which tasted quite different. Was nice trying them all. The seafood chowder was amazing as well. Highly recommend and would come here again."

Ordered a couple other dishes to try and we discovered that the fish & chips here are to die for! One big piece of fresh fish in thin panko crust - yummy. We didn’t have enough and ordered more. I’m not a big fan of thick greasy batter so I really enjoyed their version. The octopus salad, on the other hand, was a little fishy for me."

What an amazing experience right from when we stepped into the restaurant! The staff is very helpful, polite and friendly. It was Happy Hour so we had to indulge in the oysters. Every oyster was FRESH and nicely shucked. The BEST OYSTERS we have ever had (and I have had PLENTY!)! Next we had the the suggested meal for my husband baked cod, and fish and chips for me. Once again, we thoroughly enjoyed our food! We will be back again and again as long as they put out such amazing food. We were too full to even consider dessert. One recommendation would be to use some sort of noise dampening material in the restaurant as it is very LOUD making conversation difficult. Other than the latter, it was a totally awesome experience! Thank you, Shuck's!"

Pricing is reasonable, not cheap but on the lower end in comparison to nearby restaurants for the same foods. The facility also has a lot of eco-friendly features, one of my favourite being that the bathroom provides fresh towels for drying your hands with a basket under the sink for the used towels rather than wasteful paper towel."

The chicken wings were amazing, my husband raved about the flavour of the HOT WINGS, they did run out of Honey Garlic though so I was not able to try the wings myself. We ordered dessert along with a cocktail and beer. I had the Ocean Pearl, it was very delicious.

My husband and I will definitely be back to have the Nachos again!

Restaurant was nice inside with a good atmosphere, the option of Bar side or Restaurant. Service was also really great, friendly and Quick."

Unfortunately, I did not enjoy the buttermilk sliders as much as I thought I would. They were very dense, a but dry, and could have used some acidity to round out the flavour of the dish. Also, my cocktail really needed to come with a straw to mix it better. The gin royale was sitting on top of the lemonade."

Found a cozy spot inside next to the water in their indoor bar seating. Had few drinks(That ocean cocktail was excellent). The Fish and Chips were nice with very less oil. I tried their Candied Bacon Burger which was a pleasant surprise. We also had the Maple Curry Chicken Penne Pasta which was decent. All in all, a good experience. Will probably come here on a cooler day again to try eating at their patio as the view seemed even better."

From the start, I knew I chose well. Excellent and attentive service from Morgan went a long way to making our afternoon stop enjoyable.

And then there’s the menu. So many things sound so good - took me a while to decide. But choosing the pulled pork wontons for an appetizer was the right move. Y-U-M. Everything we had was terrific. We’ll worth the ferry ride from Halifax. If I lived nearby, I could easily see myself eating my way through the entire menu!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 🌟"

Layout is ok, decoration require reinstate the tables and seats need to be redone, some chairs are not comfortable. Colors are dark, if you offer breakfast then, you should make the atmosphere brighter. Also the there is a fridge in the middle of the dining area need to be relocated.
Service, is within expectations, the with waitress well known of the  menu and able to explain the ingredients.
Waiting time for the order, my experience is within expectations, as a matter of fact I received my order today very fast.
Cleanliness, I noticed the place cleanliness is within expectations.
Test, the food taste was delicious and Rich. I really felt full. I have only one issue with the breakfast menu, I don't eat bacon and most of the options has bacon.
Prices, really the price was extremely acceptable ($).
Conclusion: I liked my experience, and I see if you tried it, you should have a good experience."

There's a comfort in the simple 'Mom & Pop' feel to this place, which is nothing fancy, but gives a content feeling.  Four booths by the window, four or five other tables, with total seating capacity for probably 35-40 total.  Friendly service from staff and owners.  Reasonable prices.  I enjoyed the breakfast wrap on my most recent visit (lettuce, tomato, bacon, egg and I think cheddar) with side of home fries, and hollandaise as a bonus.  Good size, well prepared, satisfying.  The dishes I'd tried before,  are too long ago to remember the details, but I do recall that they were safe, filling, no complaints.  There are Greek options available that I am looking forward to trying in the future.  Kid friendly.  Accessible with lots of free parking in the plaza."

The Old Triangle Irish Alehouse,Pubs,"5136 Prince Street Halifax, NS B3J 1L4 Canada",NS,44.6474885,-63.5724053,4,"Great bar that reminds me of a local pub back in Montreal! It's a little loud but then again it's a pub with music and people are having fun.

The food is decent although my burger was a little dry and the Dublin pasties as well was dry. Drinks had been good so nothing to complain about that. The live singer was nice to hear !

The portions are just enough for me and my partner enjoyed her meal as well! Prices are dencent !"

We ordered a fish appetizer, a seafood pasta and a fish and chips, everything was delicious.
The prices are pretty good for the area and they have different beers and local ciders to try."

The vegetarian burger was unfortunately not as good as my friend had hoped. Although I can definitely recommend their Footballs Club Sandwich. Dipping it in the hot sauce definitely made it not-so-crispy(to be expected) but the taste was fantastic. The cocktail was great, albeit very slightly on the expensive side.
Can recommend if you’re looking for a nice-relaxing time with good food."

Busan Korean BBQ,Korean,"6311 Quinpool Road Halifax, NS B3L 1A4 Canada",NS,44.6451534,-63.599015,5,Highly recommended! Best soup I've had in a while.

We didn’t get BBQ this time but went with some lunch specials and a few add-ons to try.    Service was quick, pleasant and efficient.  The price was very reasonable.   The food was the show stopper.   The Spicy Pork Bone Ramen had great flavour with bouncy firm noodles.   Just the right amount of spice.  The Tteokbokki was sweet and spicy.   The sauce was a used for dipping Gyoza and Kimchi Pancake.   The pancake is a must try if you go.   Absolutely delicious.    Todays lunch made 3 new regular customers."

Price wise, the combos were reasonable, maybe a little more than I would expect but the individual dishes were on the cheaper side. The service was quick and kind and the grills on the tables managed the smoke well so it felt very comfortable. The side dishes served with the combos felt on the smaller side, and I wish there had been more option for vegetables to grill. Overall would recommend, but expect a to leave stuffed!"

Here we had the bulgogi beef lunch and fried chicken. The beef doesn't skimp on flavour and is loaded with vegetables, served on rice. The boneless fried chicken bites were tossed in a sweet chili sauce and served with tteokbokki. They come with a variety of side dishes like kimchi and potato which you can refill for free.

Staff were very professional and friendly. Very affordable too--we had lunch for two + a pear juice drink for under $25. Pay for cash for a discount!"

Lot of options to choose from including a gluten free options. The food is packed with flavors and served with many side dishes. Reasonably priced food in great quantity.
Harbour City Bar & Grill,Bars,"1990 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1P2 Canada",NS,44.6507037,-63.5778172,4,We went in after making a reservation on St. Patrick’s Day. Given it was a busier-than-usual day the service was a bit slow(understandable). The portion sizes were fine with the taste being above average. The fried chicken burger was fine although I wish it had one piece of fried chicken instead of few tiny ones as it would be easier to handle. The pasta and the black bean burger were a success and can be recommended for Vegetarian folks. Weirdly their fries were soft and not crunchy. The taste was fine though so not an issue. Highly recommend their Black Forest cake. The taste of Beep Brulee wasn’t something one of our friends expected but the staff was generous enough to replace her order for no extra charge. This was almost at their closing time(Appreciate this for sure). Their service is good and I’ll be sure to visit again someday to try rest of their menu.

Harbour City Bar & Grill,Bars,"1990 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1P2 Canada",NS,44.6507037,-63.5778172,2,"When we booked our vacation here, we were very excited to see that they had some dairy-free options, as my wife has a dairy allergy. Unfortunately, between the booking and our trip, it looks like the vast majority of them were removed from the menu. Usually we can get by asking them not to use cheese or butter, but apparently both their hamburger buns and their multigrain toast contain milk for some reason. We also informed the server of her allergy ahead of time and were still served butter on toast - had my wife not double checked before eating, she would have been seriously ill. Will eat elsewhere for the rest of our trip as they clearly do not take allergens seriously here."
Harbour City Bar & Grill,Bars,"1990 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1P2 Canada",NS,44.6507037,-63.5778172,5,"This isn't your ordinary hotel restaurant!

Would definitely come here to enjoy some seafood while staying in Halifax without the ""tourist tax"" like at the waterfront."

Moxies,Canadian (New),"9 Countryview Dr Dartmouth, NS B3B 0G4 Canada",NS,44.7008476,-63.5656071,4,"We chose Moxie's because of the location in Dartmouth Crossing close to where we were shopping, past experience, great parking. The restaurant has a classy, dark vibe with modern features. The booth was comfortable for plus size people and we had lots of privacy. The restaurant was loud though not full, just lots of dishes clanging and dishes dropped on one occasion. Our server was brand new. She did a great job; polite, friendly, knew the menu well, checked in with us frequently but not too much, and helped me look for missing keys. The water was good for Halifax; I'm not sure if it's filtered. Our meals were quite good but definitely higher in price for quantity. The food presentation was very nice, taste was delicious and the meals sat just right with us (no stuffed bellies). I ordered the cashew chicken lettuce wraps from the appetizer menu and they were a meal on there own. My daughter ordered the mango chicken from the main dinner menu and found it small for the price. The summer menu offers lots of flavors, and we were glad we ordered the cashew dip as an appetizer or we would have still felt hungry. Overall, a very positive experience and I will go again."
Moxies,Canadian (New),"9 Countryview Dr Dartmouth, NS B3B 0G4 Canada",NS,44.7008476,-63.5656071,5,"Movies never disappoints. Our waitress, Himaly, could not have been better. When 2 items were not available she made several suggestions on other items or how substitutions could be made with the items that were sold out. Her drink recommendation was bang on. Our table was comfortable. Atmosphere was good. I will definitely dine at Moxies again."

Had tabbouleh, grape leaves, souvlaki, and Station 1 platter. Baclava too. Greatly enjoyed the meal and overall experience!"
Station1 Lebanese Kitchen,Syrian,"50 Tacoma Drive Dartmouth, NS B2W 3E6 Canada",NS,44.6796256,-63.5396031,1,"I don't give bad reviews often but I'm not thrilled about my first time getting take out here.

When I arrived, the restaurant was pretty empty except for one customer.

I ordered a chicken souvlaki plate which on the website says that it's supposed to be $11.99+tax for 1 skewer. They charged me $14.49+tax. The chicken skewers were barely edible since they had been mostly charred (see photo) and were extremely dry. The fatoush salad was lackluster and the pickled turnips were also dry af. My friend remarked that the pita bread looked like it had been picked up from the streets of Aqraba. Hummus was also pretty bland in flavour - it needed more garlic for sure.

Staff member serving me seemed quite unhappy to be working that day as well. Not sure if that is a one-off.

Either way, despite the high ratings this place has on Google Maps, I'm disappointed to say I would not recommend this establishment."
Station1 Lebanese Kitchen,Syrian,"50 Tacoma Drive Dartmouth, NS B2W 3E6 Canada",NS,44.6796256,-63.5396031,5,"This is my new favourite shawarma place! The Station 1 shawarma (Syrian shawarma) is absolutely delicious and the plates here are big. I never leave hungry, that’s for sure. Staff is super friendly and kind enough to teach me how to say Muhammara, (which is delicious, btw). My favourite plate is the falafel plate with lentil rice, Fattoush salad and muhammara. Their falafel is so good it’s really hard to go anywhere else that I still think have good falafel and I don’t mind driving a little further down the road to enjoy the excellent food at Station 1."
Station1 Lebanese Kitchen,Syrian,"50 Tacoma Drive Dartmouth, NS B2W 3E6 Canada",NS,44.6796256,-63.5396031,5,"Watched the staff make fresh falafel, something you don't find everywhere. Really fresh and delicious!"
Station1 Lebanese Kitchen,Syrian,"50 Tacoma Drive Dartmouth, NS B2W 3E6 Canada",NS,44.6796256,-63.5396031,5,"I don't know how anyone can give the food and service at Station #1 less then 5 stars. I really enjoy Lebanese cuisine and have made a point to try as many places in HRM as I could back when I was on the road everyday for work. That being said I have had recommendations from my middle Eastern colleagues on other places in HRM to try which I have and they were good as well, but can't hold a flame to Station #1. We live in Lower Sackville and when ever we get the urge for good shawarma we always end up at Station #1 and have never been disappointed. In fact we used to go there before they moved to Tacoma and started to get known. Their previous location did not get as much traffic because they were tucked at the end of a small strip mall on the corner of Forest Hills Parkway and Main Street. Now with their improved location people are starting to notice and try them, so they can get busy at times, but it is worth the wait if you arrive and there is a line up!

The portions are always more than fair for the price you pay (comparing to other competitors), the service has always been great. Their hummus is made from scratch, and not that pre-packaged grocery grade wanna be hummus. The owners care about their customers and you will often find them behind the counter working to ensure a good consistent quality of food is produced. They make their food with love and it shows in the flavour!

If you have not tried Station #1 yet, you need to take a trip to Tacoma Plaza in Dartmouth and so yourself a favour. You will thank me later! I have said this before to everyone I know who enjoys Lebanese food, and I will continue to say it, that this is the best you will find in Halifax. Hands down! Keep up the great work guys. As always, I will be back! 👍👍

(I confess as many times as I have eaten there I have not even thought about taking pictures. All I think about is eating and enjoying their food, but I will update the next time we go!)

//Update// So I have been back a few more times since and still forgot to get pictures but this time my daughter reminded me 🙂

Still 5 stars as expected! I would give them a higher rating if I could! We also have their grape leaves and cheese rolls a try in addition to our usual chicken shawarma and they were both amazing as expected! 👍👍"
The Barrington Steakhouse and Oyster Bar,Steakhouses,"1662 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 2A2 Canada",NS,44.6466528,-63.5739216,1,"It took me a while to get around to this, but the experience was so memorable that I couldn't let it pass. We visited Halifax about a month ago - May 2023. In spite of our terrible dining experience, I've heard others defend the place. Even one of our 3-person dinner party that evening, a local resident, was surprised and said it's usually quite good. I guess we got them on the wrong night then, the weeknight B-Crew. The service & food were equally abysmal. The hostess was unfriendly, the waiter was a wise guy who thought he was funny (I wish he had been), and possibly 1-2 of the dishes we had between the 3 of us rose to the level of average (not the steaks). That's just not acceptable at their price point. We were 3 and spent about $500-600, I don't quite recall exactly. Only the wine was good.

Now I could drone on about the details far more than you'd care to read, but a picture is worth 1000 words. I will take a moment, though, to advise you against ordering the wedge salad. Unless you think a wedge salad is bibb lettuce, a boiled egg, and some kind of dressing I couldn't identify. If you do, then definitely order the wedge salad. The wise guy waiter was certain it was correct. It was at that moment I realized things were not going to get better and I should enjoy the wine. How this steakhouse classic could go so off the rails at a posh place like Barrington's, I can only guess. In hindsight, I should have taken a picture. But wait, I did promise you a picture. Check out whatever it was that arrived when we ordered another steakhouse classic, Creme Brulee. The over blackened top was hiding a blue surprise. I have no idea what it was, but it was disgusting. I think what bothered me the most was that they didn't think there was anything wrong. They were completely unaware of their incompetence. The last time I had an experience even close to this bad was in the height of covid, when you were lucky to even find a place open."
The Barrington Steakhouse and Oyster Bar,Steakhouses,"1662 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 2A2 Canada",NS,44.6466528,-63.5739216,4,"The restaurant is beautifully decorated and had a great upscale vibe that sets the tone for a great dining experience. The Oysters were fresh and served with a variety of sauces that perfectly complemented the Oysters. Also the dessert is a YES!

I found the service was lacking a bit, we were waiting for some time to get a server stopping by to set up the table with utensils and to take the order....

Overall, the quality of the food and the beautiful atmosphere makes this restaurant a must try 😋"

I was a bit skeptical as to being rushed due to the hours of operation but i needed not to worry. Every item ordered was superb! Compliments to the chef; i perhaps missed my server's name but she was great. My only reason for taking a star was due to the noise level because of how small the space is within the restaurant.

Started off with the mussels and had the featured fish of the day - seared halibut and scallop on a shrimp risotto. The fish was perfectly cooked, the skin was crispy but the meat was still nice and juicy. Finished off with the chocolate espresso torte. Everything was delicious but the fish definitely was my favourite. One of the best resturants I've tried in Halifax. Would definitely come again!"

We chose this place since it had good reviews but quite frankly it was not well deserved based off the experience we had.
Service was lacking. The lady at the cash didn't event greet us. Food was also served in a take out container even if you're dining in. Water is also self serve.
They didn't have the item I wanted so we only ended up ordering the bulgogi rice bowl. The dumplings were good, rice was a bit hard but since the dish was so oily, it soften it up. The onion to beef ratio was about 80:20. It also didn't really taste like a regular bulgogi dish and I've been to many Korean restaurants. Def was a bit disappointed."

It was a very good burger topped with brisket and hickory sticks that rounded this off really well.  Another great meal.

How can I say this? The food was so good and attractive that we were halfway before I thought of taking a picture. We love Mic Mac bar and grill but this restaurant gives that one good run for its money. It was amazing that people, on a Friday night, were not lined up here. Not only was the food great, the service was also great, very friendly and helpful. I think this restaurant deserves much more attention. Certainly coming back."

I am happy to admit that I was wrong.  I ordered the soup & sandwich, Rubin sandwich with some type of beef soup.  Both were absolutely delicious.  One of the best Rubin's I have ever had.  The soup was a hot & sour flavour and had big hunks of beef.  I really enjoyed both.  The service was fast and the price reasonable.  I highly recommend this place for lunch."

We stopped in after hearing a friend talk about it. We stopped in for lunch a bit after they opened so there was no wait. There was a sign outside that warns you of a wait during busy times. Not sure why people complain about that, not too sure what they expect if a restaurant is busy.
The food was good, I had the Mediterranean salad with shrimp and found it to be a nice size and enjoyed it. Two others tried their different macaroni, they said it was okay but nothing special. My husband had the chowder and poutine which he was happy with. I tried a bite of the chowder and it was really good, almost wished I had a bowl myself. Waitress was nice and attentive.

They had great decor and our server did his best but we were disappointed in the food. Before we sat down we were warned of a 45 minute wait for food (appreciated the heads up) We wanted mussels but they were out so we ordered bacon wrapped scallops - they were $18 and seriously overcooked and super disappointing. My husband ordered the lobster roll which was soo tiny and I got the lobster mac and cheese. Not sure what kind of meat they had in there but it was not lobster.. it was our first dinner in the city and I wish we had chosen elsewhere.

I went for the shawarma, but I arrived late and the only available item on their menu was fried chicken. They told us upon arrival that it'll take 45 minutes and we decided to wait. It took longer than that, but they apologized and it was only the second day so understandable. The chicken came with garlic sauce and fries. It was fresh and hot, but not juicy. I never like fried chicken so my review could be biased. I didn't enjoy the atmosphere so I'll probably be doing take-out in the future. I like the downtown 902's atmosphere better."
Aladdin,Mediterranean,"746 Bedford Highway Halifax, NS B3M 2L9 Canada",NS,44.7067907,-63.6649239,1,"I visited 902 restaurant earlier today and unfortunately had an extremely disappointing experience. My party and I ordered meals worth around $250 and we were left with a bad taste in our mouths, both figuratively and literally.

First of all, the ambiance was terrible. It was unpleasant to look at. We didn't feel comfortable or relaxed in the environment, which is a key part of any dining experience. There was no heating in peak winters and we were provided with a small portable heater which didn’t help.

The quality of the food was equally terrible. It was apparent that some of the dishes were frozen and then reheated, leading to a loss of flavor and texture. The meat, especially the beef, was extremely dry and shrunk. The outside was burnt, while the inside was hard and rubbery. The Mandi rice dish was also a major disappointment, not tasting or looking like real Mandi rice.

There were a few positives, however. The garlic and spicy sauce were decent, but not enough to save the meal. The broasted chicken looked healthy and crispy, but it was unfortunately the only dish that met any standards. The French fries, chicken and fish all seemed to have been cooked in the same oil, resulting in a strong fishy smell. This was not good for members of our group who don't like the smell of fish, as it interfered with the enjoyment of their meal.

Overall, I regret visiting this restaurant and would not go there again. I will be attaching photos of the dishes we received, and I will leave it up to the readers to judge the quality for themselves."
Aladdin,Mediterranean,"746 Bedford Highway Halifax, NS B3M 2L9 Canada",NS,44.7067907,-63.6649239,5,"We had organized our ladies event at 902 Restaurant in Bedford location recently and I have to say I was impressed with all the arrangements and service provided. The food was deliciously amazing and everything was so smooth in organizing such a big event of around 50 ladies with no hiccups at all. It was only possible because of the Restaurant Manager Naela Al Kurdi and Jason. They are true professionals and know how to satisfy the customer needs. We would like to organize more events in the future because of these two amazing people. Everyone had a wonderful time. Thank you Naela and Jason, truly appreciate your superb management. 👏👏👏"
Aladdin,Mediterranean,"746 Bedford Highway Halifax, NS B3M 2L9 Canada",NS,44.7067907,-63.6649239,4,"Food was delicious but I felt the rice needs to be cooked more. More than enough portions of food in my order which was Roasted Lamb Shank and nice presentation. Service was really good.
It is in the Bedford Highway, there are different Mediterranean restaurants around and this one is a worth try."
Aladdin,Mediterranean,"746 Bedford Highway Halifax, NS B3M 2L9 Canada",NS,44.7067907,-63.6649239,4,"Overall great food!

We ordered a tandoori wrap as well as lentil soup and another main. Everything was well cooked and portions were pretty generous. The tandoori wrap was really the star though the meat was absolutely perfectly cooked, well spiced with a bit of crispiness from the grilling. Our second main was delicious as well, the hummus was the perfect texture and the salad was flavorful.

Service was good.

The decor is nice and the seating is pretty unique with regular tables as well as lounge style areas.

Parking was kind of annoying as there isn't much.

The only main downside is there was a bit of a strong smell of smoke. At least in the lounge area where we were sitting."

We misread the menu thinking we could order regular lunch on the weekend and my daughter was nervous to try something new. She tasted my food and loved it, the waitress was super quick to add to our order and bring out some food her! Really over the top experience. The santa fe benedic was so delicious! The crepes looked amazing!!"

Arrived around 9:15am and expected a wait with school being out and most people being off/on vacation but were seated right away. Definitely just beat the rush! I had the chocolate macchiato to drink and my husband a white cranberry juice. Both were good, I really enjoyed the macchiato 🍫. Husband had the Don Chorizo Eggs Benedict. Chorizo was really good and so were the potatoes (piping hot, flavored well and crispy to the bite), he also opted for the spicy hollandaise sauce. I had the French Toast Crisp, it was really good. Reading the menu I'm always worried about the mint, but it's really only a sprig that is easily removed. Topped with a healthy dollop of whipped cream and lots of fresh raspberries and blueberries. Hope to be back again soon with our toddler!"

My eggs benedict were over cooked and the portions are relatively small. The kids meals are expensive for what you get and the quality is meh, the pancakes were soggy, undercooked and just full of food colouring. I’d like to see fresh fruit or whipped cream added to this dish for kids and maybe a smaller portion."

My partner and I always request Ashley as she is simply the best server! The conversation we have with her and the service she provides is what makes us come back! We live in the city and drive over to the Dartmouth location just to see her as without her our experience is simply not the same."
The Press Gang Restaurant & Oyster Bar,Bars,"5218 Prince Street Halifax, NS B3J 0B1 Canada",NS,44.6470186,-63.5744128,4,"My wife and I decided to pop in here for dinner a bit late (10:30) on a Friday. Our first server, was amazing. She had to leave for some type of appointment quite late, which was disappointing.

We started with calamari and 'beef, bacon and blue'. Both appetizers were cooked and seasoned to perfection.

For mains, we had the seafood risotto and the halibut. Both meals were cooked beautifully, but unfortunately lacked almost any seasoning. Our guess is that a more junior cook had taken over the cooking and was tentative about using salt and pepper. We asked and they brought us two grinders, which helped tremendously.

We would have liked to enjoy a dessert and some he finish of our meal, but our new server came with the bill....without an offer of even a coffee. When we asked about dessert she said 'I can see if I can find a cook to come back and do something for you'.

We passed on the offer. Disappointing way to end a wonderful time. So, the tale of two servers, one great and one that didn't really care.

We are still giving the place a 4-star review, but it's because of our first server and the quality of the food (even with the lack of any seasoning on the mains)."
The Press Gang Restaurant & Oyster Bar,Bars,"5218 Prince Street Halifax, NS B3J 0B1 Canada",NS,44.6470186,-63.5744128,5,"The Press Gang has been one of our favourite restaurants for almost 2 decades.  It’s always a go to choice for a special occasion and/or to stop by for a cocktail & some oysters.
We were recently there for my birthday and they did not disappoint.  Service & food were amazing!

We always tend to choose the drill rather than ordering selections from the menu. This is where the chef designs a 4-course dining experience for two.  No two drill’s are ever the same.  It’s a great choice if you want to be surprised and try something new.  We recommend doing the wine parings as well.
Each course is delivered with an excellent explanation from the server or executive chef detailing what you will experience.

This dining experience was our best one yet!  Below are pictures of our dining experience from February 24."
The Press Gang Restaurant & Oyster Bar,Bars,"5218 Prince Street Halifax, NS B3J 0B1 Canada",NS,44.6470186,-63.5744128,5,"Ordered The Drill. It was great. I love not knowing what I'm in for. I also love four course meals. Everything was amazing. If I am being hyper chef critical, each plate seemed like it was trying very hard to be amazing. It came off as a bit busy. Maybe more than a bit. When you have all the amazing ingredients you can use them all, but do you need to? There were no less than seven amazing flavors in the desert.  The beef tenderloin w/demi-glace was truly great. 4.87 ⭐️"

Our server was very knowledgeable, explaining where the oysters were from and then explaining every item on our charcuterie board.
The service was fantastic and I would definitely go back when in Halifax!"
The Press Gang Restaurant & Oyster Bar,Bars,"5218 Prince Street Halifax, NS B3J 0B1 Canada",NS,44.6470186,-63.5744128,5,"Absolutely loved everything about this place. The location was in mid downtown core, so it was easy to find. They had live music, which was a great touch to my dinner. The fresh oysters was to die, for I would fly all the way back from Toronto just to try these oysters again.

Would definitely recommend and would definitely go back."

Their food was amazing and delicious. We ordered Braised Pork Shoulder. It was so good and melted in my mouth. Braised Beef Brisket was also tender. Both dishes were not easily and need longer time to cook. Anyhow, it is worth for waiting. We definitely will be back soon for exploring more menu."
A Taste of the East,Chinese,"1589 Dresden Row Halifax, NS B3J 2K4 Canada",NS,44.6446081,-63.5786431,4,"The food was authentic and flavourful but a bit oily for my liking. Despite that, we visited twice during our trip to Halifax and enjoyed the dishes that we tried. There were far more meat focused dishes than mixed or vegetarian options but it wasn’t too difficult to customize or make requests. Service was very friendly as well."

A Taste of the East,Chinese,"1589 Dresden Row Halifax, NS B3J 2K4 Canada",NS,44.6446081,-63.5786431,5,"Authentic North Eastern Chinese food. A big menu with various dish options and even daily lunch specials available. We have been here many times and they are very consistent with the taste of their dish. We got the zesty eggplant which is cooked in a lot of oil, but is so worth it with plain white rice. We also ordered the squid tentacle stir fry, which also comes in fried fish version, and the coating they have on the squid tentacles is very unique and is so addicting to eat along with the vegetables. Highly recommended if you want to try some North Eastern Chinese food that is made by Chinese chefs who are familiar with the cuisine."

Had little bit of everything there. The wings we're so delicious. The Buffalo chicken sandwich was good as well the poutine was average but also good. Had there garlic fingers the garlic fingers were good. But the wings are to die for one of the best place for wings I when too. Great size great sauce 👌.

Tonight, we had a wonderfully friendly waitress who was bubbly and excellent. A friend and I had the pulled pork boa. It was amazing! Soft and juicy! Highly recommend trying them next time you are at Trendz!"

Started with the mussels which were lightly seasoned and sitting in a beer-based broth with nice pieces of focaccia. Fish tacos were quite nice. The buffalo chicken sandwich had a lot going on. There was bacon, lettuce, and cherry tomato on it as well. The vinegar was a little strong in places but was good overall."
Trendz Café and Wine Bar,Wine Bars,"15 Spectacle Lake Drive Dartmouth, NS B3B 1X7 Canada",NS,44.7001792,-63.5823395,2,"I’m reviewing this based on a takeaway order. We travel with a dog so don’t have the opportunity to dine in anyplace.  If you are looking at takeaway back to your hotel I’d suggest finding another restaurant. We had two orders of the mac n cheese and a Caesar salad. Each mac n cheese was maybe a cup and a half of elbow macaroni in a rather ordinary cheese sauce. The ‘caesar’ salad was a bunch of kale with a side of dressing and some kind of fried Parmesan chip on top. No croutons, no shredded Parmesan. How they can call it a Caesar salad is beyond me. This three dishes totalled almost $50, even with a 15% discount, and were completely not worth it. We were very disappointed with what we got for that kind of money. Very little value or enjoyment at all. Now, if you dine in that might be a completely different story, I cannot vouch for that, but for takeaway look elsewhere."

Conveniently located next door to where we were staying.  While it was extremely busy they found us a nice ground level table by the door - good temps on a warm July evening and atmosphere.

The pizza was delicious, I would definitely order it again and do want to go dine in as the food looks amazing. The only thing that I did not like was that I got charged $3 more for a topping (onions), and there was none on my pizza, and I love onions on pizza. The girl working was super friendly, and we had a great laugh as there was a big group of girls staying at the hotel, and she thought that she gave away their pizza to another group 🤣 but when she looked there was another one ready.

Mizu All You Can Eat,Japanese,"644 Portland Street Dartmouth, NS B2W 6C4 Canada",NS,44.6707786,-63.5261709,4,"We had never heard of this all you can eat restaraunt before.
We happened to be in the area and googled Japanese cuisine. We were not disappointed. Moderate amount of parking spaces for a strip mall corner side store front; with plenty of seating inside. (
Can easily accomidate large groups, or appropriate for small intimate meals.)
The host sat us at a window booth around 230. Lunch price and menu ended 215. So, for over 30$ a person supper menu was offered. A bite pricy for all you can eat but justifiable price *IF* you dont tip, want quick service and considering covid recoup for business/tourist slump.... but because of price it wouldn't be a regular spot for us.
How to order: From our table a tablet was handed to us to select the images to send our own order digitally to the kitchen. Items were separated into categories, and when clicked upon the photo you can see a brief description of some of the items, click quantities then send the order to the kitchen. (As many times as you like). The establishment was medium well maintained no obveous structual wear a tear, with wood chop sticks and serving dishes in good shape. Bathrooms were suitable but could use some touch up. Old finger prints on the tablet. Standard canadian accomidated sushi and Thai food. Quick and friendly service with servers brining one or a few items to all tables throughout your meal.

The have the rule ""any wasted food may incur a extra charge"" and I am ashamed to say I was defeated by this restaurant and could not finish one order of sushi, however they allowed us to take our left overs home as we didn't order massive amount of food.

Great restaurant and will be back"

I love ordering food on a tablet so there is less order mistakes and less person to person interaction for introverts like me. The tablet also includes icons to show what is vegetarian or spicy as well.

Went both times with my vegetarian girlfriend and found the menu has many wonderful vegetarian options that everyone can enjoy. No problems at anytime and I find the price for all you can eat is very fair for what you can get. Dessert is included in the price, drinks are extra.

Highly recommend and will be going to eat here at least once a month."

The service is great, they send the food out fairly quick and constant, depending on how much you order per round.

The dessert is limited but good and quite tasty. Ice cream, deep fried banana and a mango pudding and one or two more goodies.

Pricy, but the quality is awesome ! For two people, it's around $80."

The Orient Chinese Cuisine,Chinese,"227 Bedford HIghway Halifax, NS B3M 2J9 Canada",NS,44.6763391,-63.6479348,1,"Honestly, the workers were super duper friendly, but that’s about it. The food was horrible to say the least. I had very high expectations considering the high prices and the multiple certificates and trophy pics the chef had displayed. It’s easily the worst Chinese food I’ve ever tasted. The Shanghai noodles were bland, I couldn’t believe it. Felt like I was chewing nothing. I’m not exaggerating. The fried rice was somehow even worse. For $26 you would think it would taste somewhat decent, but tbh at that point I’d rather munch on a plain bowl of plain white rice. My last straw was the shrimp. Honestly how does one mess up Shrimp? It Literally has to be the simplest thing to cook but barely had any flavour. I will not be trying this place again, tbh you’re better off grabbing cheap Chinese mall food. Good customer service though."
The Orient Chinese Cuisine,Chinese,"227 Bedford HIghway Halifax, NS B3M 2J9 Canada",NS,44.6763391,-63.6479348,5,"Authentic food! Service was good and welcoming. The chief chatted with us for a while. I loved the food is not as sweet as other places in NS. Price is higher than other Chinese restaurants for sure but we can tell the difference.
Not a spacious restaurant. Would be nice if there are more space and tables."
The Orient Chinese Cuisine,Chinese,"227 Bedford HIghway Halifax, NS B3M 2J9 Canada",NS,44.6763391,-63.6479348,5,"FRESH FRESH FRESH!  I could not believe how fresh the food is at this restaurant!  It was my daughter's first time trying Chinese and when the waitress learned this, she brought out eggrolls on the house for her to try (the most amazing egg rolls I have EVER had!), so sweet and welcoming of her! I highly recommend this place if you are looking for authentic, fresh chinese food!"
The Orient Chinese Cuisine,Chinese,"227 Bedford HIghway Halifax, NS B3M 2J9 Canada",NS,44.6763391,-63.6479348,5,"Best place to have Peking duck within NS! My boyfriend isn’t a soup person but he loves the duck soup. Bamboo boots in the duck stir fry make the flavour so fresh! Love love it! Customer service is also amazing. There was another family with two little kids, waitress was very patient to the kids :)"
The Orient Chinese Cuisine,Chinese,"227 Bedford HIghway Halifax, NS B3M 2J9 Canada",NS,44.6763391,-63.6479348,5,"Just tried for the first time. I’m not a foodie but I found that the Orients food was very fresh and felt good on my belly. Hard to explain but compared to other Chinese food it just felt premium. The owner Ivan came by to check in on us, very nice guy.

Highly recommend if you want to try more traditional Chinese food with what would seem like quality ingredients!"
Mirchi Tandoor,Indian,"5232 Blowers Street Halifax, NS B3J 1J7 Canada",NS,44.6449791,-63.5739047,5,Really impressed with the quality and quantity of food. All the dishes we ordered had authentic Indian taste. Quantity was also good. But there were only 2 ladies taking orders and serving. It was clearly overwhelming for them. Otherwise everything was excellent.
Mirchi Tandoor,Indian,"5232 Blowers Street Halifax, NS B3J 1J7 Canada",NS,44.6449791,-63.5739047,4,"I was worried as we were 1st to arrive and well the bathroom is gross, since all the urine stains must have been from earlier in the day or from the day before. I am a little concerned it that is going to reflect on the food. Restaurant itself looks clean and service was fast and very nice. The food…. Looked, smelled and tasted amazing. I just did butter chicken but it was so creamy and good. I will be back"
Mirchi Tandoor,Indian,"5232 Blowers Street Halifax, NS B3J 1J7 Canada",NS,44.6449791,-63.5739047,4,"We were in downtown Halifax and looking for a place to eat when we decided to check this place out as you could smell the aroma of tasty Indian food as you got near the restaurant .

It is a fairly small restaurant and seemed very popular as it was packed but after a wait we were able to get a table, The menu was fairly large so it was hard for me to choose what to have (a good problem), I eventually opted for the Lamb Shank Biryani with Chilly Garlic Naan. I thought the food tasted excellent and it was extremely filling. I could barely finish the meal despite finding it to be delicious. The price was very reasonable for what you got.

The staff were very helpful in helping us out as one of us had a food allergy so they took particular care in helping him find a dish that he could eat safely.

Being in downtown Halifax it has the usual issues of trying to get parking close to it, but that is not a reflection of the restaurant more of the whole area. They also have delivery options as I noticed a number being picked up while we were there."
Mirchi Tandoor,Indian,"5232 Blowers Street Halifax, NS B3J 1J7 Canada",NS,44.6449791,-63.5739047,5,"Super delicious food, we had lamb biriyani, Tandoori chicken, naan bread, and a dessert I forgot the name. Big portion, fair price. I have to mention the owner and stuff are super friendly, definitely will go back !Highly recommended!!!"
Mirchi Tandoor,Indian,"5232 Blowers Street Halifax, NS B3J 1J7 Canada",NS,44.6449791,-63.5739047,4,"Excellent food and located at an excellent place at the heart of Halifax. You might not find much parking space around. However the food is delicious and the portions are massive, we had a takeaway order. The chicken Biryani is bone in loaded with 3 leg pieces. Two plates of chicken Biryani is enough for 3 people. The chicken lababdar was mind blowing. I would recommend this to everyone."
Field Guide,Canadian (New),"2076 Gottingen Street Halifax, NS B3K 3B4 Canada",NS,44.6514864,-63.5828036,4,"Pretty decent spot with interesting food options. Seating is rather limited - even with a reservation we were seated at the bar, which was kind of uncomfortable. Service was adequate. The charcuterie board was tasty, but also pretty large despite being included in the “sorta hungry” part of the menu, so bring a very empty stomach if you want it."
Field Guide,Canadian (New),"2076 Gottingen Street Halifax, NS B3K 3B4 Canada",NS,44.6514864,-63.5828036,4,"We stopped in here a few weeks ago for a mid day drinks and some apps! Their cocktail menu was fun to look at and I ended up going with the Pandan one which was delicious! Foodwise, we ordered oysters and one of each of the baos. Though we’re not vegetarian, the mushroom baos are a MUST try. So incredibly flavourful and melt in your mouth, we could’ve ordered another ten of them.

Lots of seating options and they were pretty full when we arrived so would recommend making reservations!"
Field Guide,Canadian (New),"2076 Gottingen Street Halifax, NS B3K 3B4 Canada",NS,44.6514864,-63.5828036,5,"Always thought this place was lovely for cocktails and snacks, however, the “Let us decide for you” option was 5+ stars! We loved every bite and discovered new favs.

Our favorites (in order of most favorite):
1) seared scallops with cannellini beans
2) rhubarb upside down cake
3) tuna and turnips
4) fresh oysters with house made strawberry? Mignonette and hot sauces
5) the prettiest potato salad on earth

P.S. All the cocktails we had were perfection. I loved the nonino fresco (incredibly refreshing) and my partner enjoyed the campensino old fashioned."
Field Guide,Canadian (New),"2076 Gottingen Street Halifax, NS B3K 3B4 Canada",NS,44.6514864,-63.5828036,5,"Absolutely wonderful experience end-to-end from Field Guide. This was our second time visiting Field Guide for dinner, and it was just as good as the first, if not better.

We chose bar seats right in front of the open tiny kitchen and enjoyed chatting with the cooks during service. Everyone - The bartender, the hosts, and the cooks were personable, fun, and attentive.

The drinks were inventive and well balanced, exactly what I'd expect from an eclectic bar on Queen West in Toronto, but much closer to home. Food came out at a reasonable pace, which considering the size of the kitchen (Three cooks in something smaller than apartment kitchens I've had before! A single 30"" Induction range!) is impressive. I'd say we made a mistake doing 6 of the larger plates between two people, but we managed to down it all. Everything was well balanced and approachable, with a huge focus put on texture - Incredibly well thought out from that standpoint.

We left completely satisfied and look forward to our next opportunity to visit. If more places took after Field Guide when it comes to hospitality and care, the world would be a better place.

Props!"
Field Guide,Canadian (New),"2076 Gottingen Street Halifax, NS B3K 3B4 Canada",NS,44.6514864,-63.5828036,5,"All around AMAZING! Im quite particular about my food and drinks, and this place did a fantastic job of creating a summer fresh, delicious and creative menu (with great service). I had minor critiques, but overall was in love and would return and recommend to anyone.

Food: We started with the bread and mussels. Best mussels we’ve ever had, as they were cooked perfectly (and fresh) and the broth was heaven. The bread pairing was perfect to soak up all the buttery broth goodness. Next was the Shrimp Bao. The bread was fluffy and light, and shrimp was at chilled room temperature, perfect for a summer day. A good flavour of celery in case you dislike that, but I’d still suggest you try it! Finally we had the Zucchini and Beef Tartare. Zucchini didn’t wow, though still fresh and summer minty vibes. Beef Tartare…hands down best we’ve ever had. The Asian fusion incorporated was perfect. Closed it out with a Strawberry & Cream, which albeit simpler was well done.

Drinks: Go for them all. Very creative and they can walk you through tasting notes perfectly. Milk Punch (method; not actually milk; recommend), Strawberry Basil Negroni (strongly recommend; not traditional negroni alcohol forward), Eucalyptus Sour (subtle, calm and collected; recommend), Corn Star (be adventurous, as the chipotle is super subtle; worth the risk; recommend), Vesper (again, not alcohol forward; recommend).

Atmosphere: Cozy and charming, yet the accents are vibrant and energizing. Indoor volume is medium, and great for a family, cocktail, date or a “i want a nice drink/bite” any day of the week."
Highwayman,Cocktail Bars,"1673 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1Z9 Canada",NS,44.6469956,-63.5736963,5,"So good! We went for happy hour and it's an absolute steal. If this place was in Paris, NY, LA, etc. it would be absolutely packed from 4 to 5. Excellent platters and oysters, $10 cocktails, and a cool but unpretentious vibe. We'll definitely be back!"
Highwayman,Cocktail Bars,"1673 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1Z9 Canada",NS,44.6469956,-63.5736963,5,"Had a fabulous experience here! Went for dinner and drinks with my brother and his wife and the staff were truly fantastic. I hope they all get the recognition they deserve because they made the whole experience worthwhile. Whether you're seated at a table or posted at the bar, the fun and elegant atmosphere helped set the scene for some delicious nibbles from the wide ranging menu. The Mushroom Risotto with Saffron & Manchego is heavenly and has to be tried. Booking is essential during busy times."
Highwayman,Cocktail Bars,"1673 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1Z9 Canada",NS,44.6469956,-63.5736963,5,"A colleague recommended this place. Wow am I glad I visited. It was a difficult choice and I’m so glad I went with the croquetas, they were crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. The I had the pork belly and scallops. Great food and presentation, great staff with interactions with a few of them."
Highwayman,Cocktail Bars,"1673 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1Z9 Canada",NS,44.6469956,-63.5736963,4,"Highway man was good but I think it’s a little overrated if you ask me.

The drinks are priced higher than most restaurants in the area but they are delicious. You can tell that a mixologist made the drinks instead of a regular bartender.

Don’t expect to leave here full. The sharing platter don’t come with much food.

As a group of six we spent almost 600 dollars on drinks and food and still had to go elsewhere for dinner."
Highwayman,Cocktail Bars,"1673 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1Z9 Canada",NS,44.6469956,-63.5736963,4,"Was a decent experience as I was from out of town. I found it was a little difficult to get the waitress attention once we had our drinks as we are being ignored.

The drinks had been pretty good and the atmosphere itself was nice. It's pretty dark ! You don't need a reservation if you go during the week but I suspect you'd need one of you go Friday night or weekend evenings."
Pho Hoang Minh Vietnamese Restaurant,Vietnamese,"172 Wyse Road Dartmouth, NS B3A 1M6 Canada",NS,44.6718928,-63.5796133,3,The food and service is great as a family type restaurant.  But I was not informed about them charging extra 4% for paying with credit card.
Pho Hoang Minh Vietnamese Restaurant,Vietnamese,"172 Wyse Road Dartmouth, NS B3A 1M6 Canada",NS,44.6718928,-63.5796133,5,"I will always be a #1 fan of Pho Hoang Minh Restaurant. While living in Dartmouth, it was a go to for us when I worked just nearby. And now that I don't live near the city at all, every time I'm driving by and know they're open, I will always stop for the famous #15 meal. I've shared my love for Pho Hoang Minh Restaurant with everyone and will always recommend it. The perfect flavors of the #15 are a staple. My husband and family members also really enjoy the Chinese combination meals. Everything is amazing!"
Pho Hoang Minh Vietnamese Restaurant,Vietnamese,"172 Wyse Road Dartmouth, NS B3A 1M6 Canada",NS,44.6718928,-63.5796133,5,"They do both Vietnamese and Chinese food but I would only go there for the Vietnamese dishes. I've had the Pho and noodle bowl, both are as good as any I've had in Asia.

It's a no frills place so don't expect any ambiance but the price reflects that. It's good food at a reasonable price and there's not many of those kinds of places left these days."
Pho Hoang Minh Vietnamese Restaurant,Vietnamese,"172 Wyse Road Dartmouth, NS B3A 1M6 Canada",NS,44.6718928,-63.5796133,4,"Fast service, large portions, and a big menu. We ordered the beef pho and the pork and vermicelli dish and both came out within 5 minutes. The bbq pork that came was the vermicelli was delicious and had a smokey flavour and the beef strips in the pho had a bit of red to it when it came out but cooked well in the broth. One thing I didn’t enjoy was having a view of the kitchen while eating and watching the chef cut up the raw meat while eating. Otherwise good Vietnamese restaurant in a convenient location with lots of parking."
Pho Hoang Minh Vietnamese Restaurant,Vietnamese,"172 Wyse Road Dartmouth, NS B3A 1M6 Canada",NS,44.6718928,-63.5796133,5,"Very good food. I really enjoy seeing the boss cut up the meat from the restaurant through to the kitchen. At least this way I know it did not come out of a bucket of saline SLIMEY solution, like some of the other restaurants. This is very fresh honest food.

a very good family business. Very nice"
Stone Pizza,Pizza,"79 Alderney Drive Dartmouth, NS B2Y 2N7 Canada",NS,44.6645555,-63.5682578,3,"I recently had the pleasure of trying pizza at the stone pizza shop, and I must say it was unique but average rating as per taste. The stone pizza, also known as a brick oven pizza, is prepared using a traditional method of baking pizza on a stone surface inside a wood- fired oven. Here’s my detailed review-

Crust- the crust of the stone pizza was not baked properly. We would love to eat well baked crust.

Toppings- There are multiple options of toppings and you can change your toppings with the other available toppings just in case of you don’t like any toppings. Like we replaced the top oh my veggies pizza from olives - jalapeño and mushrooms- pine apples.

Presentation- The stone pizza was visually appealing. The pizza came out of the oven with a beautiful golden crust and the toppings were artfully arranged. The aroma wafting from the pizza was irresistible making the presentation even more enticing.

Classics pep and cheese - I didn’t like the taste of it, although presentation wise it was tempting."
Stone Pizza,Pizza,"79 Alderney Drive Dartmouth, NS B2Y 2N7 Canada",NS,44.6645555,-63.5682578,1,"Tried this place as the reviews seemed good, unfortunately will be the first and last time I will order from this place.

The pepperoni pizza was a 0/10 the cheese seemed curdled & not even melted.

Dough was not fully cooked through & raw under toppings.

I'm sorry to leave this review, but I am extremely dissapointed."
Stone Pizza,Pizza,"79 Alderney Drive Dartmouth, NS B2Y 2N7 Canada",NS,44.6645555,-63.5682578,3,"I'm a little torn, this was my first time having Stone Pizza. Ordered a personal size Hawaiian pizza, and one of the oreo dessert pizzas.  My Hawaiian pizza was delicious,  but my oreo dessert pizza looks and tastes as if the crust was barely cooked...which is really unfortunate"
Stone Pizza,Pizza,"79 Alderney Drive Dartmouth, NS B2Y 2N7 Canada",NS,44.6645555,-63.5682578,1,"Ordered a donair pizza and was so disappointed, when I placed the order was told it would be ready in 10 minutes which was not typical of when I ordered from Stone in the past as they are my go to for pizza take out. It was evident that this pizza had been prepared much earlier and was reheated the outer edge crust was very crisp. And the donair meat was dry, called to let them know and received an apology that it was not up to my standards, however it was more important to note not up to their standards, the person I spoke with was very curt until I said I was not looking for a refund but making them aware I was disappointed, this makes me rethink my pizza choice moving forward."
Stone Pizza,Pizza,"79 Alderney Drive Dartmouth, NS B2Y 2N7 Canada",NS,44.6645555,-63.5682578,5,Tried this place today for dinner and had delivered.

Large menu, so it wasn't easy to make a decision. I finally chose the assorted maki [number 6 under Sushi Combo]. What a delight! The ingredients were fresh and the flavours were spot-on. The miso soup was lovely, too [rich flavours].

The staff was friendly, and although busy, the service was quick. The prep area reminded me of a restaurant you would find in Japan.

My only suggestion is better chopsticks, please. I've been eating with chopsticks for 20-plus years and the wooden ones wrapped in paper are truly awful!

Thank you for a great dining experience. I will be back!!"

We got a Green Dragon & Ninja roll and 2 types of Ramen: Seafood & Hokkaido. It was awesome!  Hokkaido ramen recommend for all who are fans of spicy food! Seafood ramen (scallops,  shrimps,  calamari ) just 🧡
The dish was so big; we were unable to finish it 😊

I highly recommend trying this place out!"

Seated with no menus, takes 30 minutes to get water, food arrives before drinks and cutlery. Really hoping this changes so we can continue enjoying this awesome restaurant!"

I would give 3 stars for hotpot since i still cannot find the right dipping sauce. We had tried peanut sauce but it was too bland. However, because of their pan fried dumpling was so good. There a plenty of ground pork inside and it is only $10. So i have to add 1 more star for them. It seem that their a la carte menu will be much better to try.

Reduced star down to 1 since this restaurant has no parking spot and provide no info for facilitate customer like me to park. And i got $115 ticket from their building on top of my 15% tip to their foods and service. Extremely bad experience. Will never come to pay any cent to this business.

I would give 3 stars for hotpot since i still cannot find the right dipping sauce. We had tried peanut sauce but it was too bland. However, because of their pan fried dumpling was so good. There a plenty of ground pork inside and it is only $10. So i have to add 1 more star for them. It seem that their a la carte menu will be much better to try. It looks so good by observing from the other dining table."

The mussels were great really need a spoon for the delicious sauce. The Coquille and Seafood Crepes are very good  and the seafood was very fresh. I forgot how good the lemon parfait pie is , next time I will get the large portion.

Our server reflected the professionalism of the hands on owner Liz. We really enjoyed our evening dinner."

Le Bistro By Liz,French,"1333 S Park Street Halifax, NS B3J 2K9 Canada",NS,44.6405701,-63.5782145,4,"On a visit to Halifax for a conference, coincidentally ended up here three times - twice for lunch and once for dinner. The food was great! The service was awesome too. We had a great time! Would highly recommend if you are in the area. Don’t let the oddness of it being at the bottom of an apartment building put you off. It’s worth the trip to Liz’s."
Heng Fung Restaurant,Chinese,"179 Wyse Road Dartmouth, NS B3A Canada",NS,44.6725401,-63.5824532,1,"Honestly have nothing good to say. The number of decent reviews is astonishing. I don’t like to hate on businesses especially on local ones, but I also want to help others make informed decisions on where they’re going to spend their money and what they’re going to eat.

I ordered takeout by phone. Someone answered the phone, hurriedly said they would put me on hold and then proceeded to just leave me on the line without actually putting me on hold so I could hear everyone talking in the kitchen but had no idea when I would actually be helped. Finally, I was served by someone and she was nice enough but then as soon as I was done going through the order she abruptly said “bye” without asking me my name for the pickup or giving me an estimation for when it would be ready. She didn’t actually hang up so I was once again just left sitting on the other end of the line, but no one was there to listen to my questions.

Finally got our food and while the portion sizes were enormous, the food itself was just horribly bland. It looked like it had sauce on it but somehow there was literally no flavour. Basically eating super greasy food without any good taste experience to make up for it. Also, I ordered the eggplant off of the vegetable section of the menu assuming it was vegetarian and it was full of beef. I get that this was partially my fault for not double checking, but putting a meat dish under the vegetable section and not indicating anywhere that there is meat in it is just horrible business protocol.

On the whole, this experience was bad enough for me to never return."
Heng Fung Restaurant,Chinese,"179 Wyse Road Dartmouth, NS B3A Canada",NS,44.6725401,-63.5824532,5,"Super impressed with the size pf the serving. 👏🏻

Honey garlic ribs are great, egg rolls ate awesome, beef broccoli is also a must try, the wanton is also superb. I dont personally like the chicken balls though (i think that’s what it’s called). But overall, it was super great experience to eat here. We ended up taking out a huge portion of our meals. If you are not a big eater, a serving can be good for sharing. 😊"
Heng Fung Restaurant,Chinese,"179 Wyse Road Dartmouth, NS B3A Canada",NS,44.6725401,-63.5824532,3,"So my boyfriend and I called trying to place an order for delivery at 8:30 pm, we're home with a new baby, exhausted , and don't want to cook because we are tired. the restaurant closes at 9pm. Now I've worked in food service, and the last time I checked you have to serve the customer UNTIL CLOSING. If I call a pizza place at 9:50 and they close at 10pm, they still deliver. Anywho the lady who answered the phone refused to serve us and said ""we stop taking orders at 8:30"" ma'am ? Do you want to make money ? We can order on doordash and get our food delivered with you guys but your delivery driver doesn't want to work passed 8:30? Or your cooks don't want to cook? Whatever the case may be fix it because you're going to lose money like that."
Heng Fung Restaurant,Chinese,"179 Wyse Road Dartmouth, NS B3A Canada",NS,44.6725401,-63.5824532,1,"Food is average.  One star rating is because upon request of pkg of Soy Sauce for my rice, I was told they have none and haven't had since Covid.  Tell me...what Chinese food restaurant has no Soy Sauce???  Unbelievable.  Had I known before having ordered and paid for my combo plate, I would have gone elsewhere.  If you are getting takeout and want Soy Sauce...avoid this place.  Ridiculous."
Heng Fung Restaurant,Chinese,"179 Wyse Road Dartmouth, NS B3A Canada",NS,44.6725401,-63.5824532,5,"If your looking for tasty chinese food in hrm dont waste any time just come here.
Chicken su guy was amazing
Big portions
Cherry sauce on the chicken balls. chow main awesome beef/ veg was crazy tasty.
Egg rolls perfect"
East of Grafton Tavern,Bars,"1580 Argyle Street Halifax, NS B3J 1H5 Canada",NS,44.6454803,-63.5741249,3,"Went there seeing excellent reviews of food, doesn’t live upto hype. Wanted to try Mediterranean Nachos but they completely revised the menu as such. Tried normal nachos, chicken wings and another chicken dish ;wings were smelly and below average and can’t complain about nachos (serving is large for a single person). Overall, average, nothing to be hyped about!"
East of Grafton Tavern,Bars,"1580 Argyle Street Halifax, NS B3J 1H5 Canada",NS,44.6454803,-63.5741249,5,"Good place for half priced nachos and pub snacks from 4-6. The nachos ($9.50) were layered well with peppers, artichoke pieces and pickled onion, and had a good ratio of cheese to chip and amount of dip (sour cream, refried beans, fresh salsa). 3 Chicken sliders ($8) were tasty but not very filling. Sat outside on the patio and could hear music from The Pint across the street."
East of Grafton Tavern,Bars,"1580 Argyle Street Halifax, NS B3J 1H5 Canada",NS,44.6454803,-63.5741249,5,"Loved the nachos here! And our server was VERY busy (we could tell by all the new tables coming in) but she was very attentive to us. Great overall experience, we'll be back for sure."
East of Grafton Tavern,Bars,"1580 Argyle Street Halifax, NS B3J 1H5 Canada",NS,44.6454803,-63.5741249,3,"With the name gastropub, we were expecting higher quality food.
The beer was fine but the fish n chips was more on the store bought / freezer side. Shocking since when we asked the server he said it was a popular dish.
Also the Fries felt like they were refried, stale almost. Nice looking place and ambiance for drinks, not sure we would go back for the food."
East of Grafton Tavern,Bars,"1580 Argyle Street Halifax, NS B3J 1H5 Canada",NS,44.6454803,-63.5741249,5,We wandered around downtown Halifax until we were hungry and came across this adorable bar right in time for happy hour. This seems to be a favourite among the locals because they said in a few hours they'd be full with reservations. The cocktails were fantastic and I would definitely come back with friends for dinner and drinks. A great place for a date too.
Cha Baa Thai,Thai,"100 Ilsley Avenue Dartmouth, NS B3B 1L3 Canada",NS,44.6995214,-63.5871876,5,"Their food is always delicious.  If you are looking for a good, tasty, and fast Thai food at lunch, I would highly recommend!  Best to arrive at 11:30 to avoid a Friday wait...although the wait is usually not long"
Cha Baa Thai,Thai,"100 Ilsley Avenue Dartmouth, NS B3B 1L3 Canada",NS,44.6995214,-63.5871876,5,"This is an authentic Thai food.. I'm so glad to found this place.. this  Thai noodles soup is the killer, this is exactly why I'm here for.. the staffs and cooks are really awesome!"
Cha Baa Thai,Thai,"100 Ilsley Avenue Dartmouth, NS B3B 1L3 Canada",NS,44.6995214,-63.5871876,5,"Some of the best Pad Thai in HRM. Anytime I'm up in this side of the city I always make an effort to stop by Cha Baa Thai. The store is always clean and tidy. The staff are always friendly, quick and prompt. The food is always incredible! Can't say enough good things. Love this spot"
Cha Baa Thai,Thai,"100 Ilsley Avenue Dartmouth, NS B3B 1L3 Canada",NS,44.6995214,-63.5871876,5,"The best Massaman Curry and Black Pepper Beef I've had! Always excellent and prompt with service, polite and professional . Takeaway is usually about 15 minutes, so if you're ordering for lunch in Burnside, call ahead and they have it ready at the counter still piping hot.
The food is excellent, no matter what you get. It's hard to try something new on the menu, because everything is SO good that you want one of everything!

Definitely recommend."
Cha Baa Thai,Thai,"100 Ilsley Avenue Dartmouth, NS B3B 1L3 Canada",NS,44.6995214,-63.5871876,5,We dined in for lunch and enjoyed Delicious Thai food cooked up fresh!  Friendly fast service and reasonable prices. What’s not to love?  We’ll definitely be back…..
Cha Baa Thai,Thai,"1546 Queen St Halifax, NS B3J 2H8 Canada",NS,44.6440209,-63.577071,4,Good Thai Food with pleasant ambience. The drinks were bit below average but no complaints from the food. Pad thai was the standout followed by the Red curry and Cashew Chicken. The quantity is quite good and can be shared by two people(with rice or sides)
Cha Baa Thai,Thai,"1546 Queen St Halifax, NS B3J 2H8 Canada",NS,44.6440209,-63.577071,3,"The restaurant was nice, the staff was friendly, the cashew chicken was delicious, but unfortunately the spring rolls were not fresh, they were sour. Fried noodles taste sweet and sour, but it will be a little greasy, not recommended to try. Thai coffee tastes a little more weepy and creamy."
Cha Baa Thai,Thai,"1546 Queen St Halifax, NS B3J 2H8 Canada",NS,44.6440209,-63.577071,5,"Great spot for a delicious and authentic Thai meal.

The restaurant's Pad Thai is a delightful mix of stir-fried rice noodles, vegetables, peanuts, and beef. The Pad Thai is served in generous portions, perfect for both lunch or dinner.

Wonton soup was surprisingly relexing, strongly recommend as well."
Cha Baa Thai,Thai,"1546 Queen St Halifax, NS B3J 2H8 Canada",NS,44.6440209,-63.577071,5,"Very nice experience. I ordered the red curry chicken. The curry was full of flavor and the portion was perfect.

They even gave me extra chicken because I didn't want the egg roll that comes with it since I'm gluten free.

Will definitely be going back !"
Cha Baa Thai,Thai,"1546 Queen St Halifax, NS B3J 2H8 Canada",NS,44.6440209,-63.577071,5,"Wow, probably the best Thai food I’ve ever had!(haven’t had much but this was exceptional) the flavors of my green curry chicken lunch special and coconut soup were out of this world. The Thai iced coffee was strong and sweet and my friends Thai iced tea was such a sweet and unique flavor. If you are in downtown Halifax or around the other location in Dartmouth you gotta go here for some of the best Thai food in Halifax."
Dhaba,Indian,"8 Oland Crescent Halifax, NS B3S 1C6 Canada",NS,44.6470008,-63.6756622,5,"I absolutely classify Dhaba Express as a hidden gem of Halifax. I have only ever gone for the weekend buffet and it has been stellar each and every time. On my most recent visit I fell in love with the samosa chat and the punjabi chicken.

I highly, highly recommend."
Dhaba,Indian,"8 Oland Crescent Halifax, NS B3S 1C6 Canada",NS,44.6470008,-63.6756622,5,"We were drawn here by the aromas as we passed on our way to CBSA nearby. We had a lovely lunch which was very tasty. We chose what was on special, recommended by the waitress.  The staff were friendly, welcoming and efficient.
Very good curry."
Dhaba,Indian,"8 Oland Crescent Halifax, NS B3S 1C6 Canada",NS,44.6470008,-63.6756622,5,"Amazing food always. Saturday Buffet is Worth trying. Everything is super tasty.

Update:
Came back for the buffet again. Pleasantly surprised with the menu. Always new items to try."
Dhaba,Indian,"8 Oland Crescent Halifax, NS B3S 1C6 Canada",NS,44.6470008,-63.6756622,4,"Food is tasty, but butter chicken had a sweet and sour taste, did not like that. Thandoori chicken curry is also very delicious. Butter naan is super big, One is enough to fill your stomach. Authentic Indian taste."
Dhaba,Indian,"8 Oland Crescent Halifax, NS B3S 1C6 Canada",NS,44.6470008,-63.6756622,1,"The worst Indian meal we have ever had and we have eaten at many excellent Indian restaurants.  This is definitely one of them.  Where do we start - the “nan” is unlike any we have ever eaten it is more like a flat bread.  The curry had loads of grease and hardly any chicken.  The rice is not like regular saffron rice, which is much finer.  The pics speak for themselves.  It was expensive for sub-standard food and we won’t be returning."
Blue Elephant,Thai,"81 Peakview Way Unit 100 Bedford, NS B3M 0G2 Canada",NS,44.6983757,-63.6850746,5,"Top-Notch!

We went to Blue Elephant for lunch, and it’s one of the best Thai food in town.

I have been to almost all the Thai places in town, and by far, the best experience in terms of food, ambience and hospitality - Blue Elephant.

If you struggle to choose as all options excite you, SALLY will jump in to help. She is the nicest to the core and one person who does everything - Taking orders, delivering the food, billing and cleaning. Uff - hats off to you!

Since we went on a weekday, their inventory for drinks where missing a few to try cocktails, but it’s understandable.

Overall - if you like Thai, you must try Blue Elephant at least once before you stick with your regular Thai place.

Good luck, Blue Elephant crew; we will return soon with a big crowd of friends and families."
Blue Elephant,Thai,"81 Peakview Way Unit 100 Bedford, NS B3M 0G2 Canada",NS,44.6983757,-63.6850746,3,"We ordered shrimp pad thai and spring rolls for take out. The food, service, and atmosphere were average to us. It would have been nice to have some fresh green onion and bean sprouts in the pad thai."
Blue Elephant,Thai,"81 Peakview Way Unit 100 Bedford, NS B3M 0G2 Canada",NS,44.6983757,-63.6850746,5,"Loved the decor, the ambience and the vibe. DID NOT like the phone constantly ringing and no one answering the phone...very distracting and annoying.  We had the spring rolls (good) and wings (good, nothing special) for appetizers.  Our main was the Pad Thai, which was DELICIOUS!! One if the best we had!! Waitress was very apologetic for the long wait and mix up with the spring rolls. Was a good experience and will probably be back to give it another chance.

Back again and had the Cashew chicken and ginger beef...the chicken will be my go-to order!!! Soooooo good!!"
Blue Elephant,Thai,"81 Peakview Way Unit 100 Bedford, NS B3M 0G2 Canada",NS,44.6983757,-63.6850746,5,"My wife and I had an amazing experience here. We shared the fresh spring rolls which were excellent, and the dipping sauce was delicious!
We also had the Pad Thai, and the Red Curry which was also amazing.
Everything was so fresh, the portion sizes were great, the staff was extremely friendly.
We will definitely be coming back here, despite it being out of our way.
My only regret was not taking photos of the food as we devoured everything because it was so good!"
Blue Elephant,Thai,"81 Peakview Way Unit 100 Bedford, NS B3M 0G2 Canada",NS,44.6983757,-63.6850746,5,"Good portions and taste, will definitely come back.

4 months have gone by, sat and ate in once. Food was still really good, service was a little slow (server seemed to be busy trying to keep up).

Delivery was tonight and whilst there's a $10 charge for the service (you're going to be paying that on Uber or Skip with all their fees), the food got to me an hour from when I placed my order (exactly when the lady on the phone said it would). Everything was piping hot and just as good as every other experience. Wish I gave a little bit more of a tip to the driver but I didn't want to leave a big tip and find my food cold afterwards. Will definitely be ordering again.

Ginger beef is a 10/10"
Boneheads BBQ,Southern,"1014 Barrington St Halifax, NS B3H 2P9 Canada",NS,44.6363998,-63.5696948,4,"Staff are friendly, limited street parking. Pulled pork and pork ribs were great, but the brisket didn't really have a smokey flavour that I would expect. Sweet potato chips, cornbread and beans were good."
Boneheads BBQ,Southern,"1014 Barrington St Halifax, NS B3H 2P9 Canada",NS,44.6363998,-63.5696948,5,"Omg this BBQ was soooo good!!!!! Would highly recommend to anyone who likes BBQ! I got the chicken sandwich meal. We ate there, which I thought was even better. They have different sauces at the table!"
Boneheads BBQ,Southern,"1014 Barrington St Halifax, NS B3H 2P9 Canada",NS,44.6363998,-63.5696948,3,"Food wasn't very good. Pulled pork was only thing that had flavor, everything else was bland or just average.

The worst was the brisket! Absolutely bone dry and no flavor whatsoever. Possible the worst I've ever had.

Staff was very friendly however."
Boneheads BBQ,Southern,"1014 Barrington St Halifax, NS B3H 2P9 Canada",NS,44.6363998,-63.5696948,5,"We got the 3-meat combo: double order of ribs and sausage (they had run out of brisket and chicken). Ribs were great, sausage was good. Sauces were delicious (especially the gravy), tasty cornbread and coleslaw.
They forgot several components of our order, which we checked before we left. They were apologetic, but just FYI to check your takeout bag before you leave."
Boneheads BBQ,Southern,"1014 Barrington St Halifax, NS B3H 2P9 Canada",NS,44.6363998,-63.5696948,2,"Small space, they have two tables I believe but not really a sit and eat kind of place. Had the pull pork sandwich with dirty rice. The dirty rice was bland, and the pull pork could have used more of the bbq sauce. There are better BBQ options out there. They also need a better system for pick up. Everyone was waiting in the same line if you were placing an order or just picking up."
Gangnam Korean BBQ,Korean,"1261 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1Y2 Canada",NS,44.6412953,-63.5707432,5,"An absolutely incredible experience 🤩
We ordered the Everything Combo for 3 people, Pork Bone Hot Pot for 2 people and Eel rice bowl. We love everything so much!! The portions were enormous with very reasonable price, even though it's located conveniently right in downtown Halifax.
It could be a bit tricky finding parking spots, so you may expect some walking uphill to get there."
Gangnam Korean BBQ,Korean,"1261 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1Y2 Canada",NS,44.6412953,-63.5707432,5,Great Korean food restaurant. Been there few times with family and friends. The price and quantity are balanced. Service is reasonable and not generally delayed. Would go back at some point.
Gangnam Korean BBQ,Korean,"1261 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1Y2 Canada",NS,44.6412953,-63.5707432,5,"As a connoisseur of Korean cuisine, I must say that the Korean BBQ restaurant located in the center of downtown Halifax is a standout establishment that truly excels in every aspect.

First and foremost, the service was impeccable. The staff were not only attentive and efficient, but also welcoming and hospitable, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere for diners.

In terms of atmosphere, the restaurant is tastefully decorated with traditional Korean elements, giving it a sense of authenticity and cultural immersion. The energy of the restaurant was lively and dynamic, making for a truly enjoyable dining experience.

Now, onto the food. The selection of meats offered at the BBQ was diverse and of the highest quality, expertly prepared and cooked to perfection. The accompanying ""banchan,"" or side dishes, were also a delight, offering a plethora of flavors and textures that enhanced the overall meal.

In conclusion, it is with the utmost conviction that I highly recommend this Korean BBQ restaurant to anyone seeking a truly exceptional dining experience. The combination of excellent service, authentic atmosphere, and delicious food make it a must-try for anyone in the Halifax area."
Gangnam Korean BBQ,Korean,"1261 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1Y2 Canada",NS,44.6412953,-63.5707432,4,"Korean BBQ was a hit, delicious meat and servers were fast to replenish. The one downside we found was that the hot pot we found lacking, overwhelmed with pork bones and barely any soup, and most places have deeper pans for the soup. Service was excellent just the hot pot was lacking."
Gangnam Korean BBQ,Korean,"1261 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1Y2 Canada",NS,44.6412953,-63.5707432,4,"The service was kind and efficient, the meal was hot and savoury,  and the price was truly good value for the quality of food.

We tried the bulgogi, the spicy chicken, and the Kimchi soup and the word ‘delicious’ was tossed around the table many times.

I highly recommend this restaurant for authentic Korean dishes."
I Love Pho,Vietnamese,"746 Bedford Highway Halifax, NS B3M 2L9 Canada",NS,44.7067907,-63.6649239,4,"Attended this restaurant after a friend’s recommendation! Delicious pho, but it’s very important to know that when they write “spicy” on the menu, they really mean it. Ordered the spiciest pho on the menu and was only able to eat a quarter of the bowl before my mouth was too swollen. Most painful meal ever, but such a delicious flavour. The space is a bit crowded, though the service is excellent. Can’t wait to go again and order a less spicy dish to fully enjoy the experience!"
I Love Pho,Vietnamese,"746 Bedford Highway Halifax, NS B3M 2L9 Canada",NS,44.7067907,-63.6649239,4,"I am a frequent I Love Pho customer, mainly for their Pho and Bun Bo Hue. I highly recommended both, they taste very good with decent portion. The restaurant itself is small but cozy, and the waiter is always helpful and friendly."
I Love Pho,Vietnamese,"746 Bedford Highway Halifax, NS B3M 2L9 Canada",NS,44.7067907,-63.6649239,5,Great place to eat traditional Vietnamese food! You can tell that the Pho is made fresh using fresh ingredients! Very tasty soup! The sandwich brought me back memories! It’s like as if you were in any vendor in Hanoi! Delicious!!! Highly recommended!!
I Love Pho,Vietnamese,"746 Bedford Highway Halifax, NS B3M 2L9 Canada",NS,44.7067907,-63.6649239,2,"We came here twice in July and our first experience with the restaurant was pretty good. Pho was good and the service was also nice. We stopped by again on Wednesday, July 19th and it was quite rainy out but we asked if we could sit at the patio. The server said something but we didn’t get it clear, so it was our fault for not confirming his answer and headed out to the patio. Around 5 minutes later he peeked his head out, not coming out and telling us properly, peeked his head out and told us “I said no patio”, I’m quoting him now because it was so impressive how he talked to customers. Quite disappointing because we like the food there and our other server was really nice. We left after that and did not get food."
I Love Pho,Vietnamese,"746 Bedford Highway Halifax, NS B3M 2L9 Canada",NS,44.7067907,-63.6649239,5,Delicious pho!! Spring rolls are very crispy. Always my pho go to place :D
Bluenose II Restaurant,Seafood,"1824 Hollis Street Halifax, NS B3J 1W4 Canada",NS,44.649309,-63.573854,4,We enjoyed going to this restaurant on a recent holiday in Halifax. I had scallops which were good - not that big though - we also ordered the salmon and the calamari- the calamari was great - the salmon was a little overcooked but tasty. We each had a drink from the bar which we found to be very reasonably priced. The atmosphere was casual and the service was friendly. I would go back :)
Bluenose II Restaurant,Seafood,"1824 Hollis Street Halifax, NS B3J 1W4 Canada",NS,44.649309,-63.573854,5,"Wow, i fell in love with this place.
I ordered the lobster dinner, and it was super delicious! It cam with clam chowder which was rich and creamy! It also came with a side and i choose mash potato which was amazing! The other side dish we ordered calamari was also delicious. The dessert was also very filling! Delicious as well.
I will definitely come back to Bluenose II when/if I ever travel back to Halifax!"
Bluenose II Restaurant,Seafood,"1824 Hollis Street Halifax, NS B3J 1W4 Canada",NS,44.649309,-63.573854,5,"So happy we went here during my recent vacation to Halifax.

Bluenose II Restaurant,Seafood,"1824 Hollis Street Halifax, NS B3J 1W4 Canada",NS,44.649309,-63.573854,5,"I recently visited Bluenose II in Halifax with my wife for a delightful lunchtime experience. This charming restaurant exceeded our expectations with its delectable seafood, cozy ambiance, and attentive service.

First and foremost, the food at Bluenose II is a true delight for seafood lovers. We indulged in an array of mouthwatering dishes, from succulent lobster rolls to perfectly seared scallops. Each bite was bursting with freshness and flavors of the sea, making for an exceptional dining experience.

The restaurant's interior exudes a comfortable and inviting atmosphere. The maritime-themed decor and beautiful seafaring artwork created a unique and enchanting ambiance. We particularly enjoyed sitting by the window, which offered a pleasant view of the bustling street outside. It was the perfect spot to unwind and soak in the relaxed vibes.

The service at Bluenose II was commendable. The staff members were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. They were prompt in taking our orders and made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal. Their warm and accommodating nature added to the overall positive experience.

In conclusion, our visit to Bluenose II was a delightful journey into maritime cuisine. The delectable seafood, comfortable surroundings, and attentive service made for a memorable dining experience. Whether you're a seafood enthusiast or simply seeking a relaxed and enjoyable meal, Bluenose II in Halifax is a fantastic choice."
Bluenose II Restaurant,Seafood,"1824 Hollis Street Halifax, NS B3J 1W4 Canada",NS,44.649309,-63.573854,4,"The food was good. Very quick, tasty, and fairly priced.
Service was meeting the bare minimum. The service was quick but the server never topped up our waters or even chatted with us. It was definitely efficient, but it felt like a get in and get out kind of dining experience. Then to have the lowest pre-set option for tipping to be 18% was shocking considering all that.
The restaurant was almost full when I went, so it was loud and difficult to have a conversation. I felt rushed to eat and leave since it was so busy."
Sushi Nami Royale,Sushi Bars,"149 Hector Gate Dartmouth, NS B3B 0E5 Canada",NS,44.7052262,-63.5626061,5,"Best sushi on the East Coast! Amazing service, atmosphere & fresh sushi that is always perfect. Dine in or take out. Gonna miss this place so much after living here for 7 years. We will be back when we come & visit the maritimes."
Sushi Nami Royale,Sushi Bars,"149 Hector Gate Dartmouth, NS B3B 0E5 Canada",NS,44.7052262,-63.5626061,3,"Visited from Toronto and first time trying restaurant. They had a good variety of selections.  I chose the dinner special with soup and salad which were both very good.  The sushi plate had California roll, spicy tuna, assorted sushi and sashimi.  The platter was good but sashimi was cut a bit too thick.  I have eaten a lot of sushi and sushi Nami was just okay."
Sushi Nami Royale,Sushi Bars,"149 Hector Gate Dartmouth, NS B3B 0E5 Canada",NS,44.7052262,-63.5626061,5,Had our lunch. They open 12nn every Sunday. We came early around 11 am. They charge extra 15% service fee if you exceed 5 person. We are 6 but it's considerable because they got nice and good service Nd food
Sushi Nami Royale,Sushi Bars,"149 Hector Gate Dartmouth, NS B3B 0E5 Canada",NS,44.7052262,-63.5626061,5,"Canada day lunch! Awesome Sushi, delicious desserts and overall a wonderful experience."

Sushi Nami Royale,Sushi Bars,"1458 Queen Street Suite 102 Halifax, NS B3J 2H7 Canada",NS,44.6423127,-63.5760024,5,The food is always delicious and comes out fast. I love getting a bunch of appetizers and having small dishes and it's a great place for that.
Sushi Nami Royale,Sushi Bars,"1458 Queen Street Suite 102 Halifax, NS B3J 2H7 Canada",NS,44.6423127,-63.5760024,5,"This is a pretty decent sushi restaurant, middling food but not terrible. They have a wide variety of options if you want to explore some new flavors.

The interior design and atmosphere is probably the best part about this place - a wide sushi bar takes up the middle of the space, and the entire restaurant is slightly sunken into the building which makes it feel a little quieter despite being right downtown.

They have a pretty nice variety of beverages, including an interesting ramune flavored drink which I would recommend if it's still available."
Sushi Nami Royale,Sushi Bars,"1458 Queen Street Suite 102 Halifax, NS B3J 2H7 Canada",NS,44.6423127,-63.5760024,3,"Went to get sushi downtown for a lunch date with a friend. I ordered the Maki Lunch, providing me with a delicious plate full of rolls. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very nice with kind servers to bring you your food. The miso soup was excellent and the spicy salmon rolls were very yummy. However, the house salad was not very good and some of the rolls had an uneven proportion of elements, making each bite slightly unbalanced. Overall, a good place to go for a reasonably priced sushi lunch deal."
Sushi Nami Royale,Sushi Bars,"1458 Queen Street Suite 102 Halifax, NS B3J 2H7 Canada",NS,44.6423127,-63.5760024,5,"Great, fresh sushi. The quality of the food makes up for any other shortcomings. I was there on a holiday weekend (Canada Day) and it was clear they were not prepared to be that busy. The staff was struggling to keep up. But once I finally got my food, it was amazing. Would definitely recommend to anyone."
Sushi Nami Royale,Sushi Bars,"1458 Queen Street Suite 102 Halifax, NS B3J 2H7 Canada",NS,44.6423127,-63.5760024,4,"The sashimi is a must: big chunks of melt-in-your-mouth salmon, tuna & escolar. This Cantonese-owned place has been a Halifax classic and I was happy to know they’re still open. This newer location has great decor and is very spacious! Waitress was very polite.

Rolls were somewhat of a letdown on the day we went, but tasted good. They are a bit loose, sparse and some classics like the dragon roll, while not bad here, didn’t taste as good as some other restaurants."

The only thing I would recommend is not to sit in the booths. They are attached  to each other, and every time you moved or the other table moved, it felt like a kid was sitting behind you kicking your seat."

St Louis Bar and Grill,Chicken Wings,"547 Portland Street Unit 1 & 2 Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4B1 Canada",NS,44.6714211,-63.5385775,1,"Asked the server about all you can eat, after 2 rounds of questions. Find out out the end all you can eat ended 2 days ago, they just didnt take down the signs. Didn't even bother ordering, took 25 minutes to ask what we'd like to order. This is not the first time I've had a bad experience here. Zero stars if i could."

It has definitely changed since the old manager left over a year ago. I sat on the patio and there was a gentleman vaping, clearly against the regulations governing eating/licensed establishments. Staff even sat with him while he was vaping.
Then to top it all off, the patio is littered with broken glass. Which shocked me, especially when the patio is suppose to be dog friendly.
To top it all off, the food was lukewarm"
Portland Street Creperie,Creperies,"55 Portland Street Dartmouth, NS B2Y 1H1 Canada",NS,44.6653186,-63.5671397,4,"The staff are nice. But, the portion is disappointing.  Stuffing is very little and the plate is for some reason so small that it is hard to avoid the food falling out of it. One scoop of ice cream was not really a complete one scoop. It is different from the pic I see in the past post. If the quantity was more generous, they would be for sure more popular.a coffee was a it small for the price, too:(.for lunch, one crepe may not satisfy you.  May need a cup of soup to go with it. Also, it is completely self service, so why tips are asked…?"

Additionally I also got the baseline and although I would have appreciated more bacon/banana filling inside, I definitely enjoyed the cook on the bacon. The staff was friendly and overall a good spot."

Portland Street Creperie,Creperies,"55 Portland Street Dartmouth, NS B2Y 1H1 Canada",NS,44.6653186,-63.5671397,5,"What a nice spot to stop in for quick brunch. The staff were incredibly lovely and the shop was clean. I personally wish there were more sweet crepe options with fruit that didn’t involve chocolate or cheesecake, but can’t do everything. When reading the savoury menu some of the options seem unusually, but they’re on there for a reason.

This building is wheelchair accessible, but it may be a little harder to navigate with mobility issues once inside, specifically if you come at a busy time. The washroom might be especially hard to reach in a wheelchair.

I wish there was a little bit of art or something on the walls, but overall so lovely!"
Portland Street Creperie,Creperies,"55 Portland Street Dartmouth, NS B2Y 1H1 Canada",NS,44.6653186,-63.5671397,5,"Spectacular in every way!

We had a lovely interactions with fellow customers before we even got inside. The atmosphere was friendly and wholesome inside, they even changed the music as different demographics of people came in.

We had a La Marais and they honoured an online only coupon to give us a Lemon Sugar Crêpe for free! Both were delicious and prepared perfectly.

The staff was friendly & engaging, and made us feel comfortable and at home.

Prices here are excellent! I haven't felt like I paid a reasonable price for a meal out in years.

A wonderful place, I highly recommend!"

The  design and atmosphere is outstanding.   The service was exceptional.  I wish I could recall my servers name but he did a terrific job.

I went for Brunch.  Menu was the right size.  The options made it tough to choose.   I had a cappuccino which was great.  Brasserie Breakfast and Duck Confit Hash were chosen.  Cinnamon Roll and Danish Pastry were add-ones.    Food was a 10/10.

I am looking forward to heading back for dinner soon."

Agricola Street Brasserie,Brasseries,"2540 Agricola Street Halifax, NS B3K 4C5 Canada",NS,44.65459,-63.5928014,4,"We ate here as a group and were seated above the kitchen in a cozy space that was large enough for our 15 or so people. We had a choice of appetizers main course and dessert. I enjoyed my calamari, it was cooked perfectly and was definitely sharable in size. I couldn’t eat more than half of it as I wanted to enjoy my main , the herbed chicken. The herbed chicken was a mixture and not the usual breast meat by itself. The accompanying veg and sauce tasted great. For dessert they hit it out of the park with cheesecake. I enjoyed my meal but would have loved it if I’d read the menu in better light. The green bean Caesar looked amazing and everyone who had it cleaned their plates. However the filet mignon were undercooked but still had great taste. The bread pudding was yummy as well."

Generous portions with reasonable prices and friendly service. Would highly recommend the lobster risotto and seafood linguine.

7 Peppers Grill,Syrian,"6169 Quinpool Road Halifax, NS B3L 4P6 Canada",NS,44.646211,-63.5953121,5,"Seven Spices, a Syrian restaurant that serves up some delicious food! I recently had the pleasure of trying their chicken shawarma and falafel wrap, and I have to say that both were absolutely fantastic.

The chicken shawarma was tender and juicy, with just the right amount of spices to give it a flavorful kick. And the falafel wrap was packed with crunchy, fresh veggies and a deliciously seasoned falafel patty that was cooked to perfection.

Overall, I highly recommend Seven Spices to anyone looking for a taste of authentic Syrian cuisine. The quality of their food is truly top-notch, and I can't wait to come back and try some of their other dishes!"

The food was so tasty and the portions were big!! The chicken skewers was so tender and juicy, the lamp kebab was so delicious! I also love the spice in the rice, very tasty!
There’s only one thing I am curious, we ordered chicken kebab plate, but it came with 2 lamb Kebab and 1 chicken skewer.
However, we do love their food so much. Will definitely gonna order it again soon!"

I know they have only this veg option, but I can visit them just for this. One suggestion,  if they add more veg option from the middle east, I would love to try more veg dishes here. The portion is also great."

Great price for tasty and plentiful food.  A gem in the heart of down town Halifax, if you want a hearty noodle soup."
Qiu Brothers Dumplings,Chinese,"1335 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1Y9 Canada",NS,44.6425069,-63.5714102,5,"In short, excellent. In long,

This restaurant is well located downtown Halifax, it's right across from Dalhousie (enginnering faculty). The parking is as such street parking.

The location itself is nice, cleanly decorated with good spacing between tables.

The menu is straightforward and easy. Simply 1 page back and forth.

We ordered the regular steamed beef and lamb dumpling with some egg rolls to start.

The eggs rolls were good crispy, but the filling was a bit unfamiliar to me but not bad.

The dumplings were simply excellent. They had a good amount of filling, the shape was also visually nice. There was a complete set of condiments, soy sauce, black vinegar, chilli oil, salt and pepper.

Service was excellent. Quick, courteous. Not sure if its a winter thing but hot water was served too, nice touch.

Prices were very fair, the steam dumpling order was many and with eggs rolls it made a great lunch.

I look forward to trying many more dumplings!

Cheers"
Qiu Brothers Dumplings,Chinese,"1335 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1Y9 Canada",NS,44.6425069,-63.5714102,4,"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but the food was ok.

Visiting Halifax from Toronto, I guess I’m putting this place up against a lot of other more established dumpling places but for what seems to be one of only a few dumpling places in town, it’s decent.

Dumplings seemed small though, and could barely taste the shrimp (pork and shrimp version). Could have ordered the pork dumplings and not have told the difference.

The chicken leg/rice combo was good - never had this dish before and the pickled potatoes or whatever it was was a nice complement. Sauce could have been more flavorful."
Qiu Brothers Dumplings,Chinese,"1335 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1Y9 Canada",NS,44.6425069,-63.5714102,5,"Had an excellent time! Server was polite and I can't rave enough about the food. I had the braised pork and egg noodles and the pork was perfectly tender. The broth it came in was very flavorful.
I don't know if it is useful quiet in the late afternoon but when we came there was only one other table of people, so it was a quiet, peaceful atmosphere.
Would definitely recommend checking this place out!"
Qiu Brothers Dumplings,Chinese,"1335 Barrington Street Halifax, NS B3J 1Y9 Canada",NS,44.6425069,-63.5714102,4,Food and service was great. A few fruit flies did keep us company which was a little annoying.
Waterfront Warehouse,Seafood,"1549 Lower Water Street Halifax, NS B3J 1S2 Canada",NS,44.6458045,-63.5702282,4,Food is decent. Calamari was lacking seasoning. Dip was above average. Apple compote ratio to fritter is to much. Ahi tuna Sandwich was amazing. The Lobster roll was great as well. Service was amazing. But Service is not great enough to overcome slightly above average food.
Waterfront Warehouse,Seafood,"1549 Lower Water Street Halifax, NS B3J 1S2 Canada",NS,44.6458045,-63.5702282,5,"Great atmosphere, food, and service.
Lobster roll had a generous serving of Lobster.
The dozen chef selection of oysters was fresh and reasonably priced.
Chicken sandwich for the non seafood lover in you was very good."

Rainy summer day, stopped for lunch and had a Lobster Roll.   The menu was built for tourists with great fare for all ages.   The Lobster Roll actually had some great quality chunks of claw and knuckle lobster meat.    The chips were also great.

Service was quick and polite.   Just what was needed for a quick lunch."

We came for a drink in the afternoon and then decided to come back for dinner after seeing how great the menu was. When we came back for dinner we got: popcorn scallops, kimchi arancini, 2 oysters then the fish/chips and the fried chicken. We loved everything! We loved that there was an oyster bar and a menu describing them all. We’ve never had them so we got one each to try. We will definitely be back!"
Verano Food Purveyors,Latin American,"1871 Hollis Street Halifax, NS B3J 3M8 Canada",NS,44.6497815,-63.5736056,5,"Lovely delicious Mexican specialties. I only wish I’d known it sooner. It’s a tidy, pleasant breakfast/lunch place. I also wish it were bigger, had a bar, and had dinner. My new favourite lunch. This will require self control not to go all the time."
Verano Food Purveyors,Latin American,"1871 Hollis Street Halifax, NS B3J 3M8 Canada",NS,44.6497815,-63.5736056,5,Stopped here on a lunchtime walk while visiting Halifax in May. I ordered two empanadas - one black bean and one pork - they were way bigger than I anticipated and I could not finish both. So tasty! Friendly staff. Would like to return to try more menu items.
Verano Food Purveyors,Latin American,"1871 Hollis Street Halifax, NS B3J 3M8 Canada",NS,44.6497815,-63.5736056,5,"I ordered Patacon.
It had roast beef ,special sauce and some other stuff. It was a Venezuelan dish.
I loved the way which they take orders. You would a qr code at the table and order by scanning it.
Customer service was awesome 👌"
Verano Food Purveyors,Latin American,"1871 Hollis Street Halifax, NS B3J 3M8 Canada",NS,44.6497815,-63.5736056,5,Favourite place for lunch in Halifax. Everything here is amazing and the service is incredible. I had the pork arepa and was not disappointed. I usually stick with a favourite menu item at restaurants but I am determined to try the entire menu as everything is phenomenal!
Verano Food Purveyors,Latin American,"1871 Hollis Street Halifax, NS B3J 3M8 Canada",NS,44.6497815,-63.5736056,5,"Verano is Halifax's top spot for homemade empanadas. Trust me. What sets them apart are two things: excellent portions and mouth watering fillings (16 Hour Braised Beef, Black Bean and Queso fresco, Chicken Tinga - just to name a few). This is a uniquely wonderful Mexican and Venezuelan restaurant experience that, from what I can tell, is family-run. Dine-in or order as the perfect grab-&-go snack, you won't be disappointed. The only downside is they're not open on weekends."
Eliot & Vine,Modern European,"2305 Clifton Street Halifax, NS B3K 4T9 Canada",NS,44.6508658,-63.5933572,5,We went early to take advantage of Happy Hour and are glad we did. It wasn’t busy so the server was very attentive. We enjoyed delicious Buck a shuck oysters from Pristine Bay and $6 margaritas to start. Then I had the tuna tartare and fries while my husband had the halibut. We were both very happy with our choices. Hope to go back soon!
Eliot & Vine,Modern European,"2305 Clifton Street Halifax, NS B3K 4T9 Canada",NS,44.6508658,-63.5933572,5,Best restaurant in town! Phenomenal food and atmosphere. Great prices for the top notch quality of their ingredients. Even the basics like the EV Caesar bring that wow factor. The house-made pasta never fails to impress! Do yourself a favour and try it out!
Eliot & Vine,Modern European,"2305 Clifton Street Halifax, NS B3K 4T9 Canada",NS,44.6508658,-63.5933572,5,"Such a wonderful happy hour (and onwards) experience! We had wonderful service all night. We enjoyed the oysters so much that we ordered a third set! Happy hour oysters is a bit funny- you get 8 oysters for one dollar each for each appetizer/main that you order. So 8$ for 8 oysters with a food purchase. There is also a sparkling, red, and white wine option for 6$ during happy hour instead of 9$. We had 24 oysters, charcuterie plate, gnocchi and a burger and it was all really delicious. I will definitely be back!"

Came for their happy hour and enjoyed $1 oysters with our order of a charcuterie board. Limited selection of wine and beer was available for $6 for happy hour.

I often find myself loving a dish at a restaurant and then reordering the same one each time I visit... however everything at EV is so delicious that I love switching it up !

Love everything about this place. Can't wait to try brunch."
The Armview Restaurant & Lounge,Diners,"7156 Chebucto Road Halifax, NS B3L 1N4 Canada",NS,44.642305,-63.619647,5,"Nice restaurant, good service. Food is tasty and reasonable prices. If you like diners or looking for a casual family/friends dinner spot, this is a great place to go. A little hard to get into narrow, small parking area (busy road - take Quinpool to rotary and turn right into lot that only has about 9 spots). Good but small wine selection and reasonable prices per bottle. Food was delicious and fresh, desserts were excellent. Recommend pies and bread pudding. Yum! My parents loved it too. Picnic tables were added outside for summer time eating, fyi."
The Armview Restaurant & Lounge,Diners,"7156 Chebucto Road Halifax, NS B3L 1N4 Canada",NS,44.642305,-63.619647,5,"Had a good dinner at the Armview. I remember as a child going into a restaurant like this with my grandmother and it brought back pleasant memories.
I love establishments like the Armview, where everything seems original to the time period it was first opened. These establishments are becoming rare to find.
The Armview is a terrific restaurant and has amazing atmosphere. The staff are super friendly and attentive to their guests. The food was good, made fresh and served hot."

There was a line of people waiting for tables, and the place was very busy. We waited 10 - 15 minutes and got a table. The server was nice, and the atmosphere was good. I didn't like the menu, and what we decided to get was OK."
The Armview Restaurant & Lounge,Diners,"7156 Chebucto Road Halifax, NS B3L 1N4 Canada",NS,44.642305,-63.619647,2,"Menu was on the small side and didn't really have a wide range. I brought my grandmother and son in to try it out. The onion rings had a too crispy coating that left the roof of my mouth a bit raw. My grandmother could not eat them. She did like the burger. I could not finish my burger as there was a short and curly not belonging to myself or my company. Thankfully the server graciously refunded the meal. The interior has a nice old set feel but, suffers from its age and lack of upkeep. My son did enjoy his pizza."

We were questioning at first when we walked in and saw that no one else was there eating whether or nor we wanted to stay but we gave it a shot and were thankful we did. This is going to be a must stop anytime were going to be in Dartmouth area.

We went a second time and tried lunch instead of brunch and it didn't disappoint."

This was my first time and I can say wholeheartedly everything was phenomenal. I was hyped about chicken waffles and it wasn't short of amazing. The chicken was tasty and bacon was crunchy! Waffles were served with maple syrup! The service was wonderful too, we were the first ones in and although few more tables came in, the server didn't neglect us. Coffee was too strong for me but it's caffeine so that's not really a bad thing lol. Free mimosa with brunch is also a score! I highly recommend this place for a good brunch meal. Just go!"

The menu has skewers, hot pot, noodles and rice dishes. Lots of options for different tastes. We tried the beef noodles and the seafood hot pot special from the Off the Eaten Path: Halifax Asian Food Festival and they were both very tasty and affordable. Would definitely come back and try other dishes. The only downside was that only one main dish came first and it wasn’t until the dish was almost finished that the other dish came."

Such a tiny hidden away spot! And soooo delicious and authentic. We shared a shrimp pan full of fresh veggies and crispy shrimp that you ate whole, skins and all. Full of fresh and dried peppers but just the right amount of heat. Interesting cumin seed flavour as well. Next time we r trying the pan full of trotters (pig feet). Wear a sweater in the summer as highly air conditioned. My only complaint is the seating is uncomfortable, no legroom at any of the tables it seems. But we keep going back because it's so delicious! Highly recommended cold chicken appetizer."

Caribbean Bliss,Caribbean,"3619 Novalea Drive Halifax, NS B3K 3G1 Canada",NS,44.6694185,-63.6086023,5,"Stumbled into Caribbean Bliss this morning and was welcomed with the warmest greeting and most fantastic food! Really low key spot in the north end and totally worth the stop. Service was so friendly as we learned the story behind the business and the passion going into the food. THIS is what real cooking tastes like. The menu is small and yet curated in a way that caters to all tastes. The flavours of Caribbean cuisine come together with French food and a touch of Lebanese background. Everything is so well done, fresh and a delicious balance of sweet with a Caribbean kick. The sweet and sassy breakfast croissant  was delicious and the Benedict was perfect! The wedges that come on the side are also amazing. Just overall a great dining experience doing something a little different in Halifax. Worth the stop! Will be back to try some of the sweet breakfast options and desserts!"

We went around eve and we got good seating options and had ordered just a little but the servings were so big 😅 keep that in mind one serving can be shared by 3 easily. And they have this halal menu wow 🥰"

I saw again Almost empty trays No  longer seafood e.t.c   Waiters looking at clients how they struggling to find something to eat and no one cares to refill trays On your request to add food in trays no one doing this"
New Panda Buffet,Buffets,"100 Main St Dartmouth, NS B2X 1R5 Canada",NS,44.6805517,-63.5417665,4,"Decent experience. All you can eat buffet which are very few in the city if Halifax. This place offers a wide range of East Asian food. The food is good. No complaints there. The service was also very good. The staff were smiling, very polite, and always checking on its customers.
I've been there approximately 4-5 times and my only criticism is that the restaurant has never been renovated. It would be nice to have the seating areas updated and cleaned as there were liquid stains on the tables and seats, peeling paint on walls and wooden seats, etc. Otherwise, you will enjoy the food and service."

The selection was excellent and the buffet counters were kept clean. Food was hot and fresh, and replenished if any selection was running low. Communication was also very good, the restaurant even called a few days in advance to reaffirm our reservation was still happening. Service was friendly and polite."

Beautiful atmosphere, non rushed services, kid friendly and able to accommodate similar but virgin drinks for you’re pre teens. Servers and service is just exceptional and just beautiful humans ❤️ I’m thankful for Robyn (sorry if I misspelled) and her amazing staff ❤️❤️ food is great I love the selection and drink selections .. I would say in the last week I have been there 3 times !! The lunch menu is just so simple and a great treat whether eating alone or with your 7yr old !!

It’s one of my favourite spots to go for a great pizza at a reasonable price.   Good spot for Family Night or Date Night.  Great variety of pizzas with some good appetizers and dessert.  My personal favourite is the Lumberjack.
Recently went for Dine Around and the special was great.
Looking forward to going back soon."

We had a party of seven and we were all served at pretty much the same time. All persons in our group had commented on the great taste of their orders. I had the Spicy Hawaiian pizza and it was phenomenal and highly recommended (not overly spicy, but you have to cater to all levels of taste). The open kitchen allows the customer(s) to view the operation and cleanliness.

Definitely we will be returning!"

The menu changed, and it was ridiculously expensive. $50 plus tip for one appetizer & one pasta .. I had only water. No wine, no desert.. no coffee .. no table bread. We shared the pasta, so each had one tube of canneloni .. walked out hungry and $60 poorer. It's not fancy enough to charge this much for a romantic dinner, yet not reasonable enough to go for a nice bite after shopping. Sorry Morris East, you're off the list."

It is ALWAYS incredibly pleasant, delicious and quick. Cody is an outstanding server… If you’re looking to have a great evening, he’s your guy. My favorite part about the restaurant is that you can tell the owners do not skimp on the quality of ingredients. Everything is always delicious - please stick around!"

I usually don't go out for Thai but I ordered the sweet and sour chicken and my boyfriend had the red curry chicken and a side of spring rolls. Food was served piping hot and in a large portion, not to mention great prices. The spring rolls were some of the best I've had. Highly recommend this place for good pricing and quality food and service, thanks again will definitely be returning in the future."

I ordered fried prawns with tamarind sauce and my friend ordered lunch menu - stir fried spicy chicken. The food was ok, an average, not too good. The service was good.
The only thing that I don’t like is the messy sauce on the edge of the plate. How long it takes to wipe it before you serve it to the customer(?!)."

We were first timers doing a private golf room.  The room itself was generous and well set up with lots of room to play and sit.  A pleasant couch and chair as well.  The food - we had some sharables and beer - was all perfectly standard for a modern pub.  The golf experience however needs help.  The simulator software being used is lacking.  We play virtual golf weekly using the E6 software and Patrons system (is poor in comparison - especially given that Patrons is more expensive.  The projection is week, the projection screen is torn up and saggy, the computer had a broken screen, the tee box does not allow you to effectively place your own tee in the ground (the white placement nub is not helpful). Service was very good. These small things could be taken care of pretty easily.  And I would strongly recommend they switch to E6 as the golf experience is much, much better."
Patrons Bar & Grill,Venues & Event Spaces,"27 Dellridge Lane Unit 105 Bedford, NS B4A 0H1 Canada",NS,44.701953,-63.687851,4,"Great visit to Patrons for lunch. This is part indoor golf driving range and part restaurant.  Overall, the service was very good, friendly and attentive.  Food quality was also good, fresh and tasty. The atmosphere is good although you will hear the wack of a golf ball as folks practice their drive. Looking around, I did notice a dead poinsettia on the floor in the corner of the restaurant, assuming it was leftover from Christmas.

One thing we all were surprised to find out and you should consider, is they do not serve any coffee there! This is the first restaurant I've visited that serves almost everything, except coffee (Note to management, put coffee on menu!).

All in all, if you are a golfer or not, Patrons is worth a visit to gather with friends for a few drinks or a bite to eat.  The driving range also looks fun."

Star removed.    Been a place I've passed my times over the years but never have gone.  Tried it out and ready liked it, just wished it was a 1/2 priced sharables.  Food was great, we ordered way too much, relaxed atmosphere and might have to try the golf sometime."

You could smell the Maple, good balance of sweet with little kick of spice, perfect. Wife had the pulled chicken club wrap with the beet salad, she almost wanted more. Great service, nice rustic atmosphere."
Station Six,Bars,"247 Herring Cove Road Halifax, NS B3P 1L6 Canada",NS,44.6201818,-63.6171113,3,"Seemed to have went downhill. I went five years ago and remember really enjoying the food. I went yesterday and it was a different story. The truffle fries tasted like they were baked in an oven (no flavour, and soggy), my friend’s smoked meat sandwich had way too much mustard, my chicken pot pie was almost tasteless (ones you can get in the frozen food aisle taste way better).

On the positive, my drink was nice and the waiter was fantastic (even though she just started working there). And the Caesar salad was good"

We loved it and will definitely be back!"
Station Six,Bars,"247 Herring Cove Road Halifax, NS B3P 1L6 Canada",NS,44.6201818,-63.6171113,3,"My husband, myself and two friends went here for dinner a couple of weeks ago. I do not recall the servers name but she came and took our order. I and my friend asked for the Captain on Duty mocktail to drink. Our drinks arrived and I had about 3 sips and started to feel off. (Now for context, I had Gastric Bypass surgery a few years back and so alcohol is a big no no and it doesn't sit well with me.. almost reacts similar to an allergy) So I felt as if I was going to pass out. I get up to go to the washroom and almost fall asleep in the bathroom. As I come back to the dining area I see my husband and friends all paying for theirs and my order. I see the receipt says that my drink was $12 so I was confused as mocktails are $5... so I go gran a drink menu and point it out to my husband that it's supposed to be $5... we bring this up to the server and she said she didn't know there was a difference. She ended up serving us Captain on Vacation which has rum in it. She also didn't ask for ID because when we ordered it was mocktails. I know she was mortified when she realized what she had done and she said the manager gave us $15 each back to compensate for what had happened... but the problem is this shouldn't have happened and what she did was dangerous. I hope she learned her lesson and won't be doing that again. I am now nervous to order mocktails again with out double checking with the server first.

Beyond that the food was awesome and we loved the vibe."

I went for the first time tonight and it lived up to every expectation I had. It's so cute inside. Twinkly lights, a little diffuser, candles... it was so nice. It was clean and the service was friendly and fast. I loved my vermicelli bowl and the veggie spring rolls were fantastic. I'm so excited I live so close! Just disappointed it took me so long to get here."

Perfectly cooked meat, top tier bread, the flavours are harmonious, and they'll add hot sauce if you ask. Nice quiet location with plenty of room to sit and a simple clean decor scheme. Very polite and attentive staff. I'll absolutely be back, I'd recommend it to anyone."

Hard to find if you don't know where you're going, but service was friendly and food was fresh. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen, and truly I found it a bit underwhelming in terms of flavour, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Not a bad option if you're in the area!"

I hadn’t had sushi since before the pandemic, and this was a real treat and the dishes were absolutely delicious!

If you wish to try Japanese cuisine there’s no better place in Halifax that I would personally recommend to a great friend."

Overall, well priced menu, delicious dishes, nice servers and naughty cooks who make fun out of customers in their native language !
Will come again and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced Japanese food in downtown Halifax.

Edit:
I'm back again and still the same good place. Thanks to Ryu

Update:
Many thanks to Chihiro and Yuki for their great service.
The eel portion was fantastic."

The raspberry lemonade float was also delicious!! They were also serving a vegan cake for their 10th birthday and I'm not really sure how they made the butter cream but it was amazing 😍."

I ordered lunch for my workplace and we loved it! I was informed that everything on the menu was vegetarian and to be honest I couldn't believe it. I got a peach plum sparkling lemonade too and it was so good! Even the meat eaters loved it. We will definitely be back. I can't wait to see what the weekly specials are!
Lemon Dogs Burgers & Lemonade,Burgers,"54 Locks Road Dartmouth, NS B2X 2W7 Canada",NS,44.7020193,-63.5535116,4,Great Imposible burgers with smart flavour combos.

Lemon Dogs Burgers & Lemonade,Burgers,"54 Locks Road Dartmouth, NS B2X 2W7 Canada",NS,44.7020193,-63.5535116,3,"Disappointed with this place. They ran out of the kind of tacos I wanted to order and then when they did arrive they were disappointingly small. I know the hype about this place is great, but I wasn't overly impressed. Service took forever. We had to wait almost 15 minutes for the drinks to arrive alone, and then another 15 for the food. It's just tacos folks. How long does it take? I won't be back. It's the only food place in Shubie Park though, so that is a bonus. Beautiful park."

The burger was tasty (although I think I let the bun get a little soggy cause I was busy chatting), fries are well seasoned and crispy, and the Dragon tail cocktail is worth trying! Great comfy seating with pillows, and they close later than other spots in the city. My friend got the fish and chips and said it was very tasty as well. Good place for quiet dinner and drinks with good company."

We both had the eggs Benedict with home fries. Everything was very good and cooked perfectly. The coffee was good as well. The service was very good too. Update: We stopped by for a quick bite and drink at happy hour. We shared an Ocean sampler and it was delicious. Nice to have other choices besides fried seafood. We be definitely going back on our next visit but not going to share this time.
Chkn Chop,Chicken Shop,"6041 North Street Halifax, NS B3K 1P1 Canada",NS,44.6541973,-63.596022,5,"Great food, with some value. I had the special while my son had the Spicy and my wife grabbed the tacos. We shared a large fry. This was my first visit, we went because my son recommended it. They have a great menu with something for everyone, if you like chicken! I hope you like chicken.  The burger is a great size with a perfect dredge and flavor topped with the perfect garnish and flavors.  The special had cheese, which I always shy away from cheese on chicken but is was excellent.  Go, eat and rave. The meal was $20 per person which is where the value is.  A phenomenal chkn burger side and drink for$20. Too easy to recommend."
Chkn Chop,Chicken Shop,"6041 North Street Halifax, NS B3K 1P1 Canada",NS,44.6541973,-63.596022,5,"I've wanted to try this place for months, but never have. Randomly decided to try it today. I got the weekly special, which was a jalapeño cheese chicken bacon sandwich, and I got fries alongside it. Came to $19 before tax, $23 after tip.

Thought for that price is better be good, it's better than good, amazing. The chicken sandwich was huge, and the fries, though looked burnt, were not. They were perfect, in texture and flavor.

Staff was friendly and the service was quick. It's expensive, but they lived up to the hype, will definitely return again someday."

Decorations and layout,  although, in my opinion, that the restaurant should be classified as fast food. The decorations is modest and nice. The space is small and can fit small groups.
That makes this place unique 👌.
Waiting to be seated,  my experience, we have to wait for 20 minutes to get seated 💺.  I understood that the space is not meant for tables serving.
Time to get the order. It was really fast. Beyond expectations.
Cleanliness,  from my experience,  the space is cleanliness is within expectations. 👌
Food, the good, was rich, delicious 😋 😍 😜 👌 and tasty 😋 😀 yamy. It is well cooked and prepared, and the food presentation was good 👍 😋.
Prices are affordable and reasonable.
Staff are friendly and respectful 🙏 🙂
Conclusion I am coming back for sure."
Chkn Chop,Chicken Shop,"6041 North Street Halifax, NS B3K 1P1 Canada",NS,44.6541973,-63.596022,4,"This is such a lovely little place. First of all, the food was excellent. Freshly made, flavourful sandwich - no frozen chicken patties here! Generous portions - next time I'll order a side to split with someone rather than a sandwich and my own side. Fairly priced for the quality of food you get, and I was really impressed with how creative the special sandwich I ordered was. This is an ""order at the counter"" kind of establishment which I didn't realize, but it was very efficient and the staff were helpful and patient while we ordered. I imagine the place would be great with a patio in the summer. The only reason I removed a star was for reasons of accessibility. The restaurant is very cramped inside and that could be a challenge for those who use a mobility aid; as well the washrooms have a very narrow door and no handlebars on the walls/reachable sink which does not accomodate for someone in a wheelchair.

I've had the 1/2 chicken and chicken sandwiches and both were excellent. I'd skip the salads, but the other sides are very tasty. Can get a bit pricey if you want sides and drink as there's not 'meal deals'. They often have specials too."

The food is absolutely amazing and our waitress was probably the best waitress we’ve ever had. We arrived around 6:15 and had our first dish (Japchae) within 20 minutes of going through the menu and ordering. They also gave us complimentary miso soup and it was excellent! We ordered the Tiger Roll to share as another appetizer and it was pretty great too. My girl had the Bibimbap and I had the Bulgogi and we were both super happy about our meals. But the best part of the whole dinner was the Bingsu, which is absolutely delicious and we will be going back often, even if it’s just for dessert! Thanks Arirang!"

We ordered a sushi set and a tofu soup. Both came pretty quickly. Although the restaurant was empty, there was a bunch of people picking up food for deliveries or take out while we were there. Food was good but not amazing. They also had the shaved ice as a dessert option which was affordable and delicious. We ordered the mango shaved ice and it came with frozen mango chunks, syrup, a scoop of mango ice cream, and blueberry cheesecake pieces. We spent $50 for two and it was a very filling meal."

We attended 2 shows there for the Jazz Fest, and we cannot believe the quality of this place. The reservation process was seamless, the service outstanding,  and the food delicious.  However the icing on the cake is the incredible music venue it is, from the sound quality to the layout of the room. We had the best time enjoying live music, and cannot wait to go back. Kudos to the whole team!"

I absolutely love the atmosphere!  The staff was so happy and accommodating, and our waiter was the sweetest.
I can’t say enough good things about this place!   The sound is amazing and it has an extremely intimate feel - even though it is quite large.   The food is sooooo great, I mean, what can I say, the menu is small and eclectic, but everything on it looks fabulous!   I had a hard time choosing, but finally decided on the crispy chicken sandwich.   It was YUM!!   I finished the night with the orange crème brûlée and a cappuccino. Had a couple of great drinks in between.  Lucky for you, I have included some photos for your viewing pleasure!  I will be back for sure. Thank you so much to the Carlton for such a great night and introduction to your wonderful establishment!"

I ordered the Donair with cheese, I think it's my favourite in Halifax/Dartmouth now. It was super good! And not crazy messy like most donairs. My favorite before I tried this was Tony's Donair.
But hungry hut prepare theirs with much more care, and it shows. That is why this is now my favorite Donair. Thank you"

The food is amazing, especially the donair pockets (my fave), but the service is really what makes this place special. My partner and I both used to come here as kids and Hana always lets us know how sweet it is that she sees us together now. Everyone is always positive, smiling and happy to see you, whether it's been a day, a week or a year you can always count on the Family of Hungry Hut to accept you and welcome you home. We love Hungry Hut, from the mozzarella sticks, roast beef subs, donairs, all the way to the pizza, garlic fingers and deep fried pepperoni, there's nothing on their menu that they don't make perfectly.

Shawarman Pizza & Subs,Donairs,"342 Windmill Road Dartmouth, NS B3A 1J1 Canada",NS,44.6798511,-63.5945919,1,"So I’m not one to usually do this , but honestly one of the worst pizzas I’ve ever had. Happened a few weeks ago ,me and my coworkers called and ordered a pizza for pick up , which we didn’t realize they closed at 1:30 and reopened at 4 or 430. We asked if we could pick up at 2 and she informed us but told us it was ok and we could come to the side door and get our pizzas. They must have made it right there and then because it was not hot at all by the time we got it. I have never opened a pizza box and laughed before. But here we are. ( we did ask for pepperoni on top but they should have informed us it is not your traditional pepperoni. ) the cheese underneath tasted sour and some of it was not even melted. We also got a Hawaiian pizza as well which the meat and cheese also tasted rancid. We were sick for days after eating this. It’s really sad to see this place go so downhill as it used to be one of the best in the area back in the day. I really hope they try and do a bit better."
Shawarman Pizza & Subs,Donairs,"342 Windmill Road Dartmouth, NS B3A 1J1 Canada",NS,44.6798511,-63.5945919,4,Hidden gem. Best donairs I've ever had (not pictured) A small is large enough to feed two people EASILY. Donair meat was spiced perfectly. I had a Chicken Caesar as well that was equally as delicious. Highly recommend if you're looking for some good eats.
Shawarman Pizza & Subs,Donairs,"342 Windmill Road Dartmouth, NS B3A 1J1 Canada",NS,44.6798511,-63.5945919,5,"Robert’s Pizza Donair & Subs makes delicious food. The first thing that I noticed when I picked up my medium donair pizza (I asked for no veggies) was how heavy it was. These pizzas have some serious weight to them. Beyond that, they are layered with meat (see the picture). The pizza comes with ample sauce on the side since the donair pizza doesn’t have tomato sauce. Dining in was comfortable, though there is no wifi. Excellent experience overall."
Shawarman Pizza & Subs,Donairs,"342 Windmill Road Dartmouth, NS B3A 1J1 Canada",NS,44.6798511,-63.5945919,5,"Gettting donairs at Roberts has been a tradition with friends for several decades (since their old location). Back home for vacation, a visit to Roberts was on the agenda. One of our friends is well acquainted with the owner, Malek, having made regular stops for donairs when living in New Brunswick, and Cambridge Bay.

We all enjoyed a tasty donair and a chat with Malek. The donairs were great, but I will need to make two visits there next time to try the pizza - they look delicious!"
Shawarman Pizza & Subs,Donairs,"342 Windmill Road Dartmouth, NS B3A 1J1 Canada",NS,44.6798511,-63.5945919,1,"I was a bite discouraged about my first ordering on Uber but glade I got it 75% off with the Uber coupon.

I order a 16” Donair Pizza.

What I liked was the pizza was huge and weighed a lot, love the big pieces of donair chunks and they weren’t shy with the cheese and donair meat👍
I loved that the donair sauce came on the side , not being on the pizza it self, made the pizza easy to cut without it being sloppy, love the idea.
👌🏼🫶

What I didn’t like was there a inch and a half of the donair meat not covered by cheese making it very dry.
Looking at the pizza wen first opened cheese topping could of been a bite more cooked and spread out more to the sides of the pizza as there was about a inch and a half of donair meat not covered making it very dry and could of added a bite more tomato’s on top.
For the crust, pizza was over cooked on the bottom and had to cut with a streak knife it was very hard to go true crust but inside of pizza crust wasn’t cooked and looked like Raw dough."
El Chino Snack Bar,Mexican,"2398 Robie St Halifax, NS B3K Canada",NS,44.6510488,-63.5927594,4,"Cute spot, cute ambiance, great fish tacos and margaritas (I have no experience with margaritas but I liked it)

First off, fish tacos were so good! Fish was perfectly fried in a crispy batter with great toppings.
Pork taco was loaded but lacked a wow factor (looked good and was filling and juicy though)
Chicken wings were dry/overcooked and the flavour wasn’t great (reminded me of a cold Chinese fried fish dish-also might be a me thing but I wouldn’t get it again)
Nachos were yummy but basic so I felt like the price was a bit high. Chips were very fresh and crunchy.
Pork belly bao was yummy but lacked a fresh flavour like cilantro or pickled veg (might be a personal preference) but the pork belly was yummy and the bao was fantastic.

We ordered the classic margarita and I thought it was great (I usually hate tequila but I’m trying to open up and try it again) and the agua de Jamaica wasn’t my jam but that might be a me thing.

Female Asian server was great! So nice and helpful BUT there was the grumpiest looking white female server that… might be in the wrong profession. I felt intimidated whenever she glanced at our table. She brought out our nachos and practically rolled her eyes while adding another table to ours (I told her to leave nachos on the bench (table was full) beside me no biggie). Just big frowns the whole time we were there.

Overall pretty good experience, kinda pricy ($135 for 2 people) but will be back for more delicious fish tacos and margaritas."
El Chino Snack Bar,Mexican,"2398 Robie St Halifax, NS B3K Canada",NS,44.6510488,-63.5927594,5,"I loved the atmosphere and how delicious everything was. It's a small venue with limited seating allowing the staff and kitchen to focus on quality food and service. I also loved how the menu was short; you knew that whatever you ordered would be delicious. The food did not disappoint, the nachos and the tacos were so tasty and generous portions! I'll be back and next time to try their bao ice cream sandwich :)"

We wanted a mixology themed event and K and her team really delivered. They organized a super fun, informative & delicious evening. They were incredibly friendly and helped us through all the steps of crafting our own cocktails. They went above and beyond by decorating the space and crafting personalized cocktails. We also tried some of their snacks which were very tasty and generous. Can’t recommend them enough! Perfect space for a small event or just an evening out with loved ones!"

El Chino Snack Bar,Mexican,"2398 Robie St Halifax, NS B3K Canada",NS,44.6510488,-63.5927594,4,"Really enjoyed my first experience here at El Chino. A friend recommended it because of the tacos and we were excited to try it. We had the pork dumplings, General Tao chicken wings, and the pork tacos. Everything was delicious. The standout item was definitely the tacos. They were jam packed and very authentic Mexican tasting. It’s definitely a little bit pricey for what you get, which is the only reason I didn’t give it a full 5 stars. However, they do call them self a snack bar so it’s not exactly a dinner destination so I may do it right next time and just pop in here when I crave a little snack rather than a full meal."

If we could rare it more than 5 stars, we would. We got the gnocchi appetizer, a soba, a ramen and a rice bowl and every single dish was generous, flavourful, and beautiful.

Everything was delicious, portions were huge. I couldn't finish my Ramen and have enough left over for an entire other meal.

This was the best Ramen we've ever had, fresh, flavorful, ready quick, excellent broth, and the service was perfection. 10/10 would recommend!"

I chose the dinner special with soup and salad which were both very good.  The sushi plate had California roll, spicy tuna, assorted sushi and sashimi.  The platter was good but sashimi was cut a bit too thick.  I have eaten a lot of sushi and sushi Nami was just okay."
Sushi Nami Royale,Japanese,"149 Hector Gate Dartmouth, NS B3B 0E5 Canada",NS,44.7052262,-63.5626061,5,Had our lunch. They open 12nn every Sunday. We came early around 11 am.

Sushi Nami Royale,Japanese,"1458 Queen Street Suite 102 Halifax, NS B3J 2H7 Canada",NS,44.6423127,-63.5760024,5,"This is a pretty decent sushi restaurant, middling food but not terrible. They have a wide variety of options if you want to explore some new flavors.

The interior design and atmosphere is probably the best part about this place - a wide sushi bar takes up the middle of the space, and the entire restaurant is slightly sunken into the building which makes it feel a little quieter despite being right downtown.

They have a pretty nice variety of beverages, including an interesting ramune flavored drink which I would recommend if it's still available."
Sushi Nami Royale,Japanese,"1458 Queen Street Suite 102 Halifax, NS B3J 2H7 Canada",NS,44.6423127,-63.5760024,3,"Went to get sushi downtown for a lunch date with a friend. I ordered the Maki Lunch, providing me with a delicious plate full of rolls. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very nice with kind servers to bring you your food. The miso soup was excellent and the spicy salmon rolls were very yummy. However, the house salad was not very good and some of the rolls had an uneven proportion of elements, making each bite slightly unbalanced. Overall, a good place to go for a reasonably priced sushi lunch deal."
Sushi Nami Royale,Japanese,"1458 Queen Street Suite 102 Halifax, NS B3J 2H7 Canada",NS,44.6423127,-63.5760024,5,"Great, fresh sushi. The quality of the food makes up for any other shortcomings. I was there on a holiday weekend (Canada Day) and it was clear they were not prepared to be that busy. The staff was struggling to keep up. But once I finally got my food, it was amazing. Would definitely recommend to anyone."
Sushi Nami Royale,Japanese,"1458 Queen Street Suite 102 Halifax, NS B3J 2H7 Canada",NS,44.6423127,-63.5760024,4,"The sashimi is a must: big chunks of melt-in-your-mouth salmon, tuna & escolar. This Cantonese-owned place has been a Halifax classic and I was happy to know they’re still open. This newer location has great decor and is very spacious! Waitress was very polite.

Rolls were somewhat of a letdown on the day we went, but tasted good. They are a bit loose, sparse and some classics like the dragon roll, while not bad here, didn’t taste as good as some other restaurants."

Piatto Pizzeria + Enoteca,Pizza,"5144 Morris Street Halifax, NS B3J 1T6 Canada",NS,44.6418513,-63.5695988,5,"I love the wood fire oven pizza from this establishment.  The beet salad is equally amazing.  The burger week burger was also tasty  in 2022.  I eat here regularly and have never had a bad experience.  Great place to pull up a seat at the bar solo for a drink and apertivo or to go on a date night with your partner. Atmospheric and the staff are over the top friendly.  Cannot suggest this place enough.
Edit1: Burger week burger is insane, best I had all week. 2023. Edit 2: Now owned and operated by new management as of 2023_07_07. Still the same vibes for now but with more creative freedom over the food I would think. Down the road the place will be redone inside for a new and refreshing feel.  Can't wait.  --Sincerely longtime supporter."

We've photographed here multiple times and it's always been an absolute treat! The decor is really rustic, super into the wooden slats and dope spot for dancing. It's also right in the historic properties on the waterfront which is perfect for portraits, and super beautiful! It is a dark venue but as long as you hire photographers who know how to shoot there, you are golden. 10/10 recommend!"

We went for supper and a beer but ended up staying until last call. The band that playing that night was excellent and once the place got busy we just ended up staying. Despite the place being extremely full the staff was attentive.

I would not recommend this place to anyone who gets claustrophobic as once the band starts playing it is very hard to move. We were there on a Wednesday evening and it was a busy as a Friday night.

Otherwise we had a great Night and of course I highly recommend the lower deck for a true maritime experience"

When giving the rating I separate it's rating category in comparison to going to a fine dining experience. So far I have had the items from a Dinner for 2 plus meat spring rolls.  Nothing short of being blown away, every item was cooked as close to perfection you can get. Each item deserves a thorough review as they all genuinely surprised me but I shall not for both our sake: flavour, consistency, portions, and a truly harmonious balance of grease/oil/moisture in each item. I have not had a bad experience, I won't ever care even if I do. This establishment has both earned my respect and culinary appreciation. Please don't order from them on a food app. It's worth the effort."

55+ menu only $9.99. in most cases the same size as 55-, but cheeper!
Receipt attached. Regular menu prices quite reasonable. Very cool hash browns! Multi grain toast.
*Nice clean bathrooms."
IHOP,Breakfast & Brunch,"80 Hogan Court Bedford, NS B4B 2H1 Canada",NS,44.696387,-63.6905807,5,"Very friendly staff. Wasn't busy at all. Omelets are very good and a large portion. Had to take home half. Was a bit disappointed,  there was eggs Benedict advertised but it wasn't available until tomorrow. I would think something shouldn't be advertised if you can't get it. Overall a good place to have an enjoyable meal."
IHOP,Breakfast & Brunch,"80 Hogan Court Bedford, NS B4B 2H1 Canada",NS,44.696387,-63.6905807,2,"I am seriously disappointed at the ihop here in Bedford. I have eaten at ihops in the united states and absolutely loved it. The Nova Scotia Version is a disappointment. I just ordered the cinn-a-stacks and only have cinnamon on the top, not in between the stacks. The cream cheese drizzle was lacking as well."
IHOP,Breakfast & Brunch,"80 Hogan Court Bedford, NS B4B 2H1 Canada",NS,44.696387,-63.6905807,5,"Delicious food, but often a bit of a wait. However, I discovered that you can order take out, so for Mother’s Day we did just that! Called about 40 minutes ahead of time, and staff was very helpful to get our order right. Take out bags had everything we needed to enjoy a perfect breakfast at home :)"

Nayya Restaurant,Mediterranean,"540 Southgate Drive Bedford, NS B4A 0E1 Canada",NS,44.7016886,-63.6775843,5,"I definitely recommend Nayya to every pizza lover. They probably have the biggest pizza collection in the entire NS. I have never seen this much variety anywhere else! Amazing and very exciting! Quality of the food was superb! Taste was fantastic and very balanced.
Staff are super super friendly and I really liked their behaviour. Specially Mr. Amin whose behaviour and customer care discipline should be a role model to many famous restaurants in Halifax. Such a down to earth and nice person!
I am so happy to have found this place! It’s a game changer for me :)"
Nayya Restaurant,Mediterranean,"540 Southgate Drive Bedford, NS B4A 0E1 Canada",NS,44.7016886,-63.6775843,5,"One of the best place to have variety of pizzas, subs and many more. Customer service is really good. Especially Mr. Amin (Sanjam) is a really good person who always has a smile on his face. All crew members were really nice they did their best.

3 Cheese Garlic fingers and Margherita pizza highly recommended.

We live just around the corner and often get pizza from other places in the area but thought we'd try this new place. We were not disappointed!!  It arrived quickly and was hot, fresh and really delicious. LOADS of FRESH toppings! The taste is so amazing and perfect. Everyone raved about how tasty the sauce is  and how generous the toppings were. This is now our go-to pizza place! Best pizza in the area! And best price in the area!"
Nayya Restaurant,Mediterranean,"540 Southgate Drive Bedford, NS B4A 0E1 Canada",NS,44.7016886,-63.6775843,5,"PUT THIS ON YOUR BUCKET LIST. Well worth the hour travel.

Wow I was super impressed at this recommendation from my friend. I ordered the gourmet donair with garlic fingers combo and it did not disappoint. Carved tastefully spiced donair meat right off the stick and the ingredients where to die for. The garlic fingers were on point and soo good.

The wife ordered the shawarma platter not realizing how huge it was and absolutely loved it. I took a few bites of it as well and it was tasty.

The child ordered the fish and chips but she thoroughly enjoyed them.

Price point is on the higher side but you are getting a LOT of food. Pretty sure we could split the shawarma or the donair pizza between the three of us.

My only complaint was the dine in experience could have been made better minus the timers constantly chiming in the background. Otherwise zero complaints for us."
Esquire Restaurant,American (Traditional),"772 Bedford Hwy Bedford, NS B4A 1A2 Canada",NS,44.7079235,-63.6665179,2,"Very professional staff, their mussels dish is very good, after that their lobster sandwich is good, but it is totally unacceptable that their calamari dish is calamari taken directly from a deep-frozen bag and the same goes for their French fries, even with their vegetables, which are all taken from frozen bags. For a restaurant in Halifax where you're not looking for fast food, they serve calamari that I can enjoy at home just by taking it out of a bag and frying it. Forget frozen food, increase price of your dishes and your gonna be the king of your area with happy customer and same profits."
Esquire Restaurant,American (Traditional),"772 Bedford Hwy Bedford, NS B4A 1A2 Canada",NS,44.7079235,-63.6665179,5,This is a cozy restaurant along the bedford coast. I go there very often since it's close to my work place. I am curious to know why mostly elders eat there! It's normally full at peak time. The food is not too bad and reasonably priced. I like the coffee which is refilled. My friend Cyntia absolutely love the coconut pie cake.

Esquire Restaurant,American (Traditional),"772 Bedford Hwy Bedford, NS B4A 1A2 Canada",NS,44.7079235,-63.6665179,5,"Excellent food and service. Coming from a landlocked city, I forgot that seafood was supposed to taste like this.  We had the seafood chowder and fish&chips.  The shellfish felt like butter in my mouth and the dish flaked easily but still moist.  The chowder was not thick but rather like a cream soup.  The fish and chips was light and not oily.

Service was very friendly and attentive. Had the feel of a seafood dinner with its relaxed local atmosphere.

Price point is decent for the quality of the food.  The presentation is what you expect for a diner but the flavour is far above."
Wasabi House,Japanese,"6403 Quinpool Road Halifax, NS B3L 1A7 Canada",NS,44.644649,-63.6005585,5,"We were in the area and looking at dine in options. I found this restaurant and was sold by reviews immediately. I knew I had to try it. Not sure how you can spend there $10-20 per person. You eithereat like a bird or don't like rolls. We ordered bento box, udon, couple rolls and ice-cream with bananas. I wouldn't call it ""a lot"" of food per person, our bill was a little over $60 per 2 people.
The food was very fresh and delicious! Complementary rolls were also VERY good. I wouldn't think of ordering them myself, but the combinations of ingredients make them so yummy, I will order them next time.
I would definitely recommend the place!"

Wasabi House,Japanese,"6403 Quinpool Road Halifax, NS B3L 1A7 Canada",NS,44.644649,-63.6005585,5,"They stopped dine-in since the pandemic started, heard they resumed dine-in recently and decided to go for lunch.  The sushi tastes the same as before, the food is fresh and the service is as good as ever.  The two of us ordered three rolls and tempura shrimp. The boss gave us a large plate of sushi for free. In the end, we paid less than $35 and took a large box home.  I will be back again."
Wasabi House,Japanese,"6403 Quinpool Road Halifax, NS B3L 1A7 Canada",NS,44.644649,-63.6005585,5,"If you see other reviewers saying that they get free rolls... they're right! I ordered 2 rolls and they gave me 2 extra rolls on the house.

This makes Wasabi House a truly reasonably-priced restaurant—perhaps the best one in Halifax!"

Paulo & Suzanne,Diners,"5501 Boulevard Gouin O Montreal, QC H4J 1C8 Canada",QC,45.5338649,-73.717242,5,"We came here specifically for poutine and was not disappointed!

We ordered a traditional poutine and popcorn chicken poutine. The gravy was good and not too salty, the popcorn chicken was still crispy and the squeaky cheese was perfect.

They have so many different options for poutine that I would need to come back.

The restaurant is a small local vibe and is 24/7. Just a heads up, they only accept cash!"
Paulo & Suzanne,Diners,"5501 Boulevard Gouin O Montreal, QC H4J 1C8 Canada",QC,45.5338649,-73.717242,5,"My favourite food place ever🔥 the best Poutine in Montreal, also restaurant working until late. Recommend everyone to visit! Especially try their pancakes with chocolate and strawberries for dessert 😍😍😍"
Paulo & Suzanne,Diners,"5501 Boulevard Gouin O Montreal, QC H4J 1C8 Canada",QC,45.5338649,-73.717242,3,"I personally don’t understand the hype of this place. I had the BBQ poutine and the Poulet Extreme Grilled Cheese. The grilled cheese was good but the poutine was horrible. The gravy was good, not too salty and there were a lot of cheese curds. However, the fries were not good. I feel as though they were fried in old bad oil. I don’t understand how people can say this is the best poutine in Montreal. I was extremely disappointed. The service was not great. The waitress messed up the order. Maybe it’s because she was new but it didn’t make my experience enjoyable."
Paulo & Suzanne,Diners,"5501 Boulevard Gouin O Montreal, QC H4J 1C8 Canada",QC,45.5338649,-73.717242,5,"Cash only place,they have a withdrawal machine but the machine doesn't always have cash in it.

Best comfort food I've had in MTL
The food is always on point whether you pick it up or on Uber eats

They put the perfect portion of cheese curds and gravy on the poutine.

Fell in love with the smoked meat grilled cheese

The burgers are all so good, always having trouble deciding which one to get.

The staff has always been super nice.

Definitely the place to go to satisfy your comfort food cravings

They have a small seating area which is always packed, this place is mostly packed during night time also.

They do breakfast, lunch, dinner, late snack.
I also love there thin crepes with strawberry and bananas.

I'm obsessed with this place."
Paulo & Suzanne,Diners,"5501 Boulevard Gouin O Montreal, QC H4J 1C8 Canada",QC,45.5338649,-73.717242,4,"Great food in general, a table could hold up to 5-6 people maximum. Would recommend for small group of friends for a night out. Could be a little busy at night because it is one of few places opened at that time."
Kazu,Japanese,"1844 Rue Sainte-Catherine O Montreal, QC H3H 1M1 Canada",QC,45.493037,-73.579836,5,"Despite my name - I am actually Japanese and for the first time since moving here I felt like I was eating real Japanese food. We ordered the bone marrow  yakitori, forty eight hour pork w/ curry and deep fried beans - all of which were excellent. With that said, as is usually the case with small plate restaurants, the dish you least expect ends up being the highlight of the meal. Today, the green beans were no exception to this rule. The combination of rich truffle mayo and salty and crunchy beans was perfect.

I was also surprised to find actual vegetable chunks in the curry. Personally, I prefer when restaurant opt to make a more homestyle sauce instead of blending it smooth.

Overall, a fantastic meal. Will definitely be bringing my Japanese mother here."
Kazu,Japanese,"1844 Rue Sainte-Catherine O Montreal, QC H3H 1M1 Canada",QC,45.493037,-73.579836,4,"We had a group of six and it took us more than 1.5 hours to get a seat on a Saturday night. That being said the food was good but the drinks are desserts were the highlight for me. Yuzu beer and ginger beer was amazing. The black tea soft serve ice cream was the best part!!! Get the homemade ice cream for sure. Food wise it was a little over hyped: I read the reviews on google and a lot of people recommended the tuna salmon bowl so I ordered it. It was good but wasn’t fully worth the hype, it felt like it had more salad in it that salmon, instead I would recommend ordering the 48 hr pork or lamb. The fried beans for appetizer was good and came in a large portion."
Kazu,Japanese,"1844 Rue Sainte-Catherine O Montreal, QC H3H 1M1 Canada",QC,45.493037,-73.579836,5,"A must go to restaurant!!! They are the nicest people ever! They are super understanding when it comes to allergies. And the food is so flavorful and feels like you’re in Japan. You feel like you’re at home. I came here from the United States, and I would honestly fly back to Canada just to come back and eat here again. We came in 30 minutes before they closed and they were still were kind and sweet! We’re sorry we came here late, but thank you so much for the amazing service and food."
Kazu,Japanese,"1844 Rue Sainte-Catherine O Montreal, QC H3H 1M1 Canada",QC,45.493037,-73.579836,5,"There is a reason that there’s always a lineup in front of this restaurant ! It’s simply the best one in town! So flavourful and mouthwatering! We enjoy every single dishes! I especially love the beef carpaccio, the sashimis and the shrimp burgers. The wait is about 45 minutes depending on what time you arrive. They make their own soft ice cream which is extremely delicious!"
Kazu,Japanese,"1844 Rue Sainte-Catherine O Montreal, QC H3H 1M1 Canada",QC,45.493037,-73.579836,5,"Always a line-up.

Damas,Syrian,"1201 Avenue Van Horne Montreal, QC H2V 1K4 Canada",QC,45.5225641,-73.6132118,5,"Damas is my newest favorite restaurant. Everything was to perfection. The food is incredible. From the texture of the hummus, to the grilled veggies. It’s the tastiest food! It was so good and very good portions.

My only issue is that this seems like a restaurant worth going to with a few people to split and share the food. It is an EXPENSIVE place, and my wife and I ordered too much food for 2 people. Go with friends."

it’s pricy so it’s not to be repeated every other week :) … but the ambiance is very nice , the music in the background , the excellent service and exquisite menu …. The place is always packed but you never feel rushed to eat and you don’t feel waitresses are stress and running around … every thing is organized and chill …
One tiny note , I used to like the hotly served bread better in the past …. Again excellent experience"
Damas,Syrian,"1201 Avenue Van Horne Montreal, QC H2V 1K4 Canada",QC,45.5225641,-73.6132118,4,We took the tasting menu with wine pairing (exceptional wine). Honestly it was expensive and I was expecting that. The wine pairing were awesome. The food itself for the most part was amazing and really tasteful except for the desert.  I must admit though I was still hungry after a 400$ bill which is a bit disappointing no matter how good the food was.
Bottega,Pizza,"2059 Boulevard Saint-Martin Ouest Laval, QC H7S 1N3 Canada",QC,45.5647977,-73.7345801,4,"We’ve been the Montreal branch, found it better than Laval. Service is only okay, I mean from
the welcoming to the availability of our table sharp at the time of reservation.. food is always very good in both branches, order from what they have on the special menu for the night, often you will be satisfied and its always good to twist the menu and add new things. No problem for the prices very reasonable for this very high quality of pizza."

I got a chance to eat more than just the pizza (which is always delicious), but a good amount of many other dishes and it was all phenomenal.

I recommended literally a lot of things on the menu especially the lamp piece which is 10/10 juicy🥵
The portions are decently sized to really enjoy a appetizer, main dish and desert for a good fair price for the quality you are recieving.

Located in one of the most touristic places of the city Montreal. Enjoyed the draft beer and salad czars before our pizza. Guys! You are perfect. My wife and I enjoyed our Friday evening there and was there the next day for Saturday lunch🙂🍻. Can't wait for the weekend to go there again...
Il Focolaio,Pizza,"1223 Rue du Square-Phillips Montreal, QC H3B 3E9 Canada",QC,45.5040151,-73.5681774,4,I was amazed by how large the menu was and how many options were available just on pizza. Our waiter was well-seasoned and his recommendations were exactly what we needed. This restaurant was founded in the early 1980s and I found the taste of the pizzas nostalgic. Here is a must-try spot if you are a pizza lover like me!
Il Focolaio,Pizza,"1223 Rue du Square-Phillips Montreal, QC H3B 3E9 Canada",QC,45.5040151,-73.5681774,5,"Freshly made pizza and really fantastic. There is lot of choices you can select. Last but not the least, the tiramisu was so good that I highly recommended."

And this was my mistake. I'm crazy about pizza, so going to a restaurant with 77 types of pizzas = going to heaven!! The service is very fast, my order was ready in 7 minutes.
By the way, there is a beautiful view of the park and skyscrapers from here."
Joe Beef,Seafood,"2491 Rue Notre-Dame Ouest Montreal, QC H3J 1N6 Canada",QC,45.483069,-73.5752691,5,"This was one for the record books. A flight over to Canada, a booking made in advanced, a ‘clear my schedule’ kind of evening.

From the moment you set foot in Joe Beef you know you’re in for a what can only be described as romantically gluttonous time.

We started with the seafood platter, scallops the size of my fist with an added lobster tails (for good measure). Moving onto the Octopus Bouillabaisse, Sweetbreads, Duck and Hanger Steak. All with their own amazing sauces that seemed to almost glue the dish together with richness.

The staff were welcoming and made us feel right at ease in our quest to tackle the menu. Throughout each dish we were almost confused where to start and end as each bite was just better than the last.

A full but non-intimidating wine list let us make the best of our food settling on a lovely Riesling.

Did we travel to Canada just for Joe Beef? No. But would it have been worth it if it was the only place we visited? Yes."
Joe Beef,Seafood,"2491 Rue Notre-Dame Ouest Montreal, QC H3J 1N6 Canada",QC,45.483069,-73.5752691,5,"We were a party of 3 and loved everything that Joe Beef offered. We had high expectations and it exceeded it. Flo made our experience even better with all his recommendations. They are known for their Lobster Pasta but honestly, just ask what’s good. They are the professionals after all. All the staff were lovely and so courteous! Thank you so much for the experience."
Joe Beef,Seafood,"2491 Rue Notre-Dame Ouest Montreal, QC H3J 1N6 Canada",QC,45.483069,-73.5752691,4,"I will be honest, I can see why some people will say that it is the best restaurant in town.
However it is just not for me.

-I have seen better french cuisine restaurant with a larger menu and product that are just as fresh and local. Even if its about the same price, I would still prefer the one with larger menu.

-The waiting time is quite dreadful, I understand that it is a smaller sized restaurant, but waiting for an hour and 15 minutes isn't exactly ideal for the food quality received. Food was, okay. (Fries were extremely salty)

-Have to give credits to the waiters for refilling our cup every 10 minutes so the service is really up on another level.

-The booking has to be made too much in advance in order to guarantee a spot. This is due to the fact that the restaurant is very small and has a very large title under it's belt.

Maybe the place is really the most astonishing place to visit, or maybe my brokeneess has limited my vision towards fancy restaurant and made me unable to understand the reaction by most people. But I would say that it is definitely a restaurant that you would go for once or twice in a lifetime. Not more unfortunately."
Joe Beef,Seafood,"2491 Rue Notre-Dame Ouest Montreal, QC H3J 1N6 Canada",QC,45.483069,-73.5752691,5,"Joe Beef was one of the many reasons we first visited Montreal. The food here meets and some cases exceeds expectations. The drinks are also very well made. The perfect martini is a great way to start the meal, along with some oysters and one of the specials as an appetizer. The lobster pasta was insanely good, along with the special of short rib that we got this time around. The desserts are also so so good. Hits the mark all around, great place and will definitely go again!"
Joe Beef,Seafood,"2491 Rue Notre-Dame Ouest Montreal, QC H3J 1N6 Canada",QC,45.483069,-73.5752691,5,"This was a fantastic experience!

The portions are generous, but the dumplings are my biggest disappointment. The skin of the dumplings were too thick and the meat had no flavor. I could not distinguish which one was beef, lamb or pork."
Restaurant Yi Pin Xiang,Chinese,"735 boul Décarie Saint-Laurent, QC H4L 3L3 Canada",QC,45.5111798,-73.6774754,3,"Decent Sunday evening dining experience.

Service was fast and took the shrimp dumpling and the chicken general Tao. The Chicken general tao was actually pretty good ! Love the crisp of it and portion was alright.

As for the dumpling was little disappointed for the price. The texture was little harder to chew than the usual ones but overall it's alright my experience ! Will probably come again to try their others stuff on the menu"
Restaurant Yi Pin Xiang,Chinese,"735 boul Décarie Saint-Laurent, QC H4L 3L3 Canada",QC,45.5111798,-73.6774754,5,"I ordered from this restaurant since I was with friends and we wanted to eat dumplings. We ordered 4 types of dumplings.
They gave us a good recommendation of which one should be fried and which one should be steamed. It was pretty on point.
Also, for the price payed, it was pretty good quality and quantity. I definitely would recommend this restaurant for dumplings. It will be my go to place from now on."
Restaurant Yi Pin Xiang,Chinese,"735 boul Décarie Saint-Laurent, QC H4L 3L3 Canada",QC,45.5111798,-73.6774754,5,Absolutely amazing dumplings. Great quantity and fair price! Peanut butter sauce is delicious as well!
Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ,Japanese,"1255 Rue Crescent Montreal, QC H3G 2B1 Canada",QC,45.4969703,-73.5750572,5,"I could talk about this place for hours!! FIRST of all, great music. I announced that I loved a song they were playing probably around 5 times. SECOND of all, everything was so so accessible for my allergies, which is rare for an asian restaurant. (gluten sensitivity) Their meats are marinated in gluten free sauces so I was able to enjoy my meal with my family without concerns of cross contamination. FINALLY, the service was amazing. The server was so incredibly kind and helpful with my allergies and knew the menu front to back. She provided helpful advice on how much food we should order, and reminded us on the allergens for every dish she brought out. Overall, I would definitely recommend and I will be visiting soon in my area."
Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ,Japanese,"1255 Rue Crescent Montreal, QC H3G 2B1 Canada",QC,45.4969703,-73.5750572,5,"First time trying this place, beyond my expectation.

The ambiance is great, music, lots of happy customers enjoying their food.

Our two waitresses back to back, very friendly and efficient. always made sure we had everything. Explained to us every dish they would bring to our table.

Food wise, the meat and seafood were quite fresh and tasty, except for the kimchi (not the usual korean kimchi, it was overall too sweet and not spicy)

Price is definitely not cheap for those with budget but definitely worth going. Very nice experience definitely will go back!"
Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ,Japanese,"1255 Rue Crescent Montreal, QC H3G 2B1 Canada",QC,45.4969703,-73.5750572,4,"I have been to Gyu-Kaku a few times and I would easily recommend this over Korean BBQs around. There’s a lot to choose from and it’s always too much meat for me, even when I went for lunch and had two meats lunch course. But the ambiance is amazing, not a big fan of cooking my own food (I’d rather get salmonella from the chef’s cooking than my own), but they change the grill frequently so that’s one good thing. The garlic fried rice is delicious and the basic meats are great. Overall I definitely recommend this place. 4 stars because I am not a big fan of the whole grilling your own meat concept."
Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ,Japanese,"1255 Rue Crescent Montreal, QC H3G 2B1 Canada",QC,45.4969703,-73.5750572,5,"Be sure to call beforehand as they are always fully booked!

This is my best friend and I's go-to place.
They have a lot of food choices. Very good variety and very good quality meat and marinades. They also have good tasting desserts. Beware: It is NOT an all you can eat if that's what you are looking for.

We've been eating here a lot, and each time, I have forgotten to take photos before we completely demolish them. Here's a photo of the desserts, though."
Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ,Japanese,"1255 Rue Crescent Montreal, QC H3G 2B1 Canada",QC,45.4969703,-73.5750572,5,"Love it! The quality food is impeccable. Alot of meat options for groups or individuals. Services a little slow but normal because they get full house easily so you better reserve your spot in advance and also it is NOT an ""all you can eat"" you have to pay by pieces so get your wallet ready if you are planning eating without minding cost because it's abit pricey but worth it!
PS: if you can't finish your cooked food you can ask for a transport box to bring it home :)"
KINTON RAMEN,Ramen,"2575 Boulevard Daniel-Johnson Laval, QC H7T 1S8 Canada",QC,45.5696632,-73.7570161,5,"Hands down the best vegé ramens available. Everything from the broth to the noodles was great. Their rice noodles have great texture and doesn't get soft and pasty like other places. But that spicy miso broth was the star of the night. In the future I hope they add spicy tofu and fried potatoes on the menu; those would be delicious in ramen. Great food, great atmosphere."
KINTON RAMEN,Ramen,"2575 Boulevard Daniel-Johnson Laval, QC H7T 1S8 Canada",QC,45.5696632,-73.7570161,4,Food is great as always but service was really slow. The beef donburi is pretty good. The Pork Tonkotsu Ramen is a classic!
KINTON RAMEN,Ramen,"2575 Boulevard Daniel-Johnson Laval, QC H7T 1S8 Canada",QC,45.5696632,-73.7570161,3,"The food is good and especially delicious during winter. We liked the beef ramen but personally, we liked the pork better.

What was a bit annoying was the waiting time. We first had to wait 20 minutes for a table (which you had to install Yelp...) And then another 40 minutes for two bowls of ramen. And our order got mixed up.

So good food, but the service and waiting time was what brought the rating down."
KINTON RAMEN,Ramen,"2575 Boulevard Daniel-Johnson Laval, QC H7T 1S8 Canada",QC,45.5696632,-73.7570161,3,"I went to Kinton Ramen with my boyfriend for dinner and it was packed! The staff was friendly overall. I ordered the Pork Shoyu and my boyfriend ordered the Pork Miso. Unfortunately, the shoyu lacked flavor compared to the miso, but the miso itself wasn't exceptional either. While the portion sizes were good for the price, we were disappointed with the taste of both ramens."
KINTON RAMEN,Ramen,"2575 Boulevard Daniel-Johnson Laval, QC H7T 1S8 Canada",QC,45.5696632,-73.7570161,4,good ramen at a good price! Servers were friendly! Would come here again. I got the original pork ramen. Good but a little bland for my liking and the pork was tougher than I would’ve liked
Phnom Penh,Vietnamese,"7153 Chemin de la Côte-des-Neiges Montreal, QC H3R 2M2 Canada",QC,45.5053098,-73.6416323,4,"Good little restaurant. I had the dry Phnom Penh soup, egg rolls, fried Chinese doughnuts and an avocado smoothie.
Even though the restaurant was full, the wait was not too long, about 10min. Service was quite quick. The soup was tasty. The egg rolls were amazing. The fried doughnuts were crispy. Great little meal. Just don’t forget to bring your cash because it is cash only."
Phnom Penh,Vietnamese,"7153 Chemin de la Côte-des-Neiges Montreal, QC H3R 2M2 Canada",QC,45.5053098,-73.6416323,4,"Food is great and staff is nice. I had a Phnom Penh with soup on the side. You can have the option of choosing rice noodle, wheat noodle or both together.

Not the best localisation though and not much place to seat. It's toddler friendly (baby seats).
Parking hard to find.

Overall, it was worth my 30 mins drive and 5 mins time of searching for a parking 😅."
Phnom Penh,Vietnamese,"7153 Chemin de la Côte-des-Neiges Montreal, QC H3R 2M2 Canada",QC,45.5053098,-73.6416323,5,Authentic food. I liked it very much. I’ve never tried Cambodian food before but I found it super good. Highly recommend.

KINKA IZAKAYA MONTREAL,Japanese,"1624 Rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest Montreal, QC H3H 2S7 Canada",QC,45.4893389,-73.584505,2,"I personally had a mediocre experience. We were sat at the worst table that was wobbly and next to a large group of loud people even though I had made a reservation prior. Other tables were available and I do realize I should have asked for a different table. The drinks are really good but do not order the set menu. It’s boring and repetitive. Not any of the dishes had a wow factor and for a table d‘hôte you would expect the dishes to be better curated. I still think some of the other dishes might be delicious though. On another hand, the decor is very charming and the bathrooms are top tier. Visit the bathroom just for the experience you won’t regret it. Note that the music is very loud and it’s hard to hear each other talk. One thing that really bothered me though is the poor service. The dishes were served not in order, it took them very long to pick up empty plates and overall they looked like they did not want to be there. Léa was the only one that should be a server since she at least had the ability to smile and check on us a couple of times."
KINKA IZAKAYA MONTREAL,Japanese,"1624 Rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest Montreal, QC H3H 2S7 Canada",QC,45.4893389,-73.584505,5,"The atmosphere here is clean, open, and casual. The service we were provided with was also top and one of the best. Everyone was so nice and the food was so good! I honestly recommend their cocktails too - I had the mojito lychee and it was the most refreshing cocktails ever. I wish I could try all their cocktails! For food, we ordered okonomiyaki to share, karaage curry, and sukiyaki curry udon. The price here is so reasonable and the portions are very large. If you haven't been DEFINITELY try!"
KINKA IZAKAYA MONTREAL,Japanese,"1624 Rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest Montreal, QC H3H 2S7 Canada",QC,45.4893389,-73.584505,5,"Ordered almost everything on the menu.
Must try: cold noodles udon, fried chicken(karagge), sushi, cheese curry rice!

Don't recommend the fried stuff beside chicken because they all tasted burnt and bitter.

Overall 10/12 dishes were good
One of the best Jp restaurants in the street"
KINKA IZAKAYA MONTREAL,Japanese,"1624 Rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest Montreal, QC H3H 2S7 Canada",QC,45.4893389,-73.584505,3,"We came here on a Wednesday night, we didn't have any reservations but we didn't mind sitting at the ""bar area"".

It's a cute little place that has an open chicken

When we walked in, you can instantly see the interaction between the employees which I loved, they were calling out of each other when a customer was coming in or leaving and also when it came to food.

The service was good, we ordered and the food came in pretty fast

We ordered Miso soup, seaweed and tofu salad, veggie dumplings, udon carbonara and the salmon tataki.

This is a tapas restaurant so the portions arent huge.

My favorite was the udon carbonara is was creamy but not to heavy and also the veggie dumplings.

The seaweed and tofu salad was not that good, there was barely any seaweed or even dressing in the salad, it was mostly mixed greens.
And the salmon tataki was a tease there was only 4 pieces that we shared.

We didn't get any drinks so I cannot comment on that.

Overall it was good and not expensive, if you like to share good this is a good place but not the best Izakaya in Montreal.

They also have locations in Toronto and New York."
KINKA IZAKAYA MONTREAL,Japanese,"1624 Rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest Montreal, QC H3H 2S7 Canada",QC,45.4893389,-73.584505,5,"I only discovered this restaurant this year and came back 4 times so far because of its great food and ambiance! The host even recognized me!

I strongly recommend this place for birthdays because of its festive atmosphere and the warm hospitality of the staff. They give one small matcha cheesecake for the birthday person so if you want to have something for the whole group, you can also order the assorted dessert in extra.

My favourite among appetizers is the sashimi salad and among tapas, the Tokyo calamari! For the noodles, the stir-fried beef udon is very good, and is not too salty and for the sizzling stone rice bowl, the curry cheese smells extremely good and can be smelled meters away! I wish however they didn't get rid of the pork tonkatsu curry on the menu!

I can't wait to come back to try their lunch menu and their terrasse during summer!

(sorry, I didn't take pics of all the food I ate. Was too busy eating!)"

It cost around 50$ for the beef soup + pork with rice + 2x potatoes and fried chicken. So quite cheap ! We were the only one at that moment and there was no music in the background so we couldn’t talk much I was too shy to talk in the quiet place.  I felt watched and heard haha
So I still recommend :)"

This small family-owned humble business doesn't look like much from the outside (or the inside) but don't let appearances deceive you. The food is RIDICULOUSLY good. The owner is INCREDIBLY friendly, hospitable and honest. This is one of the rare places that I actually feel deserves 20%+ tipping.

The beef noodle soup is easily one of the best in the city. EASY. This is a complete ""Sleeper OP"" restaurant. It is LEGITIMATELY one of those hidden gems.

The prices are fairly low too.

Strong recommendation for the Beef Noodle Soup and Almond Shrimp plate."

We had to wait a few minutes before we got a table outside. Ben was very courteous and explained the menu to us in English. I got their signature arugula salad with goat cheese while my boyfriend got duck Condit. The food was absolutely delicious. We finished our dinner with soe delicious chai tea crumble. We left the place satiated and full of gratitude.
Les Deux Gamins,French,"170 Rue Prince Arthur E Montreal, QC H2X 1B7 Canada",QC,45.515472,-73.570962,5,Quaint restaurant with welcoming and attentive service. The daily set menu was perfect. Escargots presented in a unique salad that was especially tasty. Ricotta pasta and chocolate profiteroles were perfectly prepared. Kids loved their French onion soup and even ate the onions this time! Beef tartare and fois gras delicious! Lamb shank tender.
Les Deux Gamins,French,"170 Rue Prince Arthur E Montreal, QC H2X 1B7 Canada",QC,45.515472,-73.570962,5,Food is amazing. Nice (normal) portion sizes (but maybe small for some people).

I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu. The only minor issue was that it was a little bit cold inside the restaurant, maybe it was because it had just opened for the evening, either way, it wouldn't stop me coming back again, I'll just wear a sweater next time!"

Rasputin,Russian,"617 Boulevard Decarie Saint-Laurent, QC H4L 3L2 Canada",QC,45.5098036,-73.675322,5,"One of the best Russian resturant in Montreal. We reserved a table for a Saterday (for our family post Covid - backing to normal life party🤣🤣) and the owner was kind enough to give us party menu although we were a small group.We reached there at 7pm and non of us thought that we would stay there for 5 hours.

Overall the tastes of all the meals were great and resturant serve them on time in a proper maner and size.Delsious food plus great music and dancing place made the expirence  unforgetable 🥰🥰🥰 .

Update 30 July 2022:  I went there with my international family (USA-Iran-Russia) once more and the experience was amazing🤗🤗. I resereved for party menu for 8 people for Saterday night. My family were in love with great music, tasty foods and positivity. The singer could sang in many launguages and owner also sang that night. We all danced  like there would be no tomorrow💃💃. My whole family were obsessed😎. Make sure to reserve before going and do not lose your chance to have great russian party 😍😍🥰"

Their pastries are good, but their sandwiches (Turkey pesto, etc) are what really stand out. They are a bit pricey at $12-$13 but they are delicious!

I decided to stop by on my way to the airport back to Vancouver. I grabbed some lunch and I grabbed a few items to take back with me for the plane ride. I love croissants so I decided to grab three to share with my family at home, but when I got home and opened the bag, I saw an extra croissant!! it felt so nice that the staff tried to make my visit to the café a little extra special. 🙏 I will be recommending this place to everybody! The staff are truly kind, the food is absolutely delicious (pesto is unreal) and the vibe is phenomenal. Thank you for giving me a wonderful experience. I cannot wait to come back again someday!! 💕"

There’s an outdoor terrace that’s also nice during good weather. Service was quick, but we only ordered drinks. We got iced-chai for $7 each. It’s quite pricy for a glass of chai half-filled with glass. My friend the chai was dull. I thought it was good after I added an alternative sugar (I think it was called Twinner). You also have many vegan milk options in addition to the regular. But the windows and the vibe is so cute!"

Au Pied de Cochon,Canadian (New),"536 Avenue Duluth E Montreal, QC H2L 1A9 Canada",QC,45.5221259,-73.5743815,2,"Disappointed with the food. We got the oysters (great appetizer), Foie Gras Poutine (pretty good but slightly overpriced), and finally the duck in the can.
Duck in the can is overly overhyped, unflavoured and overpriced. For $60 I was expecting something exceptional. We got a nice show and hard duck breast. The cabbage was not that good and the meat was hard and unsalted.
Maybe different strokes different folks but my 2nd time at Au Pied was a big disappointment."
Au Pied de Cochon,Canadian (New),"536 Avenue Duluth E Montreal, QC H2L 1A9 Canada",QC,45.5221259,-73.5743815,5,Completely worth the hype. Had the foie gras poutine and the duck in a can to share.

From the first bite I had it brought back memories of what I was eating when I was in Napoli and Arezzo.

Dont be fooled by the outside signage the owner told me he knows and are planning on re-branding. I am so lucky I found this place and will be coming more and more. I swear this is the best Italian food I have had in a long time.

Love that you can pick your sauce and pasta and have it be very customizable. The chef is also very friendly and personable. Will definitely be coming here again to try their pizzas and more!

Was not enough food as were told by them but survived . Kofta and shahi paneer curry was same , dal tadka was good and also cheese chilly ."
Pushap,Indian,"5195 Rue Paré Montreal, QC H4P 1P4 Canada",QC,45.4975343,-73.6538838,4,"I love the food here. I have tried most the  dishes on the menu and everything tastes nice. Been coming here for years now and will continue to.
Post covid, the taste changed(still tastes good) for few items, may be the chef changed. Earlier, it was more home like now its little spicy and more oily.

Requires some efforts on regular cleanliness of the washrooms."
Pushap,Indian,"5195 Rue Paré Montreal, QC H4P 1P4 Canada",QC,45.4975343,-73.6538838,1,"I ordered on Uber.  Gravy of Paneer korma is as thin as Dal.  Chapaties are thick and cold.   Totally unhappy with the quality.  Not only that food is delivered without cutlery and tissue paper.  How can you eat .. ?
.
My advice to owner.. TRY RESTAURANT  TGG.. nearby you.  You will see the difference of food quality.   Concentrate on Quality rather than Quantity."
Pushap,Indian,"5195 Rue Paré Montreal, QC H4P 1P4 Canada",QC,45.4975343,-73.6538838,5,"Great affordable local spot! Lots of people coming and going which shows it’s a staple in the neighbourhood. Worth the detour, especially if you like indian food and/or vegetarian options."
Pushap,Indian,"5195 Rue Paré Montreal, QC H4P 1P4 Canada",QC,45.4975343,-73.6538838,5,"Best place for vegetarians. Tastes like home made food, reasonable prices, good staff, fast servings. Best in everything. Will recommend everyone to visit this restaurant. Prices are really really good."
Marché Méli-Mélo,Haitian,"640 Rue Jarry E Montreal, QC H2P 1V7 Canada",QC,45.5447239,-73.6276151,3,"Food is affordable, tasty and the portions are generously served the few times I've ordered (3-4x).
It's better calling before going to be sure there's enough fresh food. Man answering the phone is not friendly at all and has 0 customer service.
He refused to take my order even though the usual lady is ok in preparing the plates a bit in advance (since there's only street parking). Not really a place to dine in cuz the tables are quite small. Place could definitely use some improvements and be more clean."
Marché Méli-Mélo,Haitian,"640 Rue Jarry E Montreal, QC H2P 1V7 Canada",QC,45.5447239,-73.6276151,1,"I visited this Haitian restaurant in Montreal several years ago, thanks to a recommendation from a dear friend. Back then, my experience was fantastic. The service was satisfactory, the portions were generous, and the food itself was incredibly tasty. I often made it a point to stop by this place before heading back to my town.

However, over the past 5 to 6 years, I've observed some noticeable changes in the level of customer service and the overall layout of the restaurant. It seems that the owners have missed an opportunity to enhance their profits by not considering the logistical aspects of the establishment. There's room for improvement in this regard.

One of the major changes I noticed is the declining level of customer service. The staff appears to lack the same level of care and dedication they once had. During a recent visit, I brought some friends to experience the authentic Haitian cuisine. Unfortunately, I encountered an unpleasant situation when I had to return to the front cashier to make a change to my order, despite clearly specifying my desired rice type. The staff in the kitchen were rude and insisted that it wasn't on the receipt, instructing me to go back to the front to pay for it. This encounter left a sour taste in my mouth.

Furthermore, upon reaching home and indulging in my meal, I noticed a decline in the quality of the food, particularly the beef. As a lover of the “Legume”, I've been consistently disappointed by the dish at this restaurant in recent times.

I truly hope the owners take note of these customer concerns and consider making changes to enhance the overall experience. It would be wonderful if they paid attention to reviews like these. I believe there are customers like myself who long for a return to the delicious food and enjoyable dining experience that this restaurant once offered."
Marché Méli-Mélo,Haitian,"640 Rue Jarry E Montreal, QC H2P 1V7 Canada",QC,45.5447239,-73.6276151,1,"I went in today after a recommandation. As some other previous comments the customer service is seriously lacking. I don’t know Haitian cuisine so I was asking the cashier what the dishes are and the whole time I felt like I was bothering her. She told me “beef Tasso” was “Griot” but with beef, and didn’t even bother explaining the different sizes. I don’t even know if it’s true but what I ate today was nothing like the griot I had before. A few slices of an extremely dry meat, I couldn’t even finish the dish, and to top it all I paid 27.50$ for that plate + an accra (Aran kind of who she said was 5$! For a single accra!). Very disappointed."
Marché Méli-Mélo,Haitian,"640 Rue Jarry E Montreal, QC H2P 1V7 Canada",QC,45.5447239,-73.6276151,1,Terrible customer service! The ladies who prepare the food should take a course on how to treat their customers. They are very disrespectful and have no manners. You can't even ask them a simple question. I will not be coming here again and I do not recommend this place. There are so many better Haitian restaurants than this place.
Marché Méli-Mélo,Haitian,"640 Rue Jarry E Montreal, QC H2P 1V7 Canada",QC,45.5447239,-73.6276151,4,"I ate a lot of griot when working in Haiti. This one is excellent! Portions are very generous and include all the trimmings: rice (djondjon, collé, blanc), banan pese, sauce, pikliz, ... add an order of akra to this.
They also have t'assoit, lambi, ... everything to make you feel in Haiti."
La Banquise,Poutineries,"994 Rue Rachel E Montreal, QC H2J 2J3 Canada",QC,45.5253117,-73.5746721,5,"Hands down, the best poutinerie! I feel like they are crafting art. When I can't tell where the fries end and the meat begins, they have really crafted something special. This place is always busy, but the staff are always calm and relaxed. They definitely have good systems in place here. I've been here 3 times now, and it's a must visit whenever I am in Montreal."
La Banquise,Poutineries,"994 Rue Rachel E Montreal, QC H2J 2J3 Canada",QC,45.5253117,-73.5746721,1,"Everybody told me that this is the best poutinerie, but now I doubt it. We had to wait 40 minutes for the food, and when the food arrived, the fries were cold (like old ones), the beef, onions and sausage were burned. Maybe it was because of the amount of people, but the quality of the food should not go down in such a renowned restaurant."
La Banquise,Poutineries,"994 Rue Rachel E Montreal, QC H2J 2J3 Canada",QC,45.5253117,-73.5746721,5,"The hype is real!
When we arrived here the line up was pretty long (we also came on a Saturday)

The line didn’t take to long and we eventually got a table on the terrase (outside) one thing to note is that they don’t serve alcohol outside. They had really good music out on the patio as well.

We ordered the regular size poutine, 1 classic and the other with smoked meat on top. They were both divine!

Beware if you order the grande it’s MASSIVE!
poutine so good we wanted to come back the next day to eat more."
La Banquise,Poutineries,"994 Rue Rachel E Montreal, QC H2J 2J3 Canada",QC,45.5253117,-73.5746721,5,"Good and delicious food. Poutines are really good and so are the burgers. We ordered a vegetarian option and it was too yummy. My wife liked the veg burger. The ambience is good. They have an ATM machine inside. Sometimes they have a long queue too, so plan accordingly."

I tried the poutine with pickles and ground beef and loveddd it! I didn’t know what to expect the pickle to taste like but it all was great together.

I’d say it’s a must try when in Montreal!"

I loved that we were able to order our food from our phones and the server just comes and brings it to you. Their empanadas were different from what I’m used to, crunchy in the outside and soft in the inside. The areperas itself were tasty. Service was great and atmosphere was amazing. Loved my experience there!"
Arepera,Venezuelan,"73 Rue Prince Arthur E Montreal, QC H2X 1B4 Canada",QC,45.5148272,-73.5719771,5,"Delicious food and fantastic service! This was my first time eating arepas and Arepera exceeded my expectations. To eat, we had the cheese empanadas, la llanera de pollo arepa, and dominó con plátano arepa and each item was exceptional - light, crispy and flavourful. Not to mention the house made sauces! Yum!

What made our visit truly perfect was the staff. Our server, Pascual, was phenomenal! He was friendly, checked in often, and made us laugh. He also went above and beyond to ensure we were well taken care of, such as clean up our baskets regularly, provide fresh napkins, and refill our waters consistently. Mali and Norah were also lovely, each stopping by to ensure we received our food quickly, we were satisfied, and also humoured us while we waited.

Well done, Arepera. You have fantastic food and fantastic service! An unbeatable combination when choosing where to eat. We will certainly be coming back again soon."

It was so good that I'd want to come back just to eat that. Our waiter Mathieu was super friendly too and he took the time to recommend us which drinks to choose. He made our resto experience super enjoyable - he definitely deserves a raise!! We ordered the Rio Grande dish to split between 4 people and even at the end, there was still plenty of food to bring back home for each of us."

Mother clucker sandwich- hmm it’s good in general but the chicken is a bit dry.

The ambiance and service were fantastic, and the staff, were all dudes dressed in shorts and t-shirts, giving a relaxed and welcoming vibe.

The chicken satay was absolutely amazing, the other dishes and cocktails were good as well. I highly recommend this place."
Satay Brothers,Singaporean,"3721 Rue Notre-Dame Ouest Montreal, QC H4C 1P8 Canada",QC,45.4793169,-73.5818739,4,"Amazing place. Great staff and ambiance. Music is a bit too loud but very good. Everything was delicious. Papaya salad and pork buns are a must.

Highly recommend to share the plates. We shared 5 plates and the desert plate for 3 people and it cost us under 40$ before tax and tip.

Place gets packed everyday, reco to get there before 7:30-8pm."
Satay Brothers,Singaporean,"3721 Rue Notre-Dame Ouest Montreal, QC H4C 1P8 Canada",QC,45.4793169,-73.5818739,2,"The music was extremely loud when we visited. Impossible to make any conversation even with the person sitting next to you. Food was alright, would have enjoyed it better if we could've talked to each other.
We made a reservation for 11 people and one person didn't show up. They split the 11th person's charge evenly over our bills; even though they only brought food for the 10 of us.

Unfortunately, I would not go again."
Satay Brothers,Singaporean,"3721 Rue Notre-Dame Ouest Montreal, QC H4C 1P8 Canada",QC,45.4793169,-73.5818739,4,A must for those who love Asian food but crave something different from the traditional flavors found in Chinatown. I suggest coming as a group and ordering many dishes to share. The umami is through the roof and can feel heavy if not paired with white rice. My personal favorites are the pork belly steamed buns and the laksa.
Satay Brothers,Singaporean,"3721 Rue Notre-Dame Ouest Montreal, QC H4C 1P8 Canada",QC,45.4793169,-73.5818739,5,"No resos for groups under 6, and I recommend getting there early. We arrived at 6:30pm on a Thursday and it was packed, we waited roughly 15-20 minutes for a spot for 2. They let you order drinks while waiting though, which is a great start.

Must try’s on the menu are the satay skewers with peanut sauce, the fried pork and shrimp rice rolls (not pictured, but we both agreed it was the best thing we tasted!), papaya salad, and the regular pork steam buns.

The shrimp buns were part of their specials, but it’s not as balanced and tasty as the pork buns. If you’re stuck between the two, go pork.

For the noodles, I would go for the mussel and chorizo noodles instead of the shrimp and cuttlefish.

But really, everything on the menu is excellent. We also have our amazing experience to thank to our server Carl, who went above and beyond in the service.

100% recommend!"

Limited beer choices but quality. Menu out of sight. We had the Caesar salad, Pork Cheeks, Octopus and Beef. All amazing and each with their own unique flavor. Look if you’re American looking for mega servings this is not the place. This is relaxed fine dining, small plates, big flavors. Cocktails excellent and wine selections almost overwhelming! Staff is down to earth and informative. Don’t miss this place."
Le Majestique,Bars,"4105 Boulevard Saint-Laurent Montreal, QC H2W 1Y7 Canada",QC,45.5175694,-73.580276,5,"Very recommended their oyster. It comes in 3 different types. All of them are fresh and tasty (come with natural sweetness). Other food is very well-seasoned.
The mousse de foie surprises me because of its creamy, fatty flavour with a bit of bitterness from the liver and sweetness from the pear and brûlée on top.
Their hot dog is pretty big (obviously it’s 12 inches). The mixed salad balances the flavour well.
The whelks is a hit-or-miss tho.
I will come back to taste more of their dishes and drinks. If you don’t come for their food, you can try their drinks because they have a very long list for them."

If you get Michelle as you server, you'll be in great hands - very attentive, attention to detail, and great recommendations. The hostess was also a pleasure to talk to over the phone. Duck tartar was very delicious, we'll come back for the pork belly, and next time we'll do 24 oysters instead of 12. Fries are absolutely worth getting. The vibe is great as it gets busy but not overwhelming, and the decor is spot on. We make an effort to visit all our favorite places everytime we come back to Montreal (as we are from Toronto) and this place is on our list. Thank you Michelle for giving us such a great night!

Bol Orange,Korean,"983 Boulevard Décarie Montreal, QC H4L 3M6 Canada",QC,45.514161,-73.6822895,5,I love this spot! The one spot in Montreal with some of the BEST kimbap. I always go here for the spicy tuna kimbap (it’s to die for !!!!!). I believe it’s a family owned business and they have great food for great prices. Also very close to the metro for those of you who don’t drive (metro cote vertu). I also always get their dak galbi stew (spicy chicken. Stew with rice) so good!! Must try!!!
Bol Orange,Korean,"983 Boulevard Décarie Montreal, QC H4L 3M6 Canada",QC,45.514161,-73.6822895,4,"Update april 24 2023

They finally hired a new good staff.  It was a full house at 6 pm  Saterday.  Prices went up again but so did service snd quality.

Wings    10/10
Bi bim bap   10/10   i like to to have a little more crust at the bottom of the bowl but it is a personal choice
Ramen noodles  9/10    good broth and flavor

----
Very good fried chicken. Not many places offer wings, most offer half or whole chicken.   Bi bim bap was very good.    The noodles and kim chi were ok. The is the only place in Montréal/ Toronto that has pork bone  soup, bi bim bap and fried chicken.  Very good prices.   The food is timed and comes out at the same time (most of the time)"
Bol Orange,Korean,"983 Boulevard Décarie Montreal, QC H4L 3M6 Canada",QC,45.514161,-73.6822895,3,"SERVICE: Came here when they first opened, food is always good. Went back a couple of times recently, the person that works in the front is a bit slow, we had to ask for cultery, dishes, napkins. When we were ready to leave, which we waiting 20minutes to have the bill, we asked and the person went back to clean some spoons, or going into the back doing God knows what. Asked a second time and still proceeds on doing something else so we finally walked to the front and asked the owner to have the bill. As for the service, I’d give 3/5. The waiter would leave tables dirty and not clean up the table until there is a line up. Not very efficient.

FOOD: love their spicy tuna kimbap, chiken cutlet is very good but the chiken is always over-fried, as it was super hard to chew and burnt.

We love coming to this place but for sure has some adjustments to make."

Loved the stained glass. But be prepared to pay for this. It cost me a small fortune. I love Hibiki but not willing to pay 54 bucks plus tax and tip. This is crazy. I did not like the octopus and frozen fries but everything else was A-1. I ordered the beef wellington and loved it.

Bar George,British,"1440 Rue Drummond Montreal, QC H3G 1V9 Canada",QC,45.4990691,-73.5757489,4,"I recently visited Bar George in Montreal for a late-night outing. Initially, I intended to have dinner, but unfortunately, the kitchen was closed by the time I arrived. However, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise as I got the opportunity to sample their drinks instead.

Despite the fact that there were empty seats, I had to wait in line for about 20 minutes to get a seat at 1am, which was a bit of a letdown. However, once I was seated, I was quite impressed by the atmosphere. The interior is beautifully designed, giving off a high-class vibe that I thoroughly enjoyed.

Overall, even though my visit didn't go as initially planned, I had a good time at Bar George. The ambiance and the quality of the drinks made up for the initial hiccup. I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a classy spot to unwind in Montreal."
Bar George,British,"1440 Rue Drummond Montreal, QC H3G 1V9 Canada",QC,45.4990691,-73.5757489,5,"The place itself is a historical building with lovely carved wood, the dim setting and combinations of wood makes it a perfect dining space. I appreciate the staff allowing us to explore the second floor of the building!

We came during lunchtime. We ordered the hamburgers, they are so good! The buttery brioche bun topped with an amazing smokey caramelized onion and well seasoned beef patty perfectly encapsulated the combination of sweet and salty. The density of the burger felt perfectly balanced all throughout, although I believe the mayonnaise sauce served with the fries was too dense and did not compliment the lightness of the burger.

Unfortunately I could not take a picture of the burger as the lighting present with my phone was too bad.

The staff were very kind and helpful."

The food is absolutely delicious and it tastes so fresh! We had various starters to start and everything was great. From the salad to the hummus, it was delicious.

For the main plate, we’ve ordered the kafta brochette, the chicken brochette and the lamp chops… delicious!

The staff is friendly and helpful.

I recommend it!"

Beroya Restaurant,Mediterranean,"3455 Boulevard Saint-Martin O Laval, QC H7T 1A2 Canada",QC,45.5557034,-73.752086,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Beroya, a Syrian cuisine restaurant located in Laval, and I must say that it was an amazing experience. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a lovely Middle Eastern and Syrian look and feel that immediately transported me to a different world.

But the real star of the show was the food. I was lost what to order, but the staff were incredibly helpful and provided excellent recommendations. I ended up trying several dishes, and each one was more delicious than the last. The taste was mouthwatering, and the spices were just right, giving every bite the perfect kick.

One thing that really impressed me was how quickly the food was served. I didn't have to wait long at all, which is always a plus in my book. And once I was done with my main course, I made sure to taste the delicious dessert options. The ice cream and cotton candy were particularly noteworthy, and I found myself craving more even after I had finished.

Overall, I highly recommend Beroya for anyone who loves Middle Eastern and Syrian cuisine. The food is simply amazing, the staff are helpful and friendly, and the atmosphere is perfect for a night out with friends or family. Don't miss out on this hidden gem in Laval!"
Beroya Restaurant,Mediterranean,"3455 Boulevard Saint-Martin O Laval, QC H7T 1A2 Canada",QC,45.5557034,-73.752086,3,"It was perfect since I love exquisite food that is less than 500 calories, when seriously watching my weight . There individual dishes 30-40$ are dishes to die for, plate is cute, even smaller than regular plate, where they fit little bit of protein with grill veges - half med onion half med
tomato a half pepper and garnished with 5g of parsley and onion, pita sliced into few pieces; leaves your stomach much room for dessert 😋 So yummy and so little we finished our individual dish in less than 5 mins, this was first time in the history defeating McDonald's trio under 5 mins. Yes, you can order rice, potato and salad for extra extra charges. Of course, you can order chef choice platter for 55$/person, which supposedly fills the whole table. In short, there are better restaurants, gentleman serving us was nice."
Beaufort,Bistros,"6653 Rue St-Hubert Montreal, QC H2S 2M5 Canada",QC,45.5374437,-73.6056463,2,"Disappointed. The service was bad, even though the place was empty. We ordered the beet salad and found a hair in it. We complained about it and they offered us another plate of salad. We also ordered the lobster roll and it was okay. We asked for a smoothie with our order but it never came although we have paid for it. So, before leaving the restaurant, we claimed the smoothie and that’s when the server started making it. I think the smoothie was the only tasty thing we had at Beaufort.. unfortunately, it was a bad experience and we don’t think we will ever come back here again."

The atmosphere is very relax, the decor full of cute little details; a place where you feel comfortable and welcomed.

I got the salmon tartare and my friend the guédille with lobster and nordic shrimps. We were both really satisfied :)

Best aspect of this place is the service is attentive, everyone is kind and laid back. The kind of restaurant you can feel the staff is well treated and they work as a team. Fully recommend!"

We had all the space we needed. The private room even has its own bathroom. There are no stairs so accessibility was great for elderly guests.

If you want a hall but don't want hall prices, look no further!

The staff was excellent! Very accomodating and helpful.

I highly recommend this restaurant for events but also for dinner on the restaurant side."

Brazas Portugal,Portuguese,"169A Boulevard Sainte-Rose Laval, QC H7L 1L2 Canada",QC,45.615823,-73.7841454,3,"Very small restaurant. They give complimentary bread and olives which is nice.
We were 3, ordered one plate of chicken and a platter to share. The chicken was good but very salty. Didn't care for the rest of the meat, the pork seemed a bit over cooked and the sausage was chewy so we really only ate the chicken. Salad and fries were good. Portuguese beer was also pleasent, but a bit pricey. Waitress was nice, but the guy who served our drinks kept poring a 7up while looking at it and didn't stop until it overflowed on to the floor and served the glass sticky with no apology or offer to bring a new drink since the glass wasn't full. Very bizarre."
Brazas Portugal,Portuguese,"169A Boulevard Sainte-Rose Laval, QC H7L 1L2 Canada",QC,45.615823,-73.7841454,5,"What a terrific find in Laval! We had spicy grilled chicken and assorted meat plate with a very nice red house wine. The roasted meat with paprika was so delicious. Mum said she hadn't enjoyed a roasted chicken this much in decades. And for dessert a homemade Portuguese tartlet which was.perfect.
Service was fab. Simple setting which was just fine. Thank you to all the staff."
Brazas Portugal,Portuguese,"169A Boulevard Sainte-Rose Laval, QC H7L 1L2 Canada",QC,45.615823,-73.7841454,2,"The service was not impressive because it took a while which we did not mind thinking we will get the great food and fresh. we ordered a lot but the chicken was very dry and half of the plate was rather burned. my family went there before and said the chicken was not bad (when an older gentleman cooked it). next time we would rather go to Romados in Montreal.
pricey for the burned dry chicken if you ask me"
Brazas Portugal,Portuguese,"169A Boulevard Sainte-Rose Laval, QC H7L 1L2 Canada",QC,45.615823,-73.7841454,5,"Some of the best chicken you'll have in this areas. Char-grilled with a mild or spicy sauce topping. It almost tastes South American, and super delicious. Lunch special choices were chicken (light or dark), chorizo sausage, or grilled sardines, paired with pomme frites and a tasty salad. Had the breast and wing and the chicken literally falls off the bone. Parking is a little spotty but a public parking lot is about 200m away with a few more potential spots."
Grigio,Italian,"993 Boulevard Saint-Martin Ouest Laval, QC H7S 1M5 Canada",QC,45.5725149,-73.7203417,5,Food is delicious loved the calamari perfectly fried so far the best in Laval.
Grigio,Italian,"993 Boulevard Saint-Martin Ouest Laval, QC H7S 1M5 Canada",QC,45.5725149,-73.7203417,5,"Favourite restaurant, easy, in Laval.

This restaurant is one of my all time favourites in laval. I've come here over 30 times in my lifetime and it has never disappointed me. It's my family's go-to spot.

My favourite dish is the Scaloppine Alla Grigio. Veal, with a side of vegetables, and pasta. I usually ask for regattoni conspec as my pasta side. Absolutely delicious, the mushrooms and the veal in the Porto sauce are really good. (The picture was taken after I had already dug into it, I couldn't resist!) My sister gets the regattoni con spec as a dish and she loves it every time.

The appetizers here are also very good and popular with us. We have the calamari every time we come here, an easy 10/10, crispy and delicious. The newest one we had was the sausage, which was just pure bliss, sublime.

The desserts here too are great. I had the crème caramel and my sister had the crème brûlée, both super sweet and tasty.

Thank you so much for the impeccable service and food."
Grigio,Italian,"993 Boulevard Saint-Martin Ouest Laval, QC H7S 1M5 Canada",QC,45.5725149,-73.7203417,5,Extremely good.  Food arrived hot.  Our server believe her name was Eli was just fantastic.  We give her a 10 for professionalism.  Congrats to the whole team.  Will definitely be back.  We are about 40 minutes away from there but we'll worth the trip.  Thanks again de

Pretty nice decor, a bring your own wine restaurant you can’t miss, Food is good and well priced :) will definitely come back again.

The service was very good too!

The only problem were the fruit flies ~ fix that problem and it will be a definitely 5 stars :)"
Grigio,Italian,"993 Boulevard Saint-Martin Ouest Laval, QC H7S 1M5 Canada",QC,45.5725149,-73.7203417,2,"Food was excellent but service was awful.  It was a Saturday night, granted, but I've been to many other restaurants where it wasn't as slow. We were 10 people.   We were not all served our meal at the same time. Our waitress was more attentive to the men, especially mine!  She totally ignored me until she saw it was ME who paid the bill. Sweetheart,  your boss should remind you to treat ALL your customers the same.  I gave her a generous tip in spite of her embarrassing and inappropriate behaviour.

My friend said the same thing.  HER husband was served his meal before any of us!  He did not want to start eating while the rest of us waited for our entrées/meals..  but we all insisted he do so."
Restaurant Ermitage,Russian,"5024, ch de la Côte-des-Neiges Montreal, QC H3V 1G6 Canada",QC,45.4946327,-73.6185302,5,"✨Short review ✨
Decor, layout and music was great! Food was delicious! Service was impeccable!

✨More elaborate review✨
Firstly, when we walked in we were so happy with the ambience/atmosphere of this restaurant; the decor, music and layout were lovely!

Second, this was our first time trying Russian cuisine and I personally wasn’t sure about what I was reading about on the menu. After ordering, I realized they have pictures of all their meals on their website in the gallery section! I highly recommend to go take a look if you also are unfamiliar with Russian cuisine!

Furthermore, I am so pleased to say that the food was DELICIOUS. Generous portions, flavourful and truly satisfying. Plus, the bread, butter and sour cream were all homemade. (I’m sure more was homemade but this is what we specifically found out was homemade!) I’ll post photos of what my husband and I got for reference!

Third, the lady who served us, I wish I had asked her her name, was so warm, kind, generous, helpful and pleasant! She is a gem and 100% added to the amazing experience we had. Such attention to detail and care!

All in all, please go check this restaurant out! It is worth it!

PS: Most photos are from the website; I forgot to take pictures of the food myself -website photos are true to what we were served."

The appetizers are fantastic! Main course? Kiev and Stroganoff, of many options - FANTASTIC!

Finished our evening experience with a mouth melting honey cake with a dripping of strawberry glaze... and a coffee.

My word selection may not identify the specific menu listed entrees we enjoyed though, I'm sure you have a quality understanding of our experience.

Amazing!"

The food was delicious and tasted like the cuisine I had eaten in Russia.  This restaurant  is obviously popular and has a number of regulars who frequent.  Make sure to call ahead since they regularly have parties that block out the whole place."

We recently had an over 20 people celebration there, everything was seamless, from the delicious food on the table, amazing and thoughtful service, attention to detail and personal touches, they have surpassed our expectations. All guests were complementing how good the food was.
The experience was just as positive when i went there for supper with a friend
This restaurant has been in business for many years and they value their reputation and maintain their standards of quality, you will not be disappointed.
Will be back soon for sure"
Sen Vang,Vietnamese,"5690 Avenue Victoria Montreal, QC H3W 2P8 Canada",QC,45.4920358,-73.6327757,4,"We travelled to Montreal and visited this restaurant three times within a week. We really like the Bun Bo Hue there, the soup is so tasty."
Sen Vang,Vietnamese,"5690 Avenue Victoria Montreal, QC H3W 2P8 Canada",QC,45.4920358,-73.6327757,5,It's a small restaurant but offers an authentic Vietnamese delicious food. I love bún bò hue (spicy noodles soup) that has a very good taste of lemongrass. Bbq pork is delicious too! Service is quick and professional! It's a must-try restaurant in busy Montreal!
Sen Vang,Vietnamese,"5690 Avenue Victoria Montreal, QC H3W 2P8 Canada",QC,45.4920358,-73.6327757,5,"Sen Vang is one of the best Pho in Montreal.  In these times of pandemic it’s hard to transport soup.  The menu is reduced but the best spicy soup is still there.  I love their Pho and I am a regular. Sony (owner) is one who can pack the take away really well. The spring rolls are fantastic.  It’s a perfect lunch on a cold afternoon hop off and pick up the soup and you can heat up the broth at home in case it’s not as hot as you would like it.

Update: By this time the ownership has changed and the Pho is still very good.  Now there are a more items on the menu and we hand a wonderful time.  The place accepts credit and debit cards now.  I would recommend this place."

Super good wine. I'm a bit disappointed about the portion size of the ribs. It is a good portion. However, if you've been in the past, it changed. You have fewer sides than before. Overall, it's a super good place for chicken and beef. Amazing host."
Bâton Rouge Steakhouse & Bar,Seafood,"3035 Boulevard le Carrefour Laval, QC H7T 1C8 Canada",QC,45.5694188,-73.7518262,4,"It's a hit or miss place depending on your waiter/waitress. The food is good 90% of the time (if it's not after your first few bites, they are happy to take it back in the kitchen to cook it again). I wouldn't mind coming here if I needed an idea on what to eat for dinner. Obviously, you come here for the ribs."

Service is Top Shelf!!
Portions are very generous!
Baton Rouge has a rather unique system whereby the wait staff are constantly attempting to be aware of each others tables.  What this means for the customer is Fast Efficient Service.  If your meal is 'up' in the kitchen, and your server is not there, but another is -- that server will bring it out to you.  Simple things like water refills and clearing dishes is rarely missed.
For starters we had the Calamari.  it was cooked to perfection, tender and crispy on the outside, served with Smoke Show Aioli. The Seared Ahi Tuna Salad (the tuna was 'melt-in-your-mouth' delectable)
The New York Strip Loin** ordered Rare was incredible!.
We also went 'overboard' by adding a side of Sizzling Shrimp and Scallops.
**The waitress (Maria) was quick to ask if I wanted the steak off the regular menu - or the special (upgrade that came with starter salad, and the steak was topped with a generous slice of Brie and Pan Seared Mushrooms and accompanied with Green Beans and choice of second side).**
Our meal was capped off with the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake to share.
The prices are quite fair, considering the exceptional service, and generous portions!  It seems rare that you can find a restaurant where the entire waitstaff seem happy to serve, are very friendly and efficient in their work!"
Nouilles Zhonghua,Noodles,"908 Rue Sherbrooke O Montreal, QC H3A 1G3 Canada",QC,45.5032979,-73.5749436,5,"I came here for lunch on a Thursday with my friend. I ordered the Vegetable Noodle combo and my friend ordered the Small Special Lanzhou Beef Noodle combo, both with spicy cucumber. Everything was very delicious. My Vegetable Noodle was a nice generous portion; both the the noodles and the vegetables were cooked perfectly, and the broth was very tasty. The spicy cucumber was crunchy and sweet, which I really really liked.

It's a small restaurant, with maybe 20 seats. I'd say it's more of a place where people just come, eat and then leave; less of a place where people sit and chat, especially during weekday lunch rush because it gets really busy.

Service was very efficient. Even though we were sitting tightly in a corner, the waitress checked in on us and filled our glass of water."
Nouilles Zhonghua,Noodles,"908 Rue Sherbrooke O Montreal, QC H3A 1G3 Canada",QC,45.5032979,-73.5749436,5,"As a fan of authentic Chinese noodle dishes, I absolutely loved this place. I had the large Beef Noodle Soup with the 三細 (San xi) noodles, with the shredded tofu skin as an appetizer. The texture of the tofu was perfect, almost exactly like a firm curd cheese. The broth of the soup is extremely fragrant and tasty! But beware of the large portion, it's massive.

Only downsides to this place are that the interior is very cramped and there isn't a lot of seating. Also keep in mind that they only take cash and debit, no credit.

Very highly recommended!"
Nouilles Zhonghua,Noodles,"908 Rue Sherbrooke O Montreal, QC H3A 1G3 Canada",QC,45.5032979,-73.5749436,4,"The broth is very flavourful and the toppings are decent, the beef can be chewy at times. The noodles however are far too chewy for me and I wish they were softer. Still a decent experience. Place is very small and packed, and I visited in summer so can’t really recommend the place for its ambiance."
Nouilles Zhonghua,Noodles,"908 Rue Sherbrooke O Montreal, QC H3A 1G3 Canada",QC,45.5032979,-73.5749436,4,"Western chinese noodle soup classic with all the fragrance and flavors. It's all well balanced, the noodle are freshly made in store and you can watch it from the front window on the street, really cool. Professional and efficient staff. Quick service, you have to pay before you eat. The prices are fairly good with 15$ for the large bowl. The cucumber side is very good a must try! Plan to go back to try their other soups and noodles size. I recommend this place."
Nouilles Zhonghua,Noodles,"908 Rue Sherbrooke O Montreal, QC H3A 1G3 Canada",QC,45.5032979,-73.5749436,5,I thing this place is one of the best Chinese noodles in Montreal. The service is nice and server was easygoing with us. The noodles were delicious. Highly recommend.
Ave Seoul,Korean,"885 Boulevard Décarie Montreal, QC H4L 3M2 Canada",QC,45.5128542,-73.6802036,3,"To put it simple, not the best but not the worst Korean restaurant out there. Food was okay but nothing too special about it.

Only one waiter doing everything from cash to serving food so keep that in mind if you go.He was very nice though."
Ave Seoul,Korean,"885 Boulevard Décarie Montreal, QC H4L 3M2 Canada",QC,45.5128542,-73.6802036,5,"The kimbap was great, it was freshly made; soft rice, perfect vegetable crunch and just very delicious.

Ave Seoul,Korean,"885 Boulevard Décarie Montreal, QC H4L 3M2 Canada",QC,45.5128542,-73.6802036,5,"Although the restaurant could use a fresh coat of paint, you will be impressed by the huge variety of korean dishes present on the menu.
They offer excellent service during lunch and the bulgogi porc and rice cakes are just as good."
Ave Seoul,Korean,"885 Boulevard Décarie Montreal, QC H4L 3M2 Canada",QC,45.5128542,-73.6802036,1,"Despite ordering from them after they had come back from break, the food ordered (gimbap) was slightly dry. However what was more displeasing was the tteobeokki that was in a large container and barely filled 1/4 of the container.. barely had any spicy sauce inside the container along with the rice cake, to top it off, there was a piece of paper inside the container stuck on the food... wasted quite a large amount (for the total amount) for such little quantity which was also disappointing based on its quality. Wouldn't recommend ordering gimbap and tteobeokki, however I don't know how their other dishes taste like, so I will not comment on them."
Dinette Triple Crown,Southern,"6704 Rue Clark Montreal, QC H2S 3G2 Canada",QC,45.5313656,-73.6131456,5,"Okay, this place is AMAZING! the staff are so kind and the food is incredibly delicious. The gravy, mac and cheese, and biscuits were really really good and the desserts as well! I got the key lime pie and also tried a bit of the blueberry cheesecake. I seriously can’t wait to go back and try their chicken and waffles and other rotational desserts!!"
Dinette Triple Crown,Southern,"6704 Rue Clark Montreal, QC H2S 3G2 Canada",QC,45.5313656,-73.6131456,4,"I liked the setup of the restaurant a lot, and the key lime pie is very good - not too sweet or too 'creamy' given the balance of the white chocolate mousse and the sour lime cream. However though I find the mac and cheese a little too salty so I had to keep on drinking water... but still it's the best mac and cheese I've had so far!"
Dinette Triple Crown,Southern,"6704 Rue Clark Montreal, QC H2S 3G2 Canada",QC,45.5313656,-73.6131456,3,"The fried chicken was decent. It was freshly fried so that made it taste good enough, but the batter felt a little off, maybe seasoning, maybe oil too hot, and the breast was a little dry. But overall, the biscuit was amazing, mashed potatoes and gravy were good and the waffles were tasty.

We also got a derby pie, if I remember the name correctly, and it tasted very sweet but not in a bad way, but the crust was very hard, dry and felt old.

I will give this place another chance at a later time. Hoping for a better experience!"
Dinette Triple Crown,Southern,"6704 Rue Clark Montreal, QC H2S 3G2 Canada",QC,45.5313656,-73.6131456,1,"Ordered sweet tea, waffles and fried chicken. Total is about 30$. Waffles and tea were good but the fried chicken was old, dry and under seasoned. You could get better chicken at your local grocery store where they let the pieces sit under a lamp for 16 hours at a time, and it would only cost you 8$. When chicken is the only protein you have, better make it good if you dare to charge that much.."
Dinette Triple Crown,Southern,"6704 Rue Clark Montreal, QC H2S 3G2 Canada",QC,45.5313656,-73.6131456,5,"I usually get the fried chicken and had tried some of the sides such as the coleslaw, mashed potatoes, hush puppies, pinto beans and buttermilk biscuit.

They have tables inside and on the terrace too. The vibe of the place is a relaxed one, almost teleporting you to beautiful Mexico.
I found it a great place to savor the traditional Mexican dishes. Food was fresh, well seasoned and brought to the table pretty fast."
El Rey del Taco,Mexican,"232 Rue Jean-Talon E Montreal, QC H2R 1S7 Canada",QC,45.5364394,-73.6159795,5,"If you're in the mood for some delicious Mexican food, El Rey Del Taco next to the farmers market is a must-visit spot. We tried their pork tacos and enchiladas de mole, and they were equally as delicious! The pork was juicy and flavorful, and the mole sauce on the enchiladas was rich and delicious.

One thing to keep in mind is that El Rey Del Taco doesn't serve alcohol(at least they are not on menu)

Overall, I highly recommend El Rey Del Taco!"
El Rey del Taco,Mexican,"232 Rue Jean-Talon E Montreal, QC H2R 1S7 Canada",QC,45.5364394,-73.6159795,4,"Good service and beautiful interiors. My tacos were good except they were a little salty (it’s easy for carnitas to be salty tho). The churro was to die for, will definitely come back"
El Rey del Taco,Mexican,"232 Rue Jean-Talon E Montreal, QC H2R 1S7 Canada",QC,45.5364394,-73.6159795,5,El Rey Del Taco is The place in Montreal for authentic tacos. Make sure you order by weight. Their al pastor is incredible. I'd recommend about 250g of meat per person.

Roch le Coq,Chicken Shop,"1541 Avenue Van Horne Montreal, QC H2V 1L4 Canada",QC,45.5186319,-73.616789,4,"I tried Roch le Coq on a Friday night with a friend. The place was PACKED and they had about 15 Door dash orders waiting on top of the customers who ordered as take-out. I heard good things about the place and really wanted to try it.

I ordered the Rochy sandwich which was very small, but inexpensive (5.50$) which could explain the price. The presentation was good, the pickles as well. It had kimchi mayo inside which was really good. The fries don't come with the burger, you have to order them on the side, they were good as well. The sauce that came with them had a weird taste, I didn't really like it. They also don't have ketchup, which I found weird. My friend ordered the 2 piece combo which was 14,75$ for the chicken, fries and a coleslaw salad (a bit expensive for what it was).

Overall, the chicken was great but nothing out of the ordinary, it was tasty and juicy. We waited around 20 minutes for our orders which seems reasonable considering that it was a Friday night and there were a lot of people!!"

I really really really loved this spot over the weekend. We got a couple of things but this poutine from @rochlecoq doesn't have a single flaw tbh. It's perfecty fried and crispy chicken, heavenly gravy and unique hot sauce all blend together in this harmonious poutine.

Joséphine,Seafood,"4007 Rue Saint-Denis Montreal, QC H2W 2M4 Canada",QC,45.5208464,-73.5755691,5,"A small group of four, we shared the shrimp cocktail, had lobster risotto and the sea bass for two dinner.  The shrimp was tasty, sweet and completed by fresh horseradish and cocktail sauce.  The sea bass was wonderful, perfectly crisp, light and flaky in a tray bean gravy with thin roasted fennel bulb and crispy shoe string potatoes. We were a hungry group so everyone enjoyed their dishes that night, yet all felt the same the next day.  😊

In addition our server was wonderful and had great stories to share on the history of Montreal and the changes happening in the Latin quarter today."
Joséphine,Seafood,"4007 Rue Saint-Denis Montreal, QC H2W 2M4 Canada",QC,45.5208464,-73.5755691,4,"Enjoyed the food but wish we would have tried some different dishes. We had the catch of the day and the mussels, which were both tasty but nothing to rave about when it came to the flavour. The service was great and the restaurant has a fun vibe. Would definitely come back to try something else!"
Joséphine,Seafood,"4007 Rue Saint-Denis Montreal, QC H2W 2M4 Canada",QC,45.5208464,-73.5755691,2,"Restaurant we booked shut down due to an electricity issues so we stumble upon Josephine impromptu. I have to say our experience was not the best despite the high pricetag of the restaurant. To start off as I was tasting the wine I had to select from a mini wine list, I mentioned that the temperature of the wine was not adequate and the waiter proceeded to convince me that my mouth was probably detecting the wrong temperature cos he ""touched"" the bottle and it was ok.
The service was very slow, slow to take orders, slow for food to come, slow to check back, slow to get the check and slow to pay.

Had the oysters and mignonette as a starter and they were good.  The main was the octopus and really the dish was problematic. The octopus itself was chewy, tasteless, if not for a strong artificial smoke taste.  It came with a caponata that had never heard of Sicily and a tasteless artichaud puree.

Other guests had:

- The Cesar salad that was good and the salmon tartar that was average.

- The mussels were  hard as stone (not sure how that is possible, may be they were recooked) and not enjoyable to eat."
Joséphine,Seafood,"4007 Rue Saint-Denis Montreal, QC H2W 2M4 Canada",QC,45.5208464,-73.5755691,5,"Highly recommend this restaurant. The food is wonderful and the space is bright and decorated beautifully.

We loved the grilled oyster mushrooms--so good! Both the lobster risotto and the moules frites were amazing. Nothing but praises for this menu."
Joséphine,Seafood,"4007 Rue Saint-Denis Montreal, QC H2W 2M4 Canada",QC,45.5208464,-73.5755691,2,"Was really looking forward to a fine dining seafood restaurant experience. Instead was extremely disappointed in the food. , service and atmosphere. The server did not explain the dishes as they were served on your plate. The arctic char was a very small thin piece of dried out fish served with eggplant. She told us it was a large portion served with bok choy and potatoes. The wine by the glass was only 3 choices of very cheap quality white wine that did not go with the food at all. The music in the background was annoying and the entire atmosphere of the restaurant is unattractive and loud. It was also very pricey for that quality of food. I don’t usually give reviews but this one was necessary so as to let people know what to expect for their time and money."
Christinas Cuisine,Greek,"4367 Rue Notre Dame Laval, QC H7W 1T3 Canada",QC,45.5379561,-73.7585631,5,"Quite frankly possibly the most underrated Greek restaurant in Laval.

We got some takeout - it was ready very quick for a Saturday night. The pork gyro pita are fantastic, well balanced and stuffed to the brim. Pork is not too fatty. The moussaka was very good - probably the best we’ve had. Very fair prices.

I’m very interested in coming back and trying some of their other daily or weekly specials. The Greek meatballs, roasted pork or the lamb look amazing.

Glad we discovered this little gem. Don’t think we’ll need to go anywhere else in Laval to satisfy our Greek cravings. I think it deserves more recognition."
Christinas Cuisine,Greek,"4367 Rue Notre Dame Laval, QC H7W 1T3 Canada",QC,45.5379561,-73.7585631,5,"Welcome home. The food served here is a delightful showcase of traditional Greek cuisine, prepared with utmost care and attention to detail. What impressed me the most was the affordability of the dishes without compromising on taste or quality. It's truly a haven for those seeking authentic flavors at reasonable prices. I was in awe when I first glanced at the Skepasti platter that I ordered. And later, I was in absolute bliss after tasting it. The horiataki salad was also fantastic , the tomatoes were just perfect. As was the dill salad (psilokomeni) . The Greek potatoes will make you question every other potato you've eaten before. What was also a huge highlight was how tasty their olive oil was. They serve bread with your meal, and the olive oil tasted unlike any olive oil I've ever had. I could have drank an entire cup of it it was so good. The portions also are very generous. You are getting your money's worth.

The wines offered here are all imported from Greece, featuring a selection of high-quality wines. We were a party of 6 and we all thoroughly enjoyed each bottle we shared.

The ambiance of the restaurant is cozy and welcoming, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere to enjoy your meal. The friendly and attentive staff further enhanced the overall dining experience. Dom, our waiter took good care of us the entire evening. He helped us decide what to start with and made us feel confident in our selections based on what we liked and the portions .

If you're in Laval and craving traditional Greek cuisine at an affordable price, this restaurant in the Chomedey area is an absolute must-visit."

The staff is always so nice and the food is so good, the portions are big, also if you get a plate it already comes with tsatiki so you don't have to buy extra which I love because alot of places you need to buy extra.

They have a small little dinning area which is nice

Definitely a must to try honestly"

MR PATTY,Caribbean,"5312 Patricia Avenue Montreal, QC H4V 1Z2 Canada",QC,45.4602097,-73.6543728,4,"1st time and I found the patty to be very BIG in size and value.  I found the secret is to heat the patty either in oven, air fryer or toaster oven.  The pastry will be nice and crispy & fluffy.  If you microwave, the pastry will come out tuff and a bit hard to chew.  I found the to patty pastry was very thick and heavy overtaking the filling which seemed mildly spicy. Maybe it was the batch, but I wished there was more beef filling.  Anyhow, these are BIG patties.  Please, more filling, it would make them so much more enjoyable.  Thanks"

MR PATTY,Caribbean,"5312 Patricia Avenue Montreal, QC H4V 1Z2 Canada",QC,45.4602097,-73.6543728,2,"Am honestly disappointed. In the past, their beef patties actually tasted like beef patties. Bought a patty and I felt like I was eating a bread crumb patty with little pieces of meat here and there. I don't know if they are attempting to save money by cutting down on the beef and increasing the portion of bread crumb but it shows in taste, texture and appearance. It looks very pale compared to how was before. Hope they go back to their old recipe."
Well,Breakfast & Brunch,"4567 Rue Wellington Montreal, QC H4G 1W8 Canada",QC,45.4586604,-73.5675792,4,"Loved the buzz and vibe of the place.

We ordered a bottle of wine but it took quite a while to get it.  Another couple arrived after us and they got drinks well before us, so maybe we just didn’t get the right person.

The Enchiladas were great, although I would have loved to have a little hot sauce.

My wife had the Picante Grilled Shrimp and Calamari.  They were not picante…because we didn’t get the accompanying sauce.  Asked once…nothing.  Asked a second time and finally got it.  This would have been solved had our wait person return a few minutes after serving to see if all was good.

We did give an extra tip to one guy that was running around giving 100%.  Although he didn’t serve us, we noticed his hard work.  Wow.

Maybe we will get him next time!

I will return, and hope we have a better experience."

Chez Wafi,Lebanese,"597 Boulevard Côte Vertu Saint-Laurent, QC H4L Canada",QC,45.522665,-73.673327,5,"Very delicious food. The staff is super hospitable and welcoming.
The taste of the Kaak itself is amazing, as if I am taking a bite from home. (Very close taste to Kaak Abu Arab in Lebanon!)

By far, the Farfelu Kaakeh (3 cheese - Mozzarella, Akawi, Halloumi) is their signature Kaakeh. It is a MUST try.

I also ordered the Basterma & Cheese, as well as the Turkey and Cheese, very good taste, and the portions are big enough. If you are not a heavy Kaakeh eater, 1 Kaakeh is more than enough.

Prices are crazy good, compared to the size of the portion and ingredients the price is very acceptable.

Chez Wafi, chapeau bas, my expectations have been exceeded. Will I visit again, you bet I will.

The big plate full of cowboy bones made my mouth water. The marinated cowboy bones are very tasty, and the meat is very tender and easy to bite. It may be a little salty when eaten alone, but it is just right when paired with the black rice served by the store. Seasonal vegetables are also grilled, which is very appetizing and relieves greasy when paired with cowboy bones. We ordered the vegetarian tofu bibimbap. The bibimbap with sun eggs is very tempting. Bibimbap itself has only the aroma of rice and seasonal vegetables. The store will serve it with a Korean spicy sauce, which can be adjusted according to personal taste.
The hot sauce is also tempered, fragrant and not too spicy."

The seafood pancake was so light and crispy.....every bite had delicious veggies and seafood! Bimbimbap was on point but the star of the show was definitely the Pork Bone Soup (Gamja Tang).

They have a big selection of wines and a pretty big menu for cocktails aswell

This is a tapas restaurant so for those that like sharing it's perfect because the portions are not huge. It's perfect to get a few different things and share in between.

We got the oysters, the tuna tataki,the crab bites and also the salmon tartare. All of those were good. The only disappointment that I had was more of the tartare, I feel like the amount of salmon in the tartare was not enough and there were more of the other ingredients then the salmon in the tartare.(like tomato that looks like tartare but it's actually tomato).

Prices are not that expensive compared to other tapas restaurant in MTL

I definitely recommend this place, it's nice for a date night or to catch up with a friend. This location wasn't big."
La Bêtise,Tapas Bars,"6015 Saint-Hubert Montreal, QC H2S 2L8 Canada",QC,45.5346727,-73.5993408,4,The oysters and the sangria are delicious! One of the best sangrias I’ve ever had. But there’s no air conditioner and it gets very hot.  The fried calamari 👎
La Bêtise,Tapas Bars,"6015 Saint-Hubert Montreal, QC H2S 2L8 Canada",QC,45.5346727,-73.5993408,5,"Great place to go eat and drink! The asian fusion food is excellent. I was surprised that the poutine bibimbap tasted that good. The flavours blended well. The tuna tataki was amazing and calamari was good. The service is great as well but my only thing that I would neatpick would be the decor that needs a bit more love but besides that, very good place to come and eat with some friends!"
La Bêtise,Tapas Bars,"6015 Saint-Hubert Montreal, QC H2S 2L8 Canada",QC,45.5346727,-73.5993408,4,"Nice restaurant with a budget friendly menu.
Music and ambiance was nice and welcoming.
The oysters were really good.
My friend ordered crab bites, those were very good as well.
There was a dish I chose that wasn't really to my liking and the waitress immediately spoke with management and offered to replace it with something else from the menu. She suggested two that were her faves and I ended up with the Tuna Tataki. It did not disappoint. Excellent dish, right down to the details on the plate.
We also ordered a mocktail of one of their drinks and it was so refreshing.
Would definetly recommend this spot."
La Bêtise,Tapas Bars,"6015 Saint-Hubert Montreal, QC H2S 2L8 Canada",QC,45.5346727,-73.5993408,5,"Been wanting to go to la Bêtise for a long time and finallyhad the occasion to try.
They offered a special menu since it was their anniversary and we got to try their shrimp pasta with lobster bisque sauce.. If only it was on their menu all year long because it was EXCELLENT!
The truffle oil fries are a must! Lightly salted with a not too overpowering taste of truffle oil served with some kind of spicy mayo sauce.. Addicting!
Don't forget their 2$ oysters.. Had to order 2 platters, one as an appetizer and another for dessert."
Kam Shing,Chinese,"575 Boulevard Saint-Martin O Laval, QC H7M 1Y9 Canada",QC,45.5766059,-73.7133532,5,"Exactly as it was when it first opened on Cote Des Neiges 40+ years ago!  Food, Staff, owner...all the same and all is as good and cheap as it ever was back in the day, iconic!

It's not high end fancy, sexy presentation, it's just tasty, great, cheap American Chinese food that comes to your table fast, fresh and hot!  Service as always... very rapid and courteous!"
Kam Shing,Chinese,"575 Boulevard Saint-Martin O Laval, QC H7M 1Y9 Canada",QC,45.5766059,-73.7133532,1,"I went once in the past with my family, we really enjoyed the food but the service was pretty lacking. We decided to come back today, we had to wait 15 minutes to even get a table (when there were like 3 tables taken) and even then, we had to ask to get seated. We waited at least 30 minutes for someone to take our order until we asked someone, they said “a moment” and did not come back for another 10 minutes so we just left. If you have the patience of a saint and don’t mind waiting an eternity to eat, then the food is great, but they have to fix their customer service for sure, it would lowkey be less time consuming to go to the super market and cook the food yourself."
Kam Shing,Chinese,"575 Boulevard Saint-Martin O Laval, QC H7M 1Y9 Canada",QC,45.5766059,-73.7133532,4,"Pretty tasty food, tried the chicken with cashew nuts, fried rice and the salt and pepper shrimps, they were very good. The hot and sour soup could have used a little seasoning but everything else was very tasty, would definitely recommend if you're in the laval area"
Kam Shing,Chinese,"575 Boulevard Saint-Martin O Laval, QC H7M 1Y9 Canada",QC,45.5766059,-73.7133532,5,"Really great! I had their yang chow fried rice, general tao, salt and pepper squid. All were really good, portions are gigantic. Service was quick and courteous. This is my go to Chinese restaurant!"
Kam Shing,Chinese,"575 Boulevard Saint-Martin O Laval, QC H7M 1Y9 Canada",QC,45.5766059,-73.7133532,3,Hard to review. Good place for a family to eat at low price and soft taste. For my part i preferred to have my plate with more taste. But in the same time i may not chose thr speciality. To retry one day.
Tandoori Palace,Indian,"3424 Boulevard Cartier O Laval, QC H7V 1K2 Canada",QC,45.5390679,-73.7330499,5,"After seeing and reading couple of unpleasant comments on their website, I decided to try it out myself.. Actually I believe all those comments were not fair to them specially with about rudeness of the wait staff. All I have seen and have to say; wait staff was kind, pleasant - respectful and top of the action….. In regards to food; I had a butter chicken, which was delicious fresh and had a good taste of the flavor. Rice and their non was fresh hot. Vegetable dish that I had was quite tasty as well. Our server was ( Harsh) special thanks to him in regards to explaining the menu and recommendations that he made. He was quite knowledgeable and having complete understanding of the menu. I can’t really remember the waiters name she was kind and walking around with water jar going table to table for refilling glasses. Overall we had an exceptional service and authentic Indian cuisine!!! I am not really very close to them otherwise I would have become their regular customer. But definitely I will go back and try some other delicious foods. P.S. ( to the owner or manager; please disregards all the previous negative comments about your wait staff. They all work very hard and they represent your business… Stop investigating all the fake comments about them. I seen it and witnessed that they are very welcoming and kind…. )"
Tandoori Palace,Indian,"3424 Boulevard Cartier O Laval, QC H7V 1K2 Canada",QC,45.5390679,-73.7330499,5,"This is our go-to for Indian. With the monopoly in Laval, there’s no need to head to Jean Talon anymore. Their butter chicken is absolutely spot on. Naan is fantastic. Preferred the korma dish elsewhere, but still a really solid spot for comfort food. Bring your own wine & friendly service - even when they’re super busy."
Tandoori Palace,Indian,"3424 Boulevard Cartier O Laval, QC H7V 1K2 Canada",QC,45.5390679,-73.7330499,5,"Wow. That's a place I would definitly go back to. Food is so good and the service is nice! You have a lot of choices & Naan bread is huge !! I went for a takeout, and I forgot a small bag of food. The guy actually called me back. You don't see that in many places. The place is also beautiful."

The best part was the food !!!! Delicious !!!! We really loved our plates
The service was not bas could be uplifted with a bit more of smiles
Prices were logical compared to a similar place
I will definitely visit it again to try more delicious food

I took the table d’hôte which included dessert and coffee. The appetizer and main course took a long time to arrive so I asked for the dessert and coffee to go. Instead, the manager comes to hand me the bag with the dessert and added that we shouldn’t take it to go nor can we take the coffee to go since they’re need to be consumed in the restaurant. I tell her that the main course was late and I’m out of time so that’s why asked for them to go. She adds : do you want to have your coffee now in the restaurant?! Obviously she’s didn’t get it! She could have just explained that they’re to be taken in the dining room and that she’ll make an exception if that’s such a big deal for them. At least, you gain a customer. But this time you lost a returning one."
Le Chalutier,Canadian (New),"1031 Boulevard des Laurentides Laval, QC H7G 2V8 Canada",QC,45.575267,-73.697093,5,"This restaurant was recently recommended to us. Here we were for the first time. Service was excellent after waiting only about five minutes to get in. They even have a shelter to wait in outside, if it's bad weather.
Once in we were served quickly. Menus is simple and straight forward, place under a glass table top.
Started with a glass of Sangria for both of us and an appetizer of Caesar Salad, which was enough for both of us, tasty and fresh.
We ordered their specialty, which was the Fish and Chips (Single Piece), which came with a quarter of lemon, Tartar Sauce, and a side of Cole Slaw, needless to say plenty of home made fries. No frozen food here.
Definitely good value for your money here."
Le Chalutier,Canadian (New),"1031 Boulevard des Laurentides Laval, QC H7G 2V8 Canada",QC,45.575267,-73.697093,5,"We’re on a mission to find the best fish and chip place around town. For context we are bench marking against the Fish Shack in Lunenburg NS which I consider a 10/10.  So far this does not disappoint with a strong 8.5 to 9 out of 10. The portions are large, but not greasy. Take the double, you won’t regret it. Since it was our first time, my partner took two and I took one… yes I stole 1/2 of his second ;) and absolutely will be taking the double next time.
The fries are standard size, home made and crispy. The cole slaw, on point!  Tartar sauce was sweeter than expected (still very good- not knocking it) and really enjoyed the dill sauce (not as sweet and very “dilly”).
We did not try the deserts, maybe next time.
Note the place doesn’t look like much, but don’t be put off by the location or aesthetics. The food is an epicurean’s dream.
Service was really good also, we were greeted and sat right away, namely because we went for lunch on a Saturday. They don’t take reservations, so if you’re going during peak hours there will most likely be a long wait… totally worth it.

FYI not much choice on the menu which IMHO is a good thing, didn’t see any veg options aside from soup and salad (but that’s not why we’re going there)."

My friend was right!!! Had the cream of cawliflower soup, fish n chip platter (fresh cut homemade French fries 😋) and ended my meal with an upsidown strawberry 🍓 cake. Hats 👒 off to the entire staff , the restaurant is extremely clean and inviting. Thank you, I will definitely be back soon."

I had the sliders and the spinach dip. The sliders were good, but I would have preferred it with some tomatoes and maybe a bit more cheese.
The spinach dip was delicious but the chips were just ordinary.

We loved the open balcony and tables in the bar where we could perch and watch the enlivening street life below, while the best music wooed us into a state of joy.  Bar Suzanne should be kept a secret so it can retain its fresh innocence but it’s a secret worth shouting from the rooftops.

This place was even better than what we imagined. The food, the people, the atmosphere is all amazing. A little more on the pricier side, though you're going for the experience of dining at a tavern filled with rustic decorations, captivating servers and charismatic bards.

I don't want to say too much so you can experience it on your own. Though it was our first time going, we're definitely coming back!

A knight was walking by regularly to talk to us (roleplaying). The barb was incredible. Took request song. It is an ambiance dinner. We were last service, so they asked for the attention of the room and told a story about a dragon. We then all share the blood of the dragon, and it waste ""worth it."" I think I'm becoming a dragon. Would recommend in a heartbeat for anyone who wants to have a medieval ambiance feast!"

The decor and staff really helped the medieval theme, transporting you back to a simpler time. Tasty and filling food all washed down with good ale (Boréale).

If you want to taste everything, I advise you to go in a group. The portions are huge and made to be shared. The only negative point is that the wait is long and it is not possible to make a reservation... There is not much space and the restaurant is too popular for its size. But it's worth it. I highly recommend it, the service is fast, the portions are generous and the price is reasonable."

Bonne appétit"
Le Professeur,Lebanese,"9735 Boulevard de l'Acadie Montreal, QC H4N 2W2 Canada",QC,45.5357659,-73.664576,2,"We came here for Sunday brunch.

There's no reservations and the place is very small, they give you a number and you wait until they call you. We waited for about 30 mins and we were seated.

The place is very small that the tables are all so close to each other, you can clearly hear other ppls conservation, it's very loud and there's also alot of families with kids

If you are looking to go somewhere quit to eat brunch this is not the place to go.

When you seat down they give you tea, the tea wasn't to my liking at all.
They don't offer glasses of water so we got bottle of water?

They also give you complimentary plate of olives, turnip, cucumber and tomatoes.

We ordered the spicy cheese and zahtaar sage, that was very good, I think it was my favorite. It was very big and came on a board.

We also got the professor lebneh, the tahini foul and the meat egg, they were okay nothing especially, the tahini foul was lemony, I felt like there was just too much lemon in there.

Will I go back I don't know, this is not a place you would go every week, it's a once a few months vibes"

I ordered the Tabouleh salad, whoch came in a good portion suitable fir 2 people, it was very fresh and tasty. As for the hot starter, I tried the pastrey plate and it was delicious For the main, I got the shish Tawook chicken, I’d say it was one of the best shish Tawooks I’ve ever had in my life. The chicken was very juicy and tender and it was well marinated. For the dessert, the knafe is a must have, I tried it with their black mint tea and it was delicious!

Garage Beirut,Lebanese,"1238 rue Mackay Montreal, QC H3G 2H4 Canada",QC,45.4951918,-73.5762322,5,Excellent authentic Lebanese food. A little on the pricier side but justified by being one of the top I've had in Montreal to date. The place is small but it's part of it's charm. The service was A1 with great attention to detail. I'd can't even recommend a dish as everything I tried was cooked to perfection. You should definitely reserve in advance if you want to dine in.
Garage Beirut,Lebanese,"1238 rue Mackay Montreal, QC H3G 2H4 Canada",QC,45.4951918,-73.5762322,4,Cute place with good food. We got the degustation trempette and the Shish Taouk. The hummus and baba ghannouj were our favourite while the muhammara wasn’t the best. The chicken in the Shish Taouk was nice and flavourful.
Kyoto,Japanese,"861 Boulevard Decarie Saint-Laurent, QC H4L 3L7 Canada",QC,45.5126288,-73.6794604,5,I highly recommend this place for special occasions. They are consistent in their preparation and the rolls always taste amazing. The way the rice is prepared is a key part of what makes sushi so delicious and Kyoto does it perfectly with just the right amount of vinegar/sugar. Combine that with their great fish and high quality ripe avocados = a real special treat :)

Plenty of people to make it feel right. We had the nachos, calamari, burgers, shrimp, ribs, steak and a slice of cake. Everything was on point, cooked well and very tasty...but the calamari was small, tough and tasteless. The service was polite and attentive."

Okay the drinks were also great and the bartender was incredibly friendly and helpful. It was a kind of eclectic mixing of foods, but everything tasted good (except maybe the ceviche—it wasn’t bad but it wasn’t what I expected as ceviche: it was kind of like guacamole with some fish in it)."

Meant more for groups willing to share plates vs individual orders. More variety in the appetizers than the éntrees. Definitely a pricier restaurant for the portions, but the quality is high.

We had a meeting first  they organized that we can meet in a private room with water and coffee service. After the meeting, we went out of the room. We had our table already prepared. Food and service are excellent.  The best was the falafel plate. A place to recommend"
Madisons,American (Traditional),"1695 Boulevard de l'Avenir Laval, QC H7S 2N5 Canada",QC,45.5668085,-73.7278201,5,Love this restaurant. The staff is amazing and so is the food. Nice portions and a beautiful atmosphere. They have a private upstairs area that seat 30-55 ppl. I always feel like I’m with family when I eat here. The BEST IN MONTREAL & LAVAL surrounding area.. A MUST
Madisons,American (Traditional),"1695 Boulevard de l'Avenir Laval, QC H7S 2N5 Canada",QC,45.5668085,-73.7278201,3,"This was my first time here and I came with a big group for a birthday so that could affect my experience but if i had to describe it, it wasn't good but wasn't bad either.

The food was okay, we had nachos and calamari that we shared for appetizers and for my main meal i had the filet mignon with peppercorn sauce accompanied with salmon tartare, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
-The nachos were good.
-The calamari was good but everyone that had some felt sick by the end of the night.
-The filet mignon was ok not a lot of flavor and even with the peppercorn sauce it was still ok.
-The salmon tartare was good and fresh, maybe a little more seasoning but overall I'd have it again.
-The mashed potatoes were a little bland to my taste but was good with the peppercorn sauce.

For the service, they had multiple big groups that night so it could effect this but for our group we were over 20 and had only one server. They never came to check for water or that everyone had, only at the end did we get more after asking, we had drinks (the drinks were good) in the beginning as well but they never came back to ask if we wanted more. I never had a set of utensils and had to grab from another table (this could be a mix up with a big group). The server was nice and handled multiple groups hence why I can't blame her but they could have added more servers, she had two big groups in all that so of course some things will be missing.

Overall the experience was ok, i don't know if I'd go back.
I've attached some photos of my meal and drinks we had."

When Madison says that service is a priority, they really seem to mean it and it is reflected in the attitude of every employee in the restaurant. Special praises for our server Giovanni, his service blew me away. From his initial greeting to the moment we left, his service was well above 5 stars. Simply put, if I ran a restaurant, I would have offered him a management position right on the spot. Thank you for a great experience!"

I was like, okay. Why not, as long as I see no blood on my plate 🤦🏽‍♂️🤣. So the waiter came through and it was time to order.

Despite all the sarcasm on the table, she managed to understand my picky request. She even went as far as saying that her grandmother loves it just like that too lol.

Long story short, I really enjoyed my meal. Big shoutout to the waiters who made our stay a fabulous one tonight 😉."

Inside has more a bar/supper club vibe. Music was nice but at certain times super loud. Will definitely try to sit outside next time.
Food:
We ordered two appetizers the cheese platter and gnocchi. Both were good, good size and nice presentation
For the main, we ordered the ravioli with lobster and mushrooms. Really good. A bit on the salty side but loved it.
The grilled octopus was also delicious
Dessert:
We just had the churros as the creme brûlée had whiskey in it and thought it could be sour.
Overall nice experience and will definitely come back"

The oysters were so fresh and massive, we ordered multiple different plates and everything was good. The waitress was very friendly and our drinks were always kept full. I am removing a star because there were a lot of young staff standing by the kitchen hugging and touching each other and it was so unprofessional to have that right by our table all night."

They were mainly good, drinks r good but a little expensive.  Food was perfect, price is with the market but service was not there..
no one came back to ask if it was ok. The two staffs were probably new, and they were always talking in the corner.

The good food kept the restaurant at 4/5 stars."

Having been there more than a dozen times over the last few years, July 2023 we jad the gnocchis which were utterly dissapointing, cocktails were watery... first time dissapointed at le Boating.

They need to have more bars in this place. You're gonna wait over 5 mins (sounds like nothing until you're actually waiting) just to get a drink.

And the drinks aren't consistent. They're stronger towards the end of the night. Probably their way of getting people out faster."
Saint Sushi Plateau,Sushi Bars,"424 Avenue Duluth E Montreal, QC H2L 1A3 Canada",QC,45.5211176,-73.5753568,5,"This is one restaurant we always visit every time we are in Montreal. The staff are always very friendly and helpful. One employee even recognized us although it’s been four years since we were there last time.

Their sushi is not the traditional type, which is why they call it fusion sushi. But their food, from sushi, maki to sashimi, it is always fresh. We have never had any bad experiences. Their prices are a bit higher now. For the service we received and the great quality food they prepared, it was still worth it in my opinion."

The table also ordered the small sashimi plate, the nigiri plate, and a Madonna roll. All of the fish was fresh and everything tasted good. But I didn’t love that our server was not confident in which fish came on the sashimi and nigiri plates when we asked what they were. Service overall was not great, but I did love the atmosphere and playlist."

We ended up on a special anniversary night and the menu was spectacular.  Wasn’t the quickest but, that is fine since the food was amazing. The Salmon appetizer and the Salmon entree were cooked to perfection. The goat was equally good and i had no idea you could add maple syrup as a sauce to goat. This restaurant was one of the highlights to my trip to Montreal.  The only downside was the salad and the cocktail (Mombassa) wasn’t of the same standard as the other food. However Id still drink that again too. Can’t wait for my next Montreal trip to revisit this place."
Yokato Yokabai,Ramen,"4185 Rue Drolet Montreal, QC H2W 2L5 Canada",QC,45.5211845,-73.5785612,4,"Cute spot for ramen. The food was a little overpriced but all in all a good experience. I loved being able to choose the saltiness level of the dish. Also the service was great. They do not take reservations and there’s only a small seating area so I would make sure to go on a weekday or early on a weekend. The chicken soup base was delicious and I wish I tried the thicker noodles. All in all, a great dining experience."

And they gave us a complimentary drink due their renovation. The broth was well seasoned and creamy, the tokontsu was delicious which is the most special dish. The sides like the takoyaki were normal and tasted like any other."
Yokato Yokabai,Ramen,"4185 Rue Drolet Montreal, QC H2W 2L5 Canada",QC,45.5211845,-73.5785612,5,"Insane ramen which fully exceeded all expectations I had based on the hype of this place. Well worth the wait, but suggest going for lunch to beat the crowds. I haven’t had ramen this good since a salaryman-filled hole in the wall in Kyoto. The broth is so incredibly flavoured, the noodles are absolute perfection and even the pork in the ramen was marinated with some sort of sweetness. The croquettes are to die for (we ate them so quickly I totally forgot to take a photo) and the karaage was phenomenal with some of the best sauce I’ve ever seen paired with it (photo is one piece less than what arrived as we couldn’t help ourselves from tasting). The food is absolutely a 100/10 and can’t wait to go back to try to other menu items. Note that the ramen side is currently closed for renovations, so we ate on the other side. The service was a bit all over the place (eg. got our beers after our first appetiser was out) but still recommend this place nonetheless. If you’re going to eat ramen anywhere in Montreal and want a true Japanese dish, make sure to stop in here."
Yokato Yokabai,Ramen,"4185 Rue Drolet Montreal, QC H2W 2L5 Canada",QC,45.5211845,-73.5785612,4,I went a Monday evening and it was quite busy as we had to add ourselves to their virtual waiting list. The place was very packed as we were going to have to wait over an hour to sit. We ended up sitting at the bar area instead. The place is a little small and there was not that much room overall . The guy at the bar was very friendly and gave us a good service. The ramen was good quality and you can customize it with the order sheet. They are generous with the meat portion and their chicken teriyaki was very good. They also have many interesting options excluding the ramens . They also give extra dressings on the side for the ramens which was a nice feature as well . Their cocktails were good and they have many unique options.
Yokato Yokabai,Ramen,"4185 Rue Drolet Montreal, QC H2W 2L5 Canada",QC,45.5211845,-73.5785612,5,"The ramen is always good. Our service was quite slow and the server got our order mixed up. But they apologized and gaved us free dessert. Overall, it is a nice restaurant with caring servers."
Les Cavistes,French,"196 Rue Fleury O Montreal, QC H3L 1T5 Canada",QC,45.5457862,-73.666207,4,"Retro looking bistro inclining towards a classic fine restaurant. A bit pricey though. It is worth visiting once or twice, but that's it unfortunately. Their food is ok-ish. I give, a rare for me, four stars to Les Cavistes simply the kitchen's saucier made a much better job then the chef who grilled my cheap-cut steak. In fact, the sauce was notice-worthy I should admit. I cannot say the same for their pasta, which lacked the essence of oily-spicy-aromatic textural balance. If not the sauce, what's in pasta??? The apperatifs tray was aesthetically pleasing yet harbored ridiculously small quantities. I simply was not impressed by it. During covid-19, they let you scan a q_code and the menu miracalously appears on your phone, if you will be moved by the action. Overall, I recommend this restaurant for the uninitiated to give it a try."

I have to admit I see what all the hype is behind @sangennaromtl. It's been around for years and I finally made it there! A great little spot located in the heart of little Italy serving up some great pizza and coffee for the neighbourhood.
.
Being my first time there and not knowing when I would have the time to go back, I naturally got the lot! I got every slice and style they had that day and each was delicious. I feel I'd have to say my favorite was the Margherita. Something about a classic style pizza just does it for me. The dough is fantastic, the crust is crunchy and each bite has a little something on it!

San Gennaro,Pizza,"69 Rue Saint-Zotique Est Montreal, QC H2S 1K7 Canada",QC,45.5328169,-73.6112888,4,"Great Roman style pizza for sure. Crust is good and the potato and tropea pizzas are delicious. I’ve had slightly better crust for this kind of pizza elsewhere, but it’s still good.

Drinks are also very strong, so they’re not cheap on the booze. Limited seating with outdoor stand up style tables."

Le Petit Italien,Italian,"1265 Rue Bernard O Outremont, QC H2V 1V8 Canada",QC,45.5197383,-73.6092604,4,"A great place for pasta. They do have good variety of pasta on the menu. They even offered non gluten pasta.
The decoration of the restaurant is very cute and cozy. It's a great place for family, friends or a date (about 50 places seated).
Overall the food and cocktails that we ordered were good. The cocktails could be a little bit more elaborated.
If you are a fanatic of pasta, I highly recommend this place."
Le Petit Italien,Italian,"1265 Rue Bernard O Outremont, QC H2V 1V8 Canada",QC,45.5197383,-73.6092604,2,"Food quality is very average.
Price versus portions is terrible. Portions are so small. Menu is way overpriced. Service is very ordinary.
You feel cheated when you have this restaurant because they charge way too much versus what you receive in your plate. I would be embarrassed to serve those portions."

It’s really hard to not get a Cesar salad right but this Cesar salad was extremely bland, little to no dressing. The focaccia…. Well they call it focaccia but it was a poorly baked piece of bread that had the texture of uncooked bread but the taste of burnt bread, i’m not sure how they did that… and the meatballs, they were okay, the sauce tasted like some sort of canned pre-made sauce. If you don’t know authentic Italian food then you should be fine."

They told us we had 1.5 hours to eat and then leave, which I find was strange. We accepted as we were sure they would not kick us out if we stayed 1/2 hour more (dont want to choke on steak). We waited 20 minutes for our meal. My friend ordered the New york steak and it was fatty and rubbery. I wanted a rib steak but they did not have. They provide you with little fries and then they come back to see if you want more. They charge 50cents for tiny bread which is ridiculous. Service was poor as waiter hardly came by to verify if all was ok. Ambiance was not great. We would not return back."

However the server was very pushy, the lamb was dry and when my wife asked her why is it so dry she said that’s how it’s supposed to be, at the same time my friend lamb was juicy. Our bill was 400$. I would not go back due to service. They 0.5$ per bread. I would not go back."

The atmosphere was nice. I ordered la table d'hôte, in which I had snails with garlic and cheese, New York Steak with a lobster tail and cupcake trio. The snails and the lobster tail were delicious. The steak was good too, but I ordered it medium and it came medium-well. The fries lacked seasoning and were bland. The trio cupcake was good. Overall, the food is delicious and I had a great experience."
Le Steak Frites St-Paul,Steakhouses,"2125 Boulevard le Carrefour Boul Laval, QC H7S 2J7 Canada",QC,45.5719704,-73.7427076,4,"French fries are all you can eat here with mayo and ketchup, always freshly made. The lamb sharnk is tender, but served without a sauce. The St Paul steak is tender but the chef failed to produce the medium rare as ordered. The Terre et Mer is very good, both the lobster tail and well done filet mignon. All vegetables came with the main are excellent roasted. The calamari is good but the size of squid is too small for making the dish.
It was an enjoyable evening, will come back next time and bring a bottle of wine."
Restaurant Calvi,Italian,"2940 Ave Pierre-Péladeau Laval, QC H7T 3B3 Canada",QC,45.56312,-73.744751,2,"This place is okay, but it's not authentic.

The octopus was really good, but very small portion.
The calamari was okay, nothing special, there was no tentacles.

The truffle pasta was okay also and the risotto dish came with a big piece of Osso bucco, was not expecting to have a big piece of Osso bucco, I thought it would be bone off.

But I can say that the creme brulee was really good

The service was actually amazing, the waiter was really friendly.

I had ordered an espresso martini with my dessert but they had forgotten to put khalua in it and it taste horrible, when I told the waiter about it he was doubting me on why I wanted to return the drink back but then he realized that it was the khalua that was missing in the drink, he brought me khalua in a glass so I can mix it in my drink.

This place seemed to be more of a place for groups, they had private rooms. If you are celebrating a birthday party or a big get together in Laval with Italian type of food, I think it's a good choice."
Restaurant Calvi,Italian,"2940 Ave Pierre-Péladeau Laval, QC H7T 3B3 Canada",QC,45.56312,-73.744751,1,"Went on a weekday evening, hardly anyone there but yet the service was lacking.   Caesar salad was made with green lettuce instead of romaine.  Became very soggy. Plates did not look nice.   Steak was very hard to chew.  Where was the veggies in the shrimp and veggies dish? Cold and tough shrimp.  And the ravioli was just ok.    I expected so much more from this restaurant. I was not impressed at all. Did not finish plates.  Sprinkling tomatoes does not make a plate look nice.."
Restaurant Calvi,Italian,"2940 Ave Pierre-Péladeau Laval, QC H7T 3B3 Canada",QC,45.56312,-73.744751,2,"The service was pretty bad.

Restaurant Calvi,Italian,"2940 Ave Pierre-Péladeau Laval, QC H7T 3B3 Canada",QC,45.56312,-73.744751,3,"Great service (!!) but the food and ambiance here are absolutely nothing to write home about. The food was mediocre and as such acceptable, but the overall experience feels tired and dated. I understand that not every place wants to be trendy, but Calvi lacks a sense of pride."
Restaurant Calvi,Italian,"2940 Ave Pierre-Péladeau Laval, QC H7T 3B3 Canada",QC,45.56312,-73.744751,1,"Just Avoid this place. The restaurant was empty, The manager name Adil welcomed us. However, he didn’t seems to happy, since we were with 2 kids. Therefore, he gave us a table in an isolated room, where it was very hot. As soon as we wanted to sit, he even closed the door.  It was 42 degrees Celsius outside. I asked him “is the air conditioning working in that room, he told me yes”. Which was not true. Therefore we decided to leave and we came to Sterling Steakhouse right next door. They were very nice and accommodating and helpful with the kids. Mr. Adil I hope you have kids and if you do, I hope no one’s treats you like how you treated us."

The egg and tofu dumplings were among my favourite (even compared to meat ones). The beef and coriander were also very good.
Pork and cabbage were my least favourite.

Great for vegetarians!"

My friends and I wanted to make sure we were emotionally and spiritually ready for our movie adventure so we fuelled our bodies with dumplings. As is tradition we all split our different types of dumplings so we got to sample the lamb/coriander, chicken/mushroom, and beef/coriander varieties. Wow is this place good. The sweetness of the ginger ale was made sweater when the waiter complimented our Barbie outfits. I am a Barbie girl, sampler of dumpling worlds. Great place, highly recommend."

Antep Kabab,Turkish,"1626 Boulevard de Maisonneuve O Montreal, QC H3H 2N4 Canada",QC,45.4952139,-73.5795416,5,"Nestled in the heart of the city, Antep Kebab is a true gem for lovers of Turkish cuisine. From the moment you step through the door, you're greeted with warm hospitality and the enticing aromas of perfectly seasoned meats grilling on open flames. However, what sets Antep Kebab apart from other Turkish restaurants is its exceptional homemade bread and mouthwatering dressings that elevate the dining experience to new heights.

The star of the show at Antep Kebab is undoubtedly their freshly baked bread. With each bite, you can taste the care and craftsmanship that goes into its preparation. The bread is soft, yet slightly crispy on the outside, creating the perfect vessel for savoring the tantalizing flavors of their kebabs. The bread is served warm, allowing it to melt in your mouth and complement the grilled meats impeccably. It's evident that Antep Kebab takes great pride in their bread-making tradition, and it shines through in every delightful bite.

The assortment of dressings at Antep Kebab is a true delight for the taste buds. Each dressing is thoughtfully crafted and perfectly balanced, enhancing the flavors of the kebabs without overpowering them. Whether you prefer the tanginess of the yogurt-based tzatziki or the rich smokiness of the roasted red pepper sauce, there is a dressing to suit every palate. The attention to detail and quality of the dressings truly add depth and complexity to the entire dining experience.

Beyond the bread and dressings, Antep Kebab offers a wide selection of kebabs, each prepared with the utmost care and using authentic Turkish spices. The meats are tender and succulent, showcasing the expertise of the chefs and their commitment to serving top-quality dishes. The menu also includes an array of vegetarian options, ensuring that everyone can find something to savor and enjoy."

Where do I even begin? First off, we were here thanks to a giveaway that I had initial won through a certain platform. Entrée, main meal and dessert was on the house for two.

From the moment we entered the restaurant, we were greated right away. They already knew why we were there. Which was great! I didn't have to explain myself and show proof and have to go through a long series of waiting for an authorisation from the owner. The staffs were all well informed about everything!

We were seated right away. They took the time to explain the menu and informed us about the specials of the evening. Our waitress/hostess was a little cold by mid meal. Meaning, she did not took a moment to ask if everything was to our liking. While on the other hand, a table next to us, were regular costumers and I will say, they were treated first-class! Mind you, we ordered extra items (two cocktails) and tip was given according to our entire meal including the extra items.

Despite that little hiccup, our dinner experince at Bistro Nolah was by far the best we have ever had in a very long time.

I have always wanted to try Southern dishes without having to travel too far and let me tell you, the food was mouth-watering. It was an explosion of flavors! The details on each plating was immaculate.

The whole experince was so memorable that we came back a second time, not long after!

Mr. Chef Taitt, you have an amazing team with such talent and your restaurant reflects that. Thank you for 2 unforgetable dinners!"

Tapas are great, a few to choose from, some tastier than others. Overall a good and tasty experience. Service is on point, charming waiter and waitresses add to the experience. I will come back again to try out more of the menu."

Maria Bonita,Mexican,"5163 Boulevard Saint-Laurent Montreal, QC H2T 1R9 Canada",QC,45.5236601,-73.5938796,5,I came across this lovely authentic mexican restaurant in Montreal while on a stop over before heading to Quebec City with my husband and daughter. The food was great and taste really good. Cozy ambiance and great service.  Definitely a must try.
Maria Bonita,Mexican,"5163 Boulevard Saint-Laurent Montreal, QC H2T 1R9 Canada",QC,45.5236601,-73.5938796,4,This was our second visit to this colorfully decorated Mexican restaurant. It was a warm evening so we took advantage of the warm weather to eat on their curb side terrace. The service was prompt & the waiter explained the concept of the tapas style menu with cazuelitas. You make your own tacos. The Margaritas were good & accompanied with tasty nachos & guacamole. Our appetizer of cheese quesadilla however lacked a little flavor. The tacos came in a pretty little bowl with towel that kept them warm. You order your own fillings for the cazuelitas. There are 2 extra sauces that you can add a mild one & an extremely hot one that my wife who  likes spicey foods even found too hot. We ordered 3 cazuelitas which I found underwhelming. I would have liked the opportunity to order some rice or refried beans as a side but they are not on the menu. The presentation & service were very good however overall the food lacked the wow factor for us.
Maria Bonita,Mexican,"5163 Boulevard Saint-Laurent Montreal, QC H2T 1R9 Canada",QC,45.5236601,-73.5938796,5,"Could not be more impressed honestly! The service was amazing, the food & drink was perfect. Wasn't even troubled by the delay on the food but they still went above and beyond with extra chips and churros on the house. I'd give this place 6 stars if I could just for that!"
Le Colonel Moutarde,Canadian (New),"4418 Rue Saint-Denis Montreal, QC H2J 2L1 Canada",QC,45.5233065,-73.581856,5,"Pros:
-Nice place to play board games with friends. They have a good variety of games (even though not as much as other board games places in Montreal).
-For 5$, you have access to all of the games available, and ask questions to one of the employees that will help you pick a game depending on your mood
-The tempeh salad tasted great, I loved it and wasn't expensive.
-The mocktails are original, and delicious"
Le Colonel Moutarde,Canadian (New),"4418 Rue Saint-Denis Montreal, QC H2J 2L1 Canada",QC,45.5233065,-73.581856,5,"Always a great place to have fun with friends while playing boardgames. Great ambiance, the food and service are both great.
Personally I like it better than Randolph.
The only thing is you cannot reserve a table but it does give a fair chance for everyone to get a table."
Le Colonel Moutarde,Canadian (New),"4418 Rue Saint-Denis Montreal, QC H2J 2L1 Canada",QC,45.5233065,-73.581856,4,"Very nice and happening place . Everyone was so fun and the food was good too. They had a trivia night but we were late for it. They do have plenty of board games. This is the right place to chill out with your friends.

The waitress speak English and being non French speaking, we didn't have problem communicating.

They did have vegetarian pizza option , which was good."
Le Colonel Moutarde,Canadian (New),"4418 Rue Saint-Denis Montreal, QC H2J 2L1 Canada",QC,45.5233065,-73.581856,5,"Cocktails are delicious: me and my 2 other friends ordered three to four of them each!! Can't say anything about the food as we had already eaten before coming.

We came on a Friday around 9PM and had to wait in line for about 15 minutes: we were seated at the bar at first and then moved to a table when one freed up!

We had a great time and would totally come back again. Also, their bathrooms are very clean!"
Le Colonel Moutarde,Canadian (New),"4418 Rue Saint-Denis Montreal, QC H2J 2L1 Canada",QC,45.5233065,-73.581856,5,"Excellent concept.  Great way to spend an evening and satisfy your inner gamer.
Huge selection of games for all.  From quick two player party games to the longer drawn out strategy games.
The game concierge are extremely knowledgeable, approachable and friendly.  The food and drink selection was surprisingly good.  The staff was warm and often checked in.
Highly recommended for a evening with friends or even just a 2 person outing."

Amazing food, Amazing service.  Absolutely unbelievably kind and generous owner.  This is THE place to go for a burger. Worth driving here.

Yes, it could be a little slow to get order, but it's only because the patty is thick and they make it all fresh!  Well worth the wait.  If you're in a rush, then call ahead of time !  I've done that before."
Burger de Ville,Burgers,"7093 Jarry E Montreal, QC H1J 1G3 Canada",QC,45.6015782,-73.5762965,5,"Amazing burgers and steak! Honestly is there a better burger joint in the city than this place? Inexpensive, especially for the quality you are getting. Most burgers will top out around $7-8, and the portions are big. For most common burgers they're cheaper than the fast food restaurant chains, but much better quality. Quality is also way above some of the ""trendy"" hamburger restaurants that have opened recently; they are substantially cheaper than them. Had a 12oz steak (New York strip) with a side for $18.95 (pic below) ; very inexpensive for the quality of the steak they make, and it's fresh (due to this the price is variable)."

The pasta was delicious (the texture was great). There is a vegetarian option as well. The restaurant offers take-out lasagna, as well as a few tables for eating in. The staff (owner?) were friendly and helpful! This is a place I highly recommend."
Lasagne Du Plateau,Italian,"5007, Avenue Du Parc Montreal, QC H2V 4E9 Canada",QC,45.519349,-73.5946623,5,This is the best place in Montreal to have lasagna! You can certainly dine in but I think most of the business is a takeout business. I stop in once or twice a week to get my lasagna fix. I'd go more often but this restaurant is only open Wednesday Saturday. The owner has his own recipes and handles everything himself. I'm wildly pleased with each type of lasagna he makes. Definitely recommend him to anyone who loves lasagna the way that I do.
Lasagne Du Plateau,Italian,"5007, Avenue Du Parc Montreal, QC H2V 4E9 Canada",QC,45.519349,-73.5946623,5,"Really good lasagna. The pasta was especially nice, great consistency.

Lasagne Du Plateau,Italian,"5007, Avenue Du Parc Montreal, QC H2V 4E9 Canada",QC,45.519349,-73.5946623,5,"LDP lasagna is on point! If you like good marinara sauce and homemade pasta, LDP never disappoints. Excellent for parties, chalet events or when you are hosting an event and you do not want to do hours and hours of work but want your guests to be satisfied and impressed with the food. Vegetarian options available, our favourite is the vegetarian lasagna and eggplant parm (seasonal)! Whether you order a tray or a single portion, you can expect the same quality. LDP does not skip out. We have ordered from LDP for lunches of +20 people for work (pre-covid), chalet outings (10+ guests) or just grabbed lunch, every time LDP has delivered and have our friends going back on their own for more. A great plus, the owner is a great human and cares about his customers!
Pro tip - Call them order ahead because they sell out often."

straight up, Super cool place, Super cool guy,  Bruno, Reminds me as if we we’re in a Bronx tale ;). He made us 2 lasagna’s/Beef sauce and one Ravioli.
It was amazing! Texture of lasagna was immaculate, tomato sauce wasn’t acidic, but perfect, like what you make at home, cheese, enough to melt in your mouth and finally, temperature, to perfection, enough for you to enjoy your meal. We we’re 3 people and every bite we were giving each other eye contact and agreeing to ultimate satisfaction. If you don’t like your meal, message me and I’ll pay it, that’s how much I trust this place.
So lady’s and gentlemen, enjoy!

The ambiance and service were fantastic, and the staff, were all dudes dressed in shorts and t-shirts, giving a relaxed and welcoming vibe.

The chicken satay was absolutely amazing, the other dishes and cocktails were good as well. I highly recommend this place."
Satay Brothers,Singaporean,"138 Avenue Atwater Montreal, QC H4C 2H6 Canada",QC,45.4796547,-73.5770991,4,"Amazing place. Great staff and ambiance. Music is a bit too loud but very good. Everything was delicious. Papaya salad and pork buns are a must.

Highly recommend to share the plates. We shared 5 plates and the desert plate for 3 people and it cost us under 40$ before tax and tip.

Place gets packed everyday, reco to get there before 7:30-8pm."
Satay Brothers,Singaporean,"138 Avenue Atwater Montreal, QC H4C 2H6 Canada",QC,45.4796547,-73.5770991,2,"The music was extremely loud when we visited. Impossible to make any conversation even with the person sitting next to you. Food was alright, would have enjoyed it better if we could've talked to each other.
We made a reservation for 11 people and one person didn't show up. They split the 11th person's charge evenly over our bills; even though they only brought food for the 10 of us.

Unfortunately, I would not go again."
Satay Brothers,Singaporean,"138 Avenue Atwater Montreal, QC H4C 2H6 Canada",QC,45.4796547,-73.5770991,4,A must for those who love Asian food but crave something different from the traditional flavors found in Chinatown. I suggest coming as a group and ordering many dishes to share. The umami is through the roof and can feel heavy if not paired with white rice. My personal favorites are the pork belly steamed buns and the laksa.
Satay Brothers,Singaporean,"138 Avenue Atwater Montreal, QC H4C 2H6 Canada",QC,45.4796547,-73.5770991,5,"No resos for groups under 6, and I recommend getting there early. We arrived at 6:30pm on a Thursday and it was packed, we waited roughly 15-20 minutes for a spot for 2. They let you order drinks while waiting though, which is a great start.

Must try’s on the menu are the satay skewers with peanut sauce, the fried pork and shrimp rice rolls (not pictured, but we both agreed it was the best thing we tasted!), papaya salad, and the regular pork steam buns.

The shrimp buns were part of their specials, but it’s not as balanced and tasty as the pork buns. If you’re stuck between the two, go pork.

For the noodles, I would go for the mussel and chorizo noodles instead of the shrimp and cuttlefish.

But really, everything on the menu is excellent. We also have our amazing experience to thank to our server Carl, who went above and beyond in the service.

100% recommend!"
Chez Gerard,Fast Food,"46 Boulevard Cartier O Laval, QC H7N 2H4 Canada",QC,45.5593894,-73.6884802,1,"I get it that it's a fast food place but don't offer a salad if you're not going to wash it first. I paid over 11$ for a Caesar salad (no extras). The lettuce was dirty and to top it off- a blue collar worker with very dirty hands helped himself to the croutons behind the counter.  I guess he's a regular customer so they don't bother him. He reached into the jar of croutons, took out a handful - put his grubby hands to his mouth and then reached in a couple more times.  These are the very same croutons that were on my salad!  Ewwwww!"

I'm traveller and this is first time I tried meat and chicken cooked one day before..
Not healthy atmosphere..use to be good before.

The owner very rude and he treated customers base on their background

Won't recommend it"
Boucherie Abu Elias,Middle Eastern,"733 Boulevard de La Cote-Vertu Saint-Laurent, QC H4L 1Y3 Canada",QC,45.521061,-73.6742542,1,"So disappointed by Abu Elias. Clear sign that Anthony cant be trusted anymore as a reliable source. Got the marinated chicken legs, raw meat and ribs.

The bad: chicken thighs sadly had to be thrown out the next day. It was old and smelly. For the price tbh i was expecting fresh chicken. For it to spoil within a day isnt a sign of fresh chicken. It was stored along with the ribs which were amazing, so definitely not a fridge issue on my end.
The raw meat was not handled according to Canadian guidance for handling raw meat which was a major disappointment given that they make “kebbe nayeh”.
The ribs were delicious so no issue there.
Prices are really inflated and doesn’t justify the quality."
Boucherie Abu Elias,Middle Eastern,"733 Boulevard de La Cote-Vertu Saint-Laurent, QC H4L 1Y3 Canada",QC,45.521061,-73.6742542,1,"Review of Abou Elias Restaurant:

I recently had the opportunity to visit Abou Elias Restaurant, and unfortunately, I left with a rather disappointing experience. While I had heard positive things about their sandwiches and service, my personal encounter was far from satisfying.

One of the first things I noticed was the size of the sandwiches. They were incredibly tiny, which left me feeling a bit short-changed. It seemed like there was barely any filling, making the overall taste and satisfaction quite underwhelming.

To make matters worse, the meat in the sandwiches was extremely chewy. It felt like it had been overcooked or lacked tenderness. This greatly affected the overall enjoyment of the meal, as I had expected a better quality of meat.

Moreover, the service I received when requesting a bit of garlic sauce on the side was quite disappointing. The employee seemed irritated by the request and proceeded to lecture us about their policy of not providing additional condiments. Their attitude was unprofessional and left a negative impression. It is disheartening when a customer's reasonable request is met with such hostility.

The most disappointing aspect was the stark contrast between the restaurant's online presence and the actual experience. While they may portray themselves as generous and offering amazing service on various YouTube channels, the reality was far from it. It felt as if they were merely pretending to provide exceptional service for the sake of online appearances.

Overall, my visit to Abou Elias Restaurant was far from satisfactory. The sandwiches were tiny, the meat was chewy, and the service was below par. I would advise potential customers to approach this establishment with caution, as the actual experience may not align with the advertised image."
Boucherie Abu Elias,Middle Eastern,"733 Boulevard de La Cote-Vertu Saint-Laurent, QC H4L 1Y3 Canada",QC,45.521061,-73.6742542,5,"Delicious food, tastes just like in Lebanon. I can't believe I've waited all this time to discover this place.

Treat yourself and go the mixed meat platter. I see some comments here saying it's overpriced, it's just not. This is MUCH better than what you can get from the big Lebanese food chains, it's incomparable. The meat is flavorful, fresh, juicy. It comes with all the right fixings. Their potatoes are d delicious too.

Also, please give a try to their hummus. This is what real hummus should taste like. This is the only place I've tried  that serve a proper hummus in Montreal (and trust me, I've tried many Lebanese restaurants on the island and in Laval for the past 10+ years). This would be considered a good hummus even in Lebanon. It is creamy, and you can really taste the tahini.

Ordered through doordash and it arrived quickly and well packaged."
Boucherie Abu Elias,Middle Eastern,"733 Boulevard de La Cote-Vertu Saint-Laurent, QC H4L 1Y3 Canada",QC,45.521061,-73.6742542,4,"The food was excellent. We ordered the mixed tray to dine in. However, there were no forks or knives. Just if you ask, they will give you. They also don't accept credit cards."
Ottavio,Italian,"1459 Boulevard Saint-Martin O Laval, QC H7S 1N1 Canada",QC,45.5703094,-73.7245277,3,"I really enjoyed their large variety of options in their menu which caters to a lot of people with different types of food restrictions. It allowed a large group like ours to all find something that we like easily. The food here was decent, the prices are a bit higher than a lot of other Italian restaurants but the quality is a bit better I would say. The portions are also reasonable for the prices. The service was split in two, one waitress was nice and friendly, being very careful about allergies and food restrictions while another waitress was a bit more less friendly. In my opinion, everything was decent and a bit above average, overall a decent place to enjoy a meal with a larger group."

Ice cream is also all-you-can-eat!! :)"
K-BBQ,Korean,"4337 Boulevard Saint-Jean Dollard-des-Ormeaux, QC H9H 2A4 Canada",QC,45.4814885,-73.8428624,3,"The restaurant is small and has no ventilation so it was very smokey.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  They changed the grills often to reduce the amount of smoke but it didn't make much difference.

The food was decent but nothing special.  Some of the meat was tender and some was chewy.  The shrimp were tasty but not very big.  The best thing that we ate was the spicy fried chicken.  It was crisp, flavourful and juicy.  It would have been nice to have more dipping sauces for the largely unflavoured meats.  The kimchi was also very nice and not overly spicy.

The restaurant is fun since you grill your own food to the doneness that you prefer but once the novelty wears off, you realize that you are paying to cook your own meal in a restaurant.

My main concerns was more of a food safety issue.  You are given tongs to grill the raw meat but you use the same tongs to serve the cooked meat and the side dishes thereby contaminating everything.  I'm not usually a stickler about these things but in this case you are cooking many different pieces of meat at many different stages of doneness and everything is contaminated."
K-BBQ,Korean,"4337 Boulevard Saint-Jean Dollard-des-Ormeaux, QC H9H 2A4 Canada",QC,45.4814885,-73.8428624,2,"it's sad for me to say but this was the worst dining experience i had in years. food was okay but nothing special.

i recommand the marinated chicken and the spicy chicken legs. also their seafood on the grill was decent.

unfortunately, this place is understaffed,no ventilation and they give you 2h max even though the place was slow. me and my colleagues were inhaling gas and charred meat smoke the entire time. i felt sick to my stomach and had a headache until the next morning... sorry guys but am not coming back.

We got the nacho dumplings (highly recommend it) & mango salad as an entree. Then they served us the ribs which were to die for. Then we had the tacos - my favorite was the fish (Baja 2.0). And finally churros for dessert! Overall the meals were very well balanced and we were super full by the end.

We had the Margarita Media Noche & a classical one.

Would definitely go there again"
Escondite,Mexican,"2119 Boulevard le Carrefour Laval, QC H7S 1Z4 Canada",QC,45.5721677,-73.7423496,5,"Second time here - small, very cute and trendy place. Atmosphere is fun (cute signs hanging on the walls - see pictures) albeit a little loud for conversation. The food was excellent (melt-in-your-month good) and very flavourful. I had the mango salad (wow) and my husband had the chips ‘n guac and we had 2 tacos each - it was plenty. The tacos are quite small but with an appetizer, sufficient. I would definitely recommend for a fun night with friends!"
Escondite,Mexican,"2119 Boulevard le Carrefour Laval, QC H7S 1Z4 Canada",QC,45.5721677,-73.7423496,4,"Friendly staff, fast service. A bit pricey but don’t expect to be full. It’s mini size snack. We enjoy our night but was still hungry after. This mexicain restaurant is more of a chill and hang out for drink kinda place. Beautiful decorations and the male & female bathroom are kool."
Escondite,Mexican,"2119 Boulevard le Carrefour Laval, QC H7S 1Z4 Canada",QC,45.5721677,-73.7423496,5,"When I took my first bite of their nachos, I saw the holy light. I was surrounded by angels. I could hear the trumpets. My life flashed before my eyes. I witnessed every moment that led me up to that very moment. When I snapped back to reality, those nachos had already made sweet SWEET love to me twice. AND tHAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING. Their tacos. I did not think these flavors were even possible. I was killed beautifully and reborn and baptized gracefully by their tacos. It was a moment like never before. This is what love feels like. And that love was found here, at Escondite, behind a bar, being served by an angel of a bartender. I wanted to spend the rest of my life and grow old with this meal. I wanted to be buried beside this meal. The only thing I could ever complain about this place is that I cannot stay there all day."
20Ten City Eatery,Desserts,"2010 12th Avenue Regina, SK S4P 2B8 Canada",SK,50.4491119,-104.6096929,5,"We had a wonderful evening here tonight! We reserved on the penthouse patio, gorgeous view of the city and a nice al fresco dining area. Seated initially in one of the banquette style seating tables - pro tip, if you have people in your party who are shorter, request (at time of reservation) to be seated at the traditional table and chairs seating. We asked if we could be moved, and our server checked with the hostess to make sure that there was a table available (that hadn't been reserved in advance) to seat us at. There was, but the restaurant was not as busy as one would expect on a beautiful Saturday summer evening, so we lucked out.
We ordered drinks, Aperol spritz was well made, cold and refreshing. The Cucumber Basil Gimlet was stellar. Cucumber/basil were a perfect match for the gin, and citrus ingredients gave lively sweet/sour notes. Served on rocks, it was a welcome aperitif for a warm humid evening.
Appetizers were shared; the Korean Kimchee Dumplings were delicious! Beautifully thin wrappers with pork and kimchee filling, steamed and served with a soy/sesame dipping sauce. The Giant Calamari Crown was a whole calamari tube, sliced into rings, delicately breaded and fried.  Tender, tasty, served with one of the best aioli's I've ever had - smoky, savoury, slightly spicy with an herbaceous note I couldn't identify but really enjoyed. Crab cakes were homemade with a nice crust, pan fried and served with chipotle remoulade, good texture and taste. Bruschetta was good, the tomato topping was fresh and tangy. My only issue is that I prefer the baguette slices toasted or grilled and these were served 'au naturel', not my personal taste...
Mains were the Double Cut Pork Chop stuffed with brie, pecans and dried cranberries (big appetite at the table), the Chicken Supreme with maple mustard glaze (for the smallest appetite). The pork chop was nicely seared, tender, juicy, served with a port reduction. The chicken was cooked perfectly on the bone; the glaze skewed more to being a sauce but it was quite delicious, more savoury than sweet, well balanced. Both were served with roasted baby potatoes that were creamy inside, and seasonal fresh vegetables cooked tender crisp, also tasty. Myself and the other member of our party ordered the fish special; pan fried Salmon filet with pineapple and apple salsa, seved with pecan fried rice and the fresh summer veg. The salmon filet was cooked perfectly, seared outside, moist and tender inside. The salsa was a fresh, tangy note that complimented the rich salmon. Pecan fried rice was astounding! A seemingly odd combination that was extremely yummy. We ate every bit of it😋
For dessert the large appetite had a Creme Brulee. The rest of us ordered one each of the three available desserts to share. Creme Brulee was nice, the custard was smooth, silky with perfect texture, the sugar crust torched to a golden brown that cracked satisfyingly when struck with the spoon. It was a hit with the creme brulee lovers at the table. The lemon tart had a light fresh filling topped with 3 individual meringues, lending a nice textural element. The crust was on the thick side and very difficult to cut into with the spoon, but the flavours were there. The absolute stand out was the Chocolate Torte! Dark, rich, decadent, sweet and bitter notes of the chocolate PERFECTLY balanced,SO GOOD
Our server Tegan was excellent😊 Friendly and personable.
We had 2 cocktails, a beer, 9 glasses of wine (couldn't agree on bottles!), 4 appies, 4 mains and 4 desserts. The bill, after tax and before tip, was 434$ We left stuffed and extremely happy. 5 stars, highly recommend...will eat here again next time I'm in town.
20Ten, you need to relocate to Vancouver where you would be truly valued and packed out every night...recent reviewers seem to lack a true appreciation for and/or familiarity with this style of food and dining!"

The food, apps didn’t have much flavour & the meats were pretty dry. Disappointing food (especially for how expensive), dessert was delicious.

Also the view was amazing at Sunset"

The ambience and atmosphere was outstanding, the service was fantastic, and the food was first class.  The quality, presentation, creativity, and flavour of each of the dishes were exceptional.  There was a lot of thoughts put into each of the plates.  20Ten City offers second to none, the finest dining experience.  Highly recommended."

I kept meaning to take pics before I dove in like a pig but I failed horribly. Trevor is the chefs name and his food is AMAZING.
20Ten City Eatery,Desserts,"2010 12th Avenue Regina, SK S4P 2B8 Canada",SK,50.4491119,-104.6096929,1,"I'm surprised with all the good ratings of this place. Visited from Toronto and decided to try the restaurant on a Friday evening, yet our experience at the 2010 restaurant was a great disappointment.  We tried to make a reservation by chat, email and phone and no one got back to us either way, so we decided to walk-in. When I told the manager this, he simply laughed it off and said that if we didn't get a response we didn't get a reservation. This caught me off guard and reflected on his unprofessional and rude demeanor.
They placed us at a wiggly table and we felt completely ignored. The evening wasn't that busy and there were a couple of empty tables. When we asked if we could change our table after a couple finished to get a better view the waitress came back and told us that the manager said it was booked. Yet we stayed past 9pm and no one came to claim the table. However,  one couple did come and surprisingly they changed their table three times. So basically from what I gather is, if you are a regular and an important personal you'll get the high-end golden treatment, if not you are treated with rudeness.
As for the food,  it is overpriced and nothing to crave about. Any good food critic would give them nothing higher than one star. If you are looking for something with flavor I'd recommend an ordinary pub such as Taverna or the pizza restaurant Famoso.
I do not recommend this restaurant.   Simply visit the restaurant for the view, (and order nothing more but one drink) but getting a helicopter ride to see the veiw of Regina would be a better experience. Bad service,  rude management,  overpriced food. Highly not recommended."
Caraway Grill,Indian,"1625 Broad Street Regina, SK S4P 1X3 Canada",SK,50.4525596,-104.6059291,5,"On our first time in Regina, we found this nice Indian restaurant with fantastic food and friendly staff. The Mix Veg pakora (gluten-free), as a free start, which mesmerized me, was so yummy and tangy 😍 Samosa (not gluten-free), Chana masala, and Fish curry were also delicious, as well as the Saffron rice. As a gluten-free person, I immensely enjoyed my dinner. If you did not try this place yet, add it to your must-go list 👍🏻 Bon Appetite!"
Caraway Grill,Indian,"1625 Broad Street Regina, SK S4P 1X3 Canada",SK,50.4525596,-104.6059291,5,I LOVED this restaurant! I ordered the chicken korma with saffron rice and garlic naan. The best chicken korma I’ve ever had! Next time I go I will request extra chicken. It’s that good.

Caraway Grill,Indian,"1625 Broad Street Regina, SK S4P 1X3 Canada",SK,50.4525596,-104.6059291,5,We have been coming here since it first opened!! I have tried almost every dish on the menu too!  Their lunch specials are very delicious and filling!  Their service is so welcoming and humbling.  With myself being East Indian and completely approving the variety of flavours and taste to be on par says a lot on how authentic it really is!
Caraway Grill,Indian,"1625 Broad Street Regina, SK S4P 1X3 Canada",SK,50.4525596,-104.6059291,5,This place blew me away!  Hands down some of the best SE asian food I've ever had.  The chef knows how to balance spice and flavour to let the ingredients shine through. This is my go-to place in Regina now.

The Fat Badger,Pubs,"1852 Scarth Street Regina, SK S4P 2G3 Canada",SK,50.4494534,-104.6110486,1,This used to be one of my favourite spot when I was working downtown with great service but have gone back three times in the last 6 months and the service has been terrible. It was between 2-3 pm when there hardly any customers there and the staff does not seem to care. You literally have to keep watching around for some to serve you a drink while everyone is chatting even when you are sitting at the bar. I literally wanted to get up and leave all three times but it was cold so just stayed.
The Fat Badger,Pubs,"1852 Scarth Street Regina, SK S4P 2G3 Canada",SK,50.4494534,-104.6110486,3,"This bar was subpar, I don’t recommend it and would not return. They have a simple selection of drinks and food. I tried their wings, which may have been the worst wings I’ve ever had. Also tried the shrimp po’boy, which was very salty. They had a chicken pot pie soup, it was odd tasting. Their fires were also very salty. My friend said the blt was good, and would order it again. Server was kind but didn’t know much about drinks. But she was diligent on getting the answers to our questions."
The Fat Badger,Pubs,"1852 Scarth Street Regina, SK S4P 2G3 Canada",SK,50.4494534,-104.6110486,1,"Cold food, terrible service. Sat at our table for over two hours and saw the waitress maybe 3 times. It was not busy enough to justify this. Waitress seemed more concerned with hanging out with her friends than serving customers. Would’ve liked to have more than two drinks over the 2+ hours at a bar. Definitely was not wanting to stay as long as we did but it took 45 minutes just to get a bill. Will not be returning."

The Diplomat Steakhouse,Steakhouses,"2032 Broad Street Regina, SK S4P 1Y3 Canada",SK,50.4463889,-104.6067948,5,"Best Steakhouse ever! I was randomly walking around. And I happened to walk by this building. And I was wondering what it looked like in the inside. Turns out it was open! So I walked in, and it turns out to be a fancy place! Which is awesome.
So someone escorted me to a seat. And when they asked me what I wanted to drink, I’ve asked for a double Cherry vodka. Which is awesome, because usually Cherry Vodka is not available at bars and stuff. So that was nice.
I normally don’t order seafood, but I’ve asked to get a fresh grilled Salmon. And the waitress recommended the better version, which was something I wasn’t expecting. So I got it, and wow did it ever tastes great. In fact, I wanted more lol. So I’ll make sure to get that again, if I have the luxury to go there again :)
As for the staff, all of them were really nice to me, Especially Alyssa. So keep up the good work guys!"

For staff service, I’d give an easy 5 stars. The waiter was courteous and checked in to ensure our meal was going great and we had all we needed throughout our stay.

For the food; it was tasty, well seasoned, satisfying and there was so much variety to choose from. It took a reasonable amount of time to prepare compared to some other fine dining outfits in the city that take more time.

The plating technique here is very impressive too.

Only downside is parking. The parking lot for this restaurant is quite small and not easily accessible."
The Diplomat Steakhouse,Steakhouses,"2032 Broad Street Regina, SK S4P 1Y3 Canada",SK,50.4463889,-104.6067948,3,"Although our last two experiences at the Diplomat had not been positive, we decided to give them another chance when friends from out of town arrived.  The waitress was wonderful (unfortunately I didn’t get her name), and the drinks were made to perfection.  Our friends had the Chateaubriand for Two, and said it was delicious.  I enjoyed the Diplomat Chicken, although the stuffed potato was burnt.  We were extremely disappointed in the 10 ounce steak my husband ordered - it was cooked to his preference, but the steak had so much gristle in it, he found it was inedible.  Our waitress offered to take it back, but this would delay his meal and we would be done by the time he got his meal back.  For this reason, he declined a replacement.  I suggested there should be a reduction on the bill, as the steak was priced at $46.95. I was vastly disappointed to see the restaurant took a mere $10 off.  Ultimately, we paid $36.95 for a piece of inedible meat.  This is the third strike - we will not be back."

Literally has changed my perspective on what steak should taste like, and every time I go, I leave in awe. Staff is old school cool and classy, but with modern and accepting of everyone. Wine collection and bar is best I have seen in Canada and will always tell people to go for the experience.

It's a spectacular spectacle that is worth it."
The Diplomat Steakhouse,Steakhouses,"2032 Broad Street Regina, SK S4P 1Y3 Canada",SK,50.4463889,-104.6067948,5,"Lovely restaurant and the staff are extremely friendly. You just always want to go back to a place like that.
The ambience is perfect as well. I brought my friend here to celebrate her birthday. Although they don't offer a birthday special or chef's special treat for birthdays, they were kind enough to let us bring our cake and they helped cut it and serve it to everyone at the table.
The food tastes so good. I ordered the New York Streak Strip and some potatoes.
For a special night out, you want to visit this place."

The chicken doesn't really jump out in flavor, however, it is balanced out with the waffle. The sauce/gravy has a flavour that I was not able to distinguish. It did, however, bring the waffle and chicken together."

It was a buffet and it was disappointing nothing but scraps in the buffet. This place was nice and many great options. Everything from Canadian Chinese to Vietnamese fresh noodle bowls. The ginger beef was a nice crispy with the right amount of spice. The pork noodle bowl was tender with the right amount of fat on the pork.
The serving of chilli oils on the table could have been fuller I was digging out the last bit.
The service could have been a bit better. The servers kept forgetting to fill our drinks.
Other wise the atmosphere was clean and a nice touch of colour."

Everytime I come, it’s always like this and to be honest I think the management staff should review and replace all employees if they continue like this."
Mei Wei Bistro,Chinese,"4626 Albert Street Regina, SK S4S 6B4 Canada",SK,50.4050764,-104.619663,5,Great food and good service. The wait was a bit  long but it worth it. Definitely try it with a group of people so you can order multiple dishes and share.
Mei Wei Bistro,Chinese,"4626 Albert Street Regina, SK S4S 6B4 Canada",SK,50.4050764,-104.619663,4,This is good Asian food close to home. Generally the food comes fairly quickly and the service is good. This time we were told after we were sat that the kitchen was backed up and our food would take at least 30 minutes. We were given the choice to stay or not. I didn’t like the wait but I liked I was given the truth and the option.  The only downside thing I can say is that the prices are a couple of bucks a plate more expensive that other similar restaurants.
Coney Island Cafe,Burgers,"4908 Dewdney Avenue Regina, SK S4T 1B8 Canada",SK,50.4553904,-104.6513847,4,"I’ll be honest, I don’t even really like poutines. I wasn’t overly looking forward to coming here but I had to give it a shot because of all the hype. I LOVED it!! So many choices (almost too many, makes it very hard to pick) and such a great value; there is SO much food, no one at our table could even finish their meals, seriously (Mmm, leftovers). Everything was delicious, even the burgers. I can’t wait to go back.

P.S. Coney Island rekindled my love for milkshakes."

I love their pick-a-dilly poutine and have ordered it more than id like to admit. If you're a pickle lover this is your poutine. Don't be fooled by their smaller size option, their poutines are very filling and a small always fills me up for hours."
Coney Island Cafe,Burgers,"4908 Dewdney Avenue Regina, SK S4T 1B8 Canada",SK,50.4553904,-104.6513847,5,Delicious food and a crazy good selection of poutines. This place won’t disappoint to fill you up and keep you eating even though you don’t want to. Gravy is very tasty and good consistency. Fries cooked well and taste good too.

Only got offered one round of drinks and no refills after that. The pizza was pretty good but salad and pasta was only okay. Gelato was a treat.

Famoso Neapolitan Pizzeria,Pizza,"1881 Scarth Street Regina, SK S4P 4K9 Canada",SK,50.44906,-104.6104207,3,"Very disappointing. We have enjoyed our experience at Famoso in the past. This time the carbonara sauce was bland curdled and separated and they also forgot the pancetta, the lettuce was rusty (the worst parts were in the garbage by the time the picture was taken). The wings themselves were good, but you can see a lack of care even in simply tossing them so the sauce would be evenly coated. The lasagna was fine, though not very warm which I will give a bit of a pass on since it was takeout. The pizza was good.

Edit: this review was intended for the east location, but I understand the ownership is the same regardless."

I would recommend. Had the chicken souvlaki. Again it was delicious. The service was great and friendly. Loved the original menu blow up on the wall.

Moxies,Canadian (New),"1800 Victoria Avenue E Regina, SK S4N 7K3 Canada",SK,50.4480824,-104.5587951,5,"Moxies is one of Regina's finest Restaurants. It has a clean sofisticated design which I enjoyed a lot. The staff are friendly and professional. The lighting for evening dining is perfect.

The appetizers, main course and desert were all very good. I was satisfied with the prices as well. I recommend you try out this fine dining restaurant. The booth area has a an intimate feel to it especially when it is dark with that low light."
Moxies,Canadian (New),"1800 Victoria Avenue E Regina, SK S4N 7K3 Canada",SK,50.4480824,-104.5587951,5,They have some of the best shrimp tacos! Staff was super friendly and they have a good menu. Would definitely come again

Had the Classic Canadian Pizza which was very good and a couple of drinks.  Allison, our bartender was great;  friendly and efficient.   Happy we chose this happy hour!"
Wild Sage Kitchen & Bar,Canadian (New),"1975 Broad Street Regina, SK S4P 1Y1 Canada",SK,50.4480833,-104.6061254,1,"Very dis-appointed as we waited 1/2 hour for a server, no beverage provided and then didn't take our order. We booked for a 4 night stay and if this is how the restaurant is run we will not return. A skeleton staff is no way to run a business. Patrons next to us waited for their bill for over 40 minutes and contemplated on just walking out. Servers have to acknowledge and inform customers ahead of time if there is a wait. Hotel staff is great but, the restaurant needs better management."
Wild Sage Kitchen & Bar,Canadian (New),"1975 Broad Street Regina, SK S4P 1Y1 Canada",SK,50.4480833,-104.6061254,5,Great restaurant located in the Double Tree hotel. 15 dollar pizza and pint special is more than enough food and terrific value.

We had the beet hummus and rock shrimp fritters to start - both things I wouldn’t normally choose but I was practically licking my plate after! I had the avocado club and Parmesan fries for my entree and it was delicious - a bit of spice but not too much, awesome dip for the fries. And of course dessert! The ice cream! Purple yam and salted egg ice creams - Can’t even describe, but definitely worth checking this place out!"
Siam Authentic Thai Restaurant,Thai,"1946 Hamilton Street Regina, SK S4P 2C4 Canada",SK,50.447905,-104.6097856,5,"Delicious food! Never been to Thailand but just feels very authentic!

Siam Authentic Thai Restaurant,Thai,"1946 Hamilton Street Regina, SK S4P 2C4 Canada",SK,50.447905,-104.6097856,5,"Great service and great tasting food. This is authentic in the way the food comes spicy. I don't think there is an ability to make anything mild (trust me I've asked on a variety of food items and always end up getting medium spiced food). I don't think they do true Thai spice levels but for those who can handle the heat, the hot is hot."
Siam Authentic Thai Restaurant,Thai,"1946 Hamilton Street Regina, SK S4P 2C4 Canada",SK,50.447905,-104.6097856,5,Went for dinner and loved the food. Shrimp cakes were delicious. Ambience is okay and service wasn't very prompt but the authentic taste makes up for it. Pad thai portion was decent but there wasn't much on the plate of shrimp with cashew (H04). Would come again and try other items on the menu.
Siam Authentic Thai Restaurant,Thai,"1946 Hamilton Street Regina, SK S4P 2C4 Canada",SK,50.447905,-104.6097856,5,"World class!!! In Regina of all places… the most amazing match of flavours, every piece of the meal was cooked to absolute perfection.  The Red Curry Pork was outstanding.  The drunken noodle was equally amazing. Can’t say enough about this place.  If you’re into Thai, you have to try this place!!!"
The Rooftop Bar & Grill,American (Traditional),"1845 Victoria Avenue Regina, SK S4P 0R2 Canada",SK,50.4468245,-104.6072585,4,"Definitely top 3 of my favourite restaurants in Regina.

- The staff here are super helpful and courteous.

- The restaurant environment is really neat, offers great lighting and is great for picture taking as well.

- The food was very tasty, well seasoned and cooked to my preference.

- Their food prices are moderate and there’s a wide variety of food options to choose from.

- Having a dedicated bar tender would be nice tho as there wasn’t one when we visited and the drinks had to be remade a few times.

If you’re also looking for a private dinning or small event room (up to 16 people), you can check out there Lucky 12 private room."
The Rooftop Bar & Grill,American (Traditional),"1845 Victoria Avenue Regina, SK S4P 0R2 Canada",SK,50.4468245,-104.6072585,4,"Great for gathering with family or friends. Has a pretty good selection of menu items, and good service from the staff."
The Rooftop Bar & Grill,American (Traditional),"1845 Victoria Avenue Regina, SK S4P 0R2 Canada",SK,50.4468245,-104.6072585,3,"We were very eager to visit as my husband  has had the Prime Rib multiple times and raved about it.  We wanted a table on the actual rooftop as it was a beautiful evening. Chairs are extremely uncomfortable and not met for someone with any extra body weight. It was a Saturday evening (6pm), one of the tables was enjoying their alcoholic beverages rather loudly and very colorful with their language.  I understand it's a Bar and Grill but it was a bit excessive.  Appy's were delicious, deep fried chicken dumplings and calamari. Cesar salad lacked dressing and croutons. Chicken Souvlaki was dry, fries had no crisp and raved about Prime Rib was far over done. Overall not impressed.  Might go back for drinks but not for a meal."
The Rooftop Bar & Grill,American (Traditional),"1845 Victoria Avenue Regina, SK S4P 0R2 Canada",SK,50.4468245,-104.6072585,3,"The night started out fine, server was friendly, courteous. Took a long time for our drinks though we felt they might be understaffed or we got forgotten about. I got a lime margarita, flavour was good though it didn’t come in a proper margarita glass nor was the rim salted. I ordered the steak and shrimp with pepper sauce and sweet fries. Steak was cooked well though it could have been trimmed better. The fries were good. The pepper sauce was disappointing, it tasted like mushroom soup( which I detest) there were no peppercorns that I could discover despite repeated searching. My partner had the baked penne with broccoli, she enjoyed her dinner. Not sure we would return."
The Rooftop Bar & Grill,American (Traditional),"1845 Victoria Avenue Regina, SK S4P 0R2 Canada",SK,50.4468245,-104.6072585,2,"Late supper date, food was below subpar. Calamari was rubbery and inconsistent. Caesar salad was flavorless and the lettuce was old, mushy and wilted. Lobster pasta was made with a can sauce and dried noodles, burger was frozen, had a very odd flavor like it was old. Fries were hot but floppy and soft, no crisp to them. Overall really bad experience, over priced for the kind of food you'd expect from a lunchroom cafeteria."
Memories Dining & Bar,French,"1717 Victoria Avenue Regina, SK S4P 0P9 Canada",SK,50.4468928,-104.6054355,5,"Absolutely excellent dining experience for our first time at this restaurant.

Mai Phuong Restaurant,Vietnamese,"1821 Broad Street Regina, SK S4P 1X7 Canada",SK,50.4498962,-104.6061987,5,"I ordered the Appetizer Combo Platter. The BBQ chicken was fantastic, the Beef was perfect, the mixed veggies were fresh and tasty. The pork wasn't quite as good as normal, but still tasty.
I just wish that they delivered to my area! Open up something in the Northwest, please."
Mai Phuong Restaurant,Vietnamese,"1821 Broad Street Regina, SK S4P 1X7 Canada",SK,50.4498962,-104.6061987,5,"Well I have to give 5 stars to this place
I came here lots of times and I don’t need to read menu just order Xl beef ball soup, BBQ duck, Bubble Tea，Garlic ribs and my favorite spicy sauce(a little bit sweet). By the way, I've been to Calgary and can't enjoy these delicious food every day, so I came here thousands of miles to have a bite of hot noodles a few days ago. If I have chance or free time in the future and I will be back."
Mai Phuong Restaurant,Vietnamese,"1821 Broad Street Regina, SK S4P 1X7 Canada",SK,50.4498962,-104.6061987,5,"I been going to Mai Phuong for the longest time, it is a hidden gem. The food is always great, along with the service. I almost always stick with the double beef on rice (which is absolutley amazing paired with the hot sauce that comes with it) but I have had other things like the pho which is also great. Family run business, I haven't been here during the lunch buffet or nor have I tried it but I'm sure it's just as great. Definitely a place I reccomend A+."

Thanks so much, Mai Phuong!!!!!!"
Regent Family Restaurant,Pizza,"3823 Sherwood Drive Regina, SK S4R 6N1 Canada",SK,50.4742878,-104.636387,5,"This is our second visit this year and it’s such a treat every time. The service is excellent and fast even when they are packed full. My family of five ordered two 8” pepperoni pizza, chicken souvlaki with fries, pork souvlaki with mash potatoes, beef dip with fries. The souvlaki’s were so delicious. So tender and full of flavor. I highly recommend this place. Can’t wait to be back. Their pizzas are one of the best in the city too!"

It doesn't look like much from the outside and is tucked into the corner of the plaza, but the inside had great atmosphere, fantastic service and even better food! Serving sizes were huge and their Greek fries are to die for! Everyone in our party left awed!"
Regent Family Restaurant,Pizza,"3823 Sherwood Drive Regina, SK S4R 6N1 Canada",SK,50.4742878,-104.636387,5,"Can't rave enough of this place ❤️.. Honestly speaking I didn't have high hopes at first entering the place and settled my expectations at ""possible decent to average dining experience"". Not so attractive interior with a touch of retro looks. Very basic and simple.
But they reminded me again of an old saying - "" don't judge a book by its cover"".
By far THE BEST MEAT PLATTER we have had in Canada till date. They say it's a platter for two but can easily satisfy four hungry people.
Highly recommended.

Service is very fast.. it took them hardly 15-20 mins from order to table.
Definitely going back again but with bigger gang..
⭐ Recommended."
Regent Family Restaurant,Pizza,"3823 Sherwood Drive Regina, SK S4R 6N1 Canada",SK,50.4742878,-104.636387,5,"Got the pork souvlaki with rice, greek salad, T-bone steak with a poutine, and a ceaser salad. Very delicious! Really recommend the steak, poutine, and greek salad!"

The Canadian Brewhouse,Sports Bars,"4820 Gordon Road Regina, SK S4W 0B7 Canada",SK,50.407392,-104.649987,5,"We had Sarah as our server tonight at Canadian Brewhouse south and her service was very good; happy and very fast. Hats off to the bar tender and the kitchen staff as well. Drinks were very fast, as was the food. Brewhouse reliably has great wings so I would suggest checking them out on Wednesdays for wing night.

The Canadian Brewhouse,Sports Bars,"4820 Gordon Road Regina, SK S4W 0B7 Canada",SK,50.407392,-104.649987,2,"We enjoy eating at Canadian Brewhouse restaurants, I know they aren’t the classiest of joints but years ago the food was pretty good. We won’t go back to this location. We have ate here 3 times in the last year and the service was lousy every time. This last visit I ordered a Brisket Grilled Cheese with fries for $19.99. Our meals were served with no cutlery or napkins, it took a long time to get a server to bring us some. Probably because the server never served the food just some guy complaining he got called in on his day off. Welcome to the real world buddy!! Lol
The Grilled cheese was two pieces of toasted Texas toast with a slice of cheddar so thin it was translucent. The meat was warmed but overall had too many cold spots to enjoy it, it was wasn’t warm enough to melt the cheese. How can this be called grilled cheese if it isn’t even grilled nor enough cheese to constitute a cheese sandwich? The waitress offered to have it remade but honestly how can you screw up a grilled cheese sandwich? I declined.  She took $4 off the bill instead. See the picture."
The Canadian Brewhouse,Sports Bars,"4820 Gordon Road Regina, SK S4W 0B7 Canada",SK,50.407392,-104.649987,4,"We were happy to find the kitchen still serving after 10pm on a Sunday, when dining choices are a lot more limited. The Impossible Burger version of the Spicy Hickory BBQ sandwich was tasty, as were the mini pierogis. Lots of the menu was higher priced than I expected, but that's the same everywhere these days. The best thing about our visit was our friendly and attentive server Sara. She made us feel welcome right away, even though we're not usually fans of the sports bar atmosphere.

We'd visit again next time we're out late and in the area."
The Canadian Brewhouse,Sports Bars,"4820 Gordon Road Regina, SK S4W 0B7 Canada",SK,50.407392,-104.649987,5,Sarah was very sweet and helpful when we needed drinks or food. She checked on us multiple times to make sure we were all doing okay and had everything we needed. Following that she was very smiley and happy throughout the entire time that she was serving us. I believe that she is an amazing waitress and woman all together. As for customer service she is very good at that and accommodating. ❤️
The Canadian Brewhouse,Sports Bars,"4820 Gordon Road Regina, SK S4W 0B7 Canada",SK,50.407392,-104.649987,5,"Very good experience here, sorry will be a long review, went on October 28 with friends as it was my birthday month and I had free nachos on the App to redeem.
My friends got some appetizers as well and all of them were very good.
I was very shocked by the size of the nachos and could barely make a dent in them in the restaurant, I ended up taking them home and sharing them with my kids after.
Our waitress I have since forgotten her name was awesome and she was very attentive and in a great mood and she was just starting her shift it was nice to go to a restaurant and have Good vibes all around and have the wait staff be genuinely friendly and happy and they were all dressed up as well in the Halloween spirit.
We threw the hostess off a bit as my friend was wearing a large brimmed hat for her gothic Halloween costume and I was wearing a pumpkin shirt and leggings with pumpkins on them. She complimented us on our costumes and my friend looked at her with a straight face and said what costumes? this is our everyday wear! The hostess had a look of horror on her face until we started laughing and said just kidding and then she laughed as well.
5* keep it up! Can't wait to come back again to enjoy the atmosphere"
Peking House,Chinese,"1850 Rose Street Regina, SK S4P 3Y9 Canada",SK,50.4497977,-104.6082241,5,"My dining experience at Peking House was exceptional! The ambiance was cozy and inviting, and the service was friendly and attentive. I ordered the Yang Chow fried rice and seafood hot plate, and they were both outstanding and my favorite. The rice was perfectly cooked and the seafood hot plate was flavorful and cooked to perfection. The presentation of the dishes was beautiful and the portion sizes were generous. Overall, I had a wonderful time and would highly recommend Peking House to anyone looking for authentic Chinese cuisine and a great dining experience here in Regina downtown."
Peking House,Chinese,"1850 Rose Street Regina, SK S4P 3Y9 Canada",SK,50.4497977,-104.6082241,5,"This is a restaurant specialising in Beijing cuisine that I thoroughly enjoyed. When our family came to eat, the staff was attentive, dedicated, and carefully guided about the food. They didn't leave us alone especially considering the fact that there were only two of us and one guest table on that Monday. When it comes to food, the food here is outstanding for my family because the dishes we ordered were neither too salty nor too sweet. Also, the fish maw and crab soup, yang chou fried rice, and bbq duck are all excellent."
Peking House,Chinese,"1850 Rose Street Regina, SK S4P 3Y9 Canada",SK,50.4497977,-104.6082241,3,"We ordered in advance for pickup, and were given a time of 45 minutes before the order would be ready.  We prefer waiting for good food.  However when we arrived, they were extremely busy, and unfortunately we waited another 45 minutes to an hour after paying for the order for our food to be ready.  Again, we prefer to wait for good food as opposed to having it rushed, however if the establishment was that busy, letting us know the wait would be longer than normally anticipated would have been better than waiting around the crowded entry and parking lot.
The food was definitely great, priced a tad high, and the extra wait without as much as a word or an apology left us a bit unimpressed."
Peking House,Chinese,"1850 Rose Street Regina, SK S4P 3Y9 Canada",SK,50.4497977,-104.6082241,1,"Spent 150.00 for 7 people. Only got 2 fortune cookies, and enough lemon and sweet and sour sauce for 1 person. Really !!! Why is your take out food not as good as your in person food? I realize that take out is never as good as being there in person, but I ordered dinners for 10+ people before and it was still good. This time I ordered out favourite items off menu for my special guests. After raving about your food, I was embarrassed and disappointed especially with the shrimp, which was in most dishes. It’s hard to let go of what I considered best Chinese in Regina."
Peking House,Chinese,"1850 Rose Street Regina, SK S4P 3Y9 Canada",SK,50.4497977,-104.6082241,5,Food was great.

Fireside Bistro,Bistros,"2305 Smith Street Regina, SK S4P 2P7 Canada",SK,50.4422962,-104.6147604,5,"The brunch at Fireside Bistro is fantastic!  They have a great little patio outside or  inside seating in the lounge area or in their regular dining room.

They have a variety of breakfast and lunch items to choose from.  From waffles loaded with warm strawberries to make your own omelet or choose from 6 different eggs Benedict, there is something for everyone.

I had the Oaxacan Benedict, which was served spicy Chorizo.  It will leave your tastebuds tingling!"

I got platter deal for 2 and it was really small portion.if you order these kebabs and meals separately, it would be more reasonable."

The dressings came on the side which I love. Then I can control how much dressing I want. There's nothing worse than too much dressing or sauce on food destroying the dish."

I had the dill egg salad sandwhiche and it felt like a gourmet meal. They also have funky coffee and tea drinks, so it’s nice to even stop in for a quick to go item.

I was impressed by how many nooks and crannies the space had, there’s a back room you might even be able to reserve for a shower or party! Great neighborhood cafe/restaurant!"

However the last couple of times I have went there I have had to wait longer than usual and the lattes have been awful! Poorly made, too strong, coffee grounds in my drink. The one I got this morning was undrinkable. I expect more when I am paying $7."

So nice atmosphere. Service they offer is exclusive! Food was done in nothing! I think they were waiting for us with our dishes prepared and all! 😂😂
I had the """"LOBSTER BENEDICT """" and my husband had """"BISTRO SKILLET"""" .
and we also had a cappuccino.  It came down to 68dls. AMAZING!"

It’s got a nice kick to it and I normally can’t handle spicy food but dang, this was soooo good! My partner got the shakshuka and she couldn’t even finish it all with such large portion. (Even better to have leftovers)

Our server had started there for only a week and he was super friendly and very quick!

The sister restaurant, Luna is a must. Have to try the Athenian!"

Breakfast Bistro did not disappoint. From the moment you walk through the door, the ambience of the restaurant is so inviting you never want to leave. Of course the food is spectacular, always consistently bringing out the best dishes (and the best mimosas and daiquiris).

But the service here is unlike any other. I elected for a dairy heavy meal - even though I’m lactose intolerant - and 3 servers made sure to check in on me and even brought me some lactose pills. All of them were so kind and talkative, even though I had brunch by myself!

If you’re ever in Regina, you’d be remiss not to try Breakfast Bistro. You won’t be disappointed!"

I enjoyed the atmosphere of the Breakfast Bistro, we sat inside and enjoyed the modern decor, but there was an outdoor patio that might have been nice to try as well.

Have a special occasion coming up? Give this place a try!"

Good food, but overpriced.  We spent $40 to share a single breakfast (avocado/ eggs benedict on waffle) and two (non refillable) mugs of coffee.  The presentation was excellent, like a boutique style restaurant, service was more of a coffee shop feel.  The tables arent set, we had to collect utensils at the front counter (which is more of a coffee shop feel). We also had go to the counter to pay."

The Lobby Kitchen and Bar,Bars,"2545 S Broad Street Regina, SK S4P 0M9 Canada",SK,50.4386939,-104.6057627,1,"Updated review: Tried The Lobby again for lunch with some friends after 5 months. It’s not better. If you can’t cook something, take it off the menu. Or if you know it’s burnt, don’t send it out. This was the case with my salad. I ordered the Apple Walnut salad with salmon and the salmon underneath was completely burnt and hard, looked like chicken. The service was better but I’m still not impressed. I still stand by my previous review and I’ll like never refer someone to The Lobby.

Very disappointed in the service. We had a group of 8 and had to wait 10-20 minutes for the waitress to ask us if we needed more drinks, not to mention my brother is still waiting for his refill…As we were wrapping up to leave, the restaurant was completely empty save us and a single other patron. There were absolutely NO staff in sight for about 20 minutes. We were finally able to wave over one staff member who tried to charge my grandfather for the entire table when we had 4 separate bills. Most of us were pleased with our drinks and food, despite some of it being on the pricey side. However, this did nothing to outweigh the terrible service."

It's far enough away from downtown that you don't get some of the more unpleasant clientele that hangs out in that area.  The owners and the staff are very personable and the food (especially the Wings, Pizza, and Tacos) is really good.

It also probably has the best Patio in the city and we always have a great time here."

We sat in the lounge and the place looks well traveled in people wise, and the menus may look a little dated, but I feel this brings a very Italian character feel to it in some way.
The pizza we ordered was the Juliana's Special from the back page of the menu, and we were not disappointed when our server said it was a pretty thick layered pizza! The flavour was on point for how it's described in the menu - fresh ingredients, quality crust, and you can taste the love in every bite! My kind of place!!
I am incredibly sad we do not have a Juliana's back home, but it will be a pizza I remember!!"

Their Google hours of operation state they are open until 11pm (and say updated 1 week ago, as of June 1st 2023) everyday but when you call their business their automated phone service states they’re only open until 10. Thanks for lying for no apparent reason about your hours, that’s super helpful to those who plan in advance. Will go to a business that doesn't lie about their hours in the future.  Also for those looking the atmosphere of this place was heavily influenced by a 1980’s truck stop. Thanks for nothing Juliana’s."

Got a combo of pizza, dry ribs, pop and a side salad and it was all delicious. Order was ready in under 25 mins for pickup. I normally dislike extra thick layer of toppings on pizza but this has now made me a convert to a thick pizza. It was cooked perfectly and not soggy on the bottom at all. Will definitely be ordering from them regularly from now on!"

Our server was very friendly and patient. Food was excellent. I would definitely recommend their florida special sandwich with the garlic parmesan fries. I liked the atmosphere all around with those little candles and the music. Also, the brownie dessert was my favourite part of the meal that night. I may have named the items a different than what exactly they are in the menu but that’s the closest I could remember them."

Prices on the high end (for the area) but you definitely won't be disappointed. Went to this place several times this week while in town. Will definitely be back!!! The two pics are the lettuce wrap app, and the blackened chicken Alfredo. The chicken was done perfectly! Moist and very flavorful. Side tip is to add Cajun thru out the pasta as well.

It was quiet since it was after the lunch rush.  The meals were tasty, bursting with flavour. Portions were a little small for the price.  But then everywhere seems to be higher in price these days.   Szechuan beef noodle bowl x3 spicy was just a nice amount of spice for accentuated flavour.  If you are one that wants a burning sensation, you can always get hotter than what they offer.
Others had Tiki Tuna Poke bowl, burger and fries, and chicken quesadilla.  The fries and gravy were quite welcoming surprisingly.
The service was attentive, polite and welcoming."

Service was slow which I was surprised by as it wasn't that busy maybe 5 other tables. The atmosphere was nice we sat outside the downside was the tree above us it needs pruning. I would eat there again but maybe go not as hungry next time.

I’ve worked in the industry for 18 years and currently agave worked my way up to being a GM and I’m proud, that being said I was throughly disappointed with Travis tonight and his bartender guest experience.

Great for special occasions but make sure you call ahead for a reservation as they have limited spots. Parking is limited so if you go with a group it is best to carpool together. The food, service and experience is great. My family of 4 ordered a combination entree each, alcoholic drinks for 2 and 2 desserts which equaled to $300+ without tips. The chef gave us a complimentary sake which was nice. I wouldn't recommend the deep fried ice cream and deep fried banana. Everything else tasted good."

The only issue is you'll pay quite a bit and you'll leave hungry. By quite a bit, I mean you could eat steak and lobster at the Keg, have great service, and you'd be out about the same $$$, though the Keg won't juggle fire at your table... This place is good for an experience but I can't imagine wanting to repeat it very often.

The ramen broth was gross, noodles were cheap, veggies were old, the egg was way overdone, the pork was overcooked and cut into sad little strips, it was like eating tiny strips of leather, and the rice was old and dry.

Ramen is served in a plastic bowl with plastic cutlery and the rice is served in a small paper bowl.

This is one of those places you wish you couldn't see the food being prepared in.  The kitchen is filthy, the decor and lighting in the dining area has years of dust caked on them.

With the close proximity to the Uni, I genuinely feel like they're preying on students that just don't know any better.

The Canadian Brewhouse,Sports Bars,"2005 Prince of Wales Drive Regina, SK S4V 3A3 Canada",SK,50.446987,-104.5314768,3,"Have enjoyed Canadian Brewhouse in the past.   However, we had issues with the cleanliness and food availability when we were there on Friday June 30 at 6pm.

Several items on the menu which were recommended to us by the server, were not available.  Our party, and the server, only become aware after the order was placed.   This implies poor communication with management when items listed as specials (several drink specials) as well as common items like onion rings were not longer available.

Also, we sat in the patio area at the top of the restaurant and, even though we don't expect cleanliness to be a top priority for outdoor seating, the quality in this case was terrible.   Many of the tables and chairs were covered in bird droppings with no attempt made to clean them.  We managed to move things around sufficiently to find a clean area for our group, but we were surprised there was no attempt made by Canadian Brewhouse staff to assist.

Definitely not the standards I expect from this restaurant."
The Canadian Brewhouse,Sports Bars,"2005 Prince of Wales Drive Regina, SK S4V 3A3 Canada",SK,50.446987,-104.5314768,4,Went for the 40 oz steak nite. Had an issue with my tickets and the woman helping me was so friendly. Waitress was a lil cold after we had issues. Finally got it all sorted and our steaks came 😀 . They were very flavorful but extremely fatty as is shown in the 2nd pic. All in all was well worth the price. Will definitely go again if they have this night again!
The Canadian Brewhouse,Sports Bars,"2005 Prince of Wales Drive Regina, SK S4V 3A3 Canada",SK,50.446987,-104.5314768,4,"Went in and had a bad experience with the manager on shift. The General Manger Ken Poag was quick to reach out and address the matter. He sorted things out in a polite manager.

Good food, Good servers, Overall a good place. If you are in the area and need good place to sit down. Give Brewhouse a try."

I was unsure what the kids would think but everyone more than loved the food!! The rolls, bowls, and pad thai was all so very very good! On top of the great food we dealt with two staff members and they were both fantastic! Everyone said we have to come back when we are back in Regina."

Large portions, broth is really good. Good very flavourful. nice

They have some spaces cordoned off and it's bit of a maze. There are no parking spaces around it, so we parked on Angus St"
Viet-Thai Restaurant,Thai,"2080 Albert Street Regina, SK S4P 2T7 Canada",SK,50.4457019,-104.6185206,4,"Was an order of take out. I will say I was quite happy with the service given here. This is some of the best take out food of (this kind) I've ever had. Price was far less than everywhere else in the city. Restaurant appeared to be clean when I walked inside to pay. Staff seemed knowledgeable of the type of food being sold. Food packaging was perfect for portion size! Except for the fortune cookies only given 2 fortune cookies for a dinner of 4 I bought :( all of that aside, I'd recommend Viet-Thai over any other Thai food chain restaurants I've been to. This place was awarded the best Chinese food year over year in the city for a reason. Keep up the great work highly recommended. The downside was that the inside could use a bit of renovations and / or better styling. It was clean for sure. However, looked slightly dated for the year we're in now. As well parking is utterly horrible, in my opinion, some to the rear or the building for free, as well as out front for payment."
Viet-Thai Restaurant,Thai,"2080 Albert Street Regina, SK S4P 2T7 Canada",SK,50.4457019,-104.6185206,5,"I highly recommend trying the food combo at Viet Thai Restaurant, featuring the mouthwatering Pork on Skewer, Grilled Chicken, and Stir-Fried Lemongrass Shrimp. The flavors are incredible, and each dish is cooked to perfection. You also have the option to choose between 2 Spring Rolls or 2 Fresh Rolls, which are equally delicious. Don't miss out on this amazing combination!"
Viet-Thai Restaurant,Thai,"2080 Albert Street Regina, SK S4P 2T7 Canada",SK,50.4457019,-104.6185206,5,"Honestly if I could give a place 6 stars I would. I am a HUGE Vietnamese food fanatic and this was hands down one of the best places I've eaten. Number 39 or 40 is the go to! 17 bucks and you get the biggest bowl of all time.

And on top if you order the fresh salad rolls, they give you 2 MASSIVE rolls. Def recommended.

Also Tin the server, man is an absolute beauty. So friendly and nice. Go just for him 👏👏"

At the start the place was an absolute gem.  The food was flavourful, the prices modest, the service quick and the staff extremely personable.   I brought all my friends and family here and they too became regular customers, telling their friends and family.  Year after year it has got worse in every area to the point where I've stopped going and so does everyone I know.  The food is bland, expensive for what you get (the platter is just a 25 dollar bowl of rice with hardly any meat) service is slow and the new staff clearly don't care about their work or the customer.  I've been the only person in and there are five employees working and still it takes forever to make my meal.  I wrote this entire review while waiting in line and I've now waited 20 minutes to get a platter made-- last time I'm ever coming here.  Too bad."

Had the lentil soup, grannies special and a wrap, all were delicious!!!
Was my first time here, staff were very helpful in explaining the different options and combos.
Then made recommendations for the wrap by asking a few simple questions about my likes, such as sweet or spicy and was went with their recommendations, glad I did!
I enjoy my wraps and this place is top notch!"

Red Lobster,Seafood,"890 Albert Street Regina, SK S4R 2P5 Canada",SK,50.4648497,-104.6185743,2,"Experience...Not good. Had to wait for an hour before food was served. Ordered medium rare steak, got a well-done one instead (see picture), lacked flavor too! The lady who attended to us apologized for the delay in serving our food which was good, but then said initially that the bill will be on the house because of the delay as per the manager, only to return and say that it wasn't and a discount will be given instead. Proper communication needs to be better. Lobster tasted great though esp the sauce, I have to give credit to that. I like the ambiance of the place. But overall, not a very good dine-in experience."

Dosa & Curry Garden,Indian,"2143 Albert Street Regina, SK S4P 2V1 Canada",SK,50.4447071,-104.61778,5,"Must try this eatery.

100% authentic South Indian food.

What I liked the best about this eatery is, that they are entirely focused on food quality rather then spending thousands of dollars on decor as I have noticed in many restaurants in Regina and other cities where eateries have decor worth million but food quality not good at all.

This eatery have simple but functional dinning area. (See pictures)

We ordered Tandoori Pomfret, Madras Fish Curry and Onion Dosa. Food presentation, Taste and quantity was simply outstanding. The best South Indian Food we have eaten in long time.

None of the food was spicy for us. Each items tasted different and unique. Onion Dosa crunchy from outside and very soft inside. All the sauces served with all the dishes were very delicious as well.

Place was busy with dine in and take outs.

Met the owner, Raj. He was cooking serving and attending customers. Always a good sign for family run business.

Highly recommended."
Dosa & Curry Garden,Indian,"2143 Albert Street Regina, SK S4P 2V1 Canada",SK,50.4447071,-104.61778,3,"I would rate it 3.5/5. It's a low-key, homey restaurant which I liked. The portions are generous and reasonably priced. The food itself was okay to me - Definitely not bad but wouldn't call it one of my top experiences for Indian food. The hot and sour soup was the spiciest soup I've ever had in my life anywhere - Did not expect to find that at a restaurant in Regina!"

I have never ever done it no matter how bad the food is.. however, this time it went beyond bad and I have had a pathetic experience and it triggered me to write a review.
My brother ordered lunch for me and he chose Noodles and Manchurian..
😥 Disgusting food.. burnt Manchurian and the level of spice was to an extent that we could hardly taste the food.. it was just the spice.
Really disappointed. They should at least not serve burnt food."

Had to wait a the waitress advised she had a big party to tend to and would get back to us. Ordered tea and my pot of ware was warm so had to ask for another one. This time it came hot. Was not offered any refills though.

ATM machine was left unlocked and unattended to at 11pm.  That was weird."
Boston Pizza,Pizza,"4303 Rochdale Boulevard Regina, SK S4X 4R3 Canada",SK,50.4960476,-104.6427872,4,"Boston Pizza is a consistent, reliable chain restaurant. The food preparation is standardized and you can generally depend on getting a decent quality product. Having arrived at our hotel later in the day, we were looking for something close and quick. We split a small pizza and had a salad each. The garden salad at BPs is better than those at most other chains. Along with a mix of greens, there was several veggies added, including grated beets. The salad has character and doesn’t seem like the restaurant is trying to save money by limiting ingredients. This location in Regina was friendly and quick. Would go back again."

My family and I had dinner here for my birthday and the server was really rude to us. Either she was racist or she just found black people annoying but she rolled her eyes every time she had to serve us. The worst was when she came to collect the bills and she made it so clear that she did not want to serve us. As if that wasn’t enough she continued to roll her eyes at us while serving another table next to us."

Ordered the Deli sandwich which was good, but extremely small. Also ordered the side Cesar salad which is where things went downhill. Clearly the lettuce is not washed as every single piece still has lots of visible dirt on it. I think washing your produce is the bare minimum of expectations when paying +$40 for a lunch for 2 that still leaves you hungry.

Look elsewhere if hungry in the area."

The bagel sandwiches and breakfast bowls are my favourite. The sandwiches are decent and I know others really like hot lunch offerings. They do have a liquor license for that after work drink. Really eclectic vibe and you can purchase plants, local artwork and seasonal produce occasionally. Sweet treats are a limited selection and they don't have pastries, pies or cakes."

A perfect breakfast. They switch up their specialty drinks and food all t he time so it's worth following them on Insta - I'm still thinking about the butterfly pea coconut tea I had last year. Super refreshing on a hot day and just what I needed.

While I was in a shop recently, a gentleman came in insisting that he lost his wallet - he clearly didn't and just wanted some food but the owners were super kind and gave him some even though I offered to pay. This is a cafe that supports their community and I love that."

When we ordered, we put half the order in with one lady and then the phone was passed to another person to finish the order. When I picked it up and took it home, we were missing a dish. We figure because 2 different people were taking our order. We called to let them know so I had to drive back to pick it up. I want to specify that they forgot to charge and include it in my original order. When I went back they charged me for the single dish that they forgot.  I feel that since it was their mistake, they shouldn’t be charging me since my family was sitting at home waiting for me to get back to start eating. It took me about 25 minutes there and back so the food waiting for me at home was not as hot anymore. We all had to microwave our food. There are so many places to choose from and yes, this was my go to… but customer service is at the top of my priority list so I will not be going back."

My family and I went to rock creek for a birthday and we were one of the only tables in the building… Our food took about an hour and 15 minutes to get to the table and once our food got to the table one of the meals was completely wrong, so we sent it back and it came back wrong three more times. After we were finished our meals the server brought our bills and no discount or apology for the slow service , the meal being wrong THREE TIMES. So I asked for a discount on the bills and she gave us a dollar off each of our bills , seriously a joke!!"

When we arrived we were the only people in the dining room. A very pleasant girl took us to our table, gave us water and said our waiter would be there soon. We saw more people arrive, three other tables while we waited for our server to arrive.  Later we looked over and saw the other tables being served their drinks, have their orders taken while we were still waiting for service.  After waiting even longer we decided to leave and went to another establishment filled with about 30 customers all being served. So I can only judge the service as low since we never did get drinks or food. Do better Rock Creek. This used to be a favorite spot but no more. We will not be back."

Also a customer was at the bar ordering beer and everything he asked for was not in stock. He got fed up and asked the bar tender “ well… what do you have “

I never ever have complained on a restaurant online, but this is a WARNING

WORST food ive ever tried to consume - anyone liking this joint has never had a half decent meal in their life.
Ordered - 'famous' verm and char pork w spring roll.  Verm had no sweet sauce on it, 'pork' was absolutely disgusting anf Id challenge that they are even actually serving real pork.  The springs roll - dont even know how to say it bc im not sure what they actually were.  Some weird stuffing inside a THICK wonton wrapper, completely undercooked and not crisp at all. Disgusting.
Dry ribs - box packed full, but absolutely no meat, honestly not even 2oz total meat on this 2lb box. This is not even a 'number 2' riblet, no half decent place would ever serve this atrocious product.
Next, 'curry' seafood. Laughable. No sear on the scallops, prawns were precooked and warmed thru, there 4 of each and 2 whole peppers and a whole onion chopped up packing the container. the sauce was not 'curry' at all, some fatty consume with a hint of basil.
The white rice was acceptable.
I ordered and they said 15m, I walked over in 8mins and it was rrady - I should have left then.

Unquestionably the worst meal ive ever ordered from anywhere, ever."

Unfortunately, this time, it was unavailable. Our waitress Whitney was exceptional in every way and she suggested the cheesecake, which was delicious.

MR MIKES SteakhouseCasual,Steakhouses,"4651 Gordon Road Regina, SK S4W 0B7 Canada",SK,50.4050892,-104.64781,1,"My husband and I were looking for a place to become regulars at as we often work long hours. We drive by the Mr. Mike's grassland location almost everyday so we decided to give it a try. We ordered 2 steak and shrimp dinners for take out. The atmosphere and service was ok. I ended up by finding someone when I arrived as I waited for several minutes and didn't see one server. I have never been more disappointed in a meal especially for a restaurant that has the word steakhouse in its name. Everything was absolutely doused in a coursely of ground black pepper much like Montreal steak spice. Both steaks were dry, tasteless and very very tough. We ordered med rare and medium steaks. The vegetables were absolutely rock hard with burnt sear marks on them. I opted for the Caesar salad as a side and was flabbergasted when I opened the container because it was a spring mix lettuce mix, no romaine, no croutons, no parmesan cheese, but it did have a side of Caesar dressing. My husband had fries and gravy for his side. The gravy tasted so synthetic. It was as if someone opened a box of Campbell's vegetable soup broth and heated it up and added a cornstarch slurry to it to try and make it pass as gravy. The only thing good in both of our meals was the shrimp. The rest was horrible . We spent 100 dollars on this meal as it was a special occasion for us. I contacted the manager via email and never even got so much as a response from him. Very disappointed not only are we out 100 dollars but it's clear that the manager doesn't care either. This place will not become our regular place."

Le Macaron,Bakeries,"2705 Quance Street E Regina, SK S4V 3B7 Canada",SK,50.4438808,-104.5443812,4,"This is the first French bakery I visited; in general, the space was not outstanding, but because the bakery appears to be cozy and the bakery has both a cafe and sells breakfast, many people prefer to visit because of the convenience shop type. Concerning the staff, I dislike the staff here because they are impatient in waiting for their customers. For example, last week when I went to buy a cake, they were impatient and had a bad attitude toward me. Instead of waiting for me to ask, ""Anything Else?"" I believe they should guide and recommend delicious and unique cakes to new customers.
The second is about the cake I purchased, which consists of a dozen Macarons, a Pitasschio, and a Fruit tart, as shown below. They all have the same flaw in my opinion and taste: the cream in the cake is too sweet and very sweet. It was too sweet for me to eat any longer. By definition, macarons are sweet, but in terms of taste, the flavours I purchased are nothing special except for chocolate, because chocolate flavour is the flavour that shows its taste most clearly and accurately.
If I have the opportunity again, I will try other bakery dishes, but I will not recommend them to those who are not as fond of sweets as I am. However, if you enjoy French cakes, you can try them and make suggestions."

At first I thought the ingredients were low quality, but that was because it was undercooked. On the second time I can confirm the toppings are top-tier and would recommend."
Houston Pizza,Pizza,"3422 Hill Avenue Regina, SK S4S 0W9 Canada",SK,50.4283771,-104.6310102,1,"Ordered a XL Pizza from this place, and it was awful. The Pizza is about half of what it normally is, and the quality wasn't there. I ordered from this place before and it was good but this time it was very lackluster. I left a complaint with the employee for the manager and didn't hear back, but I expected something better then this for what i've ordered. I atleast would've liked to hear from the manager of why there wasn't much meat and fewer toppings all of a sudden, but I guess they don't care for loyal customers."
Houston Pizza,Pizza,"3422 Hill Avenue Regina, SK S4S 0W9 Canada",SK,50.4283771,-104.6310102,1,"We ordered the combo for 4. Fries and gravy were ice cold and the souvlaki smelled very off,we didn't eat it because it smelled so bad. The pizza was okay but also cold and not as good as usual. We have ordered from here for years,this is very disappointing."

Wings dumped all over pizza box,  the garlic bread was rock hard.  Ribs were good and wings, lasagna was ok.  The driver took forever.  Sat on my street and then took off and  came back again.  I had to stand outside for driver to see me.  Not impressed."

They have kind, knowledgeable, well trained staff who really make the transaction effortless. Oh!! AND... the garlic toast...fresh homemade bread! Amazing!!"
Houston Pizza,Pizza,"919 Albert Street Regina, SK S4R 2P6 Canada",SK,50.4636755,-104.6167876,3,"Ordered pizza for the office and while this location isn’t my normal go to, I was redirected to this location since it’s near my place of work. Ordered large pizza combo with salad and drink. When asked what 3 toppings we wanted, we said triple pepperoni. My usual location usually loads up on the Pepperoni since it would be considered 3 separate toppings. However, when the pizza came, it had one layer of pepperoni. I was hyping it up how good Houston’s is, don’t get me wrong the flavor was there… just very disappointed we were allowed 3 toppings and got 1 layer. I’ll be driving to the Houston pizza in my area  next time."
Houston Pizza,Pizza,"919 Albert Street Regina, SK S4R 2P6 Canada",SK,50.4636755,-104.6167876,2,Ordered lasagna from your Albert location. Wasn’t very impressed with it seems the meat sauce was forgotten or your amount you put on is extremely very little. Very disappointing!!! Made phone call was told they do put sauce on. I showed two people what it looked like and they said what the hell is that. $16.00 for just a tad of sauce noodles and cheese.  I have had far better.  First time ordering from your place and the last!!!
Houston Pizza,Pizza,"919 Albert Street Regina, SK S4R 2P6 Canada",SK,50.4636755,-104.6167876,5,They were short staffed but very kind and the food was delicious. I got the all dressed pizza and was very happy with it! The crust was nice and crispy despite having a lot of toppings.

We both ordered “The Usual”; you get a choice of egg, meat, and toast, and a side of hashbrowns for only about $10. It came hot, fresh, and soooo delicious. It was probably one of the best breakfasts we’ve had in a while. Great value for your money.

I’d eat here again!"

I have had breakfast and supper at Cravings and at this time I am not opposed to coming back for more of the menu items. So far, everything has been good.
The food has flavor, I was Impressed when I ordered my food with rice being a side, to my surprise the rice was actually flavorful unlike some places where they give you only white rice as a side."
Cravings,American (Traditional),"1883 Victoria Ave E Regina, SK S4N 6E6 Canada",SK,50.4450345,-104.5562531,4,Overall I was very happy with my meal here. Had the calamari as an appetizer. This came with homemade tatziki which was very good. I had the fettuccine Alfredo for an entree. I did go with the added chicken. The chicken wasn't bad but just didn't have much flavour. The Alfredo sauce on the other hand was quite good. I would recommend skipping the chicken on this dish. My friend had the steak sandwich. He enjoyed that as well. Only odd part about that dish was the side it came with (soup) came out with the appetizers leaving just the steak sandwich by itself on a much too large plate. I think adding something to that dish would make the plating much nicer. Even if it was just a small portion of vegetables.
Cravings,American (Traditional),"1883 Victoria Ave E Regina, SK S4N 6E6 Canada",SK,50.4450345,-104.5562531,4,"I was at Cravings to meet an old friend for lunch. The food was tasty, however, not very warm. The food came in a reasonable amount of time, was priced competitively & the waitress was very friendly & funny. The experience was good & I would go back again. Next time I may try the wing night. I had the Beef Dip & my guest had soup & salad."
Cravings,American (Traditional),"1883 Victoria Ave E Regina, SK S4N 6E6 Canada",SK,50.4450345,-104.5562531,1,"i rarely leave reviews unless it should be a warning for others, i ordered a greek skillet for i believe is 18.49. Anyway, this might as well be a dive diner based on the food, shredded hash browns , basically uncooked,( i mean they were white)@ its not what the delicious description is, it 2-3 potatoes shredded that fills almost the entire bowl, then 2-3 eggs thats just scrambled and then folded to fit in said bowl, maybe 6-10 leaves of spinach , 1 whole olive sliced, and then 2 tsps maybe of crumbled feta cheese , on top and baked to make it look great. But its just layer of hash, folded eggs then sprinkled said ingredients on top, for 3$ worth of food and 20$ price tag its, in MY opinion definitely not worth it. Marbled toast was fantastic but that was it. Oh i missed the chopped onion which couldnt have been more than 1/2 slice if that. will not return."
Cravings,American (Traditional),"1883 Victoria Ave E Regina, SK S4N 6E6 Canada",SK,50.4450345,-104.5562531,5,"Ordered the Beef Dip with a garden salad and really enjoyed both.  I would have preferred a whole wheat sub bun instead of white bun, but forgot to ask if they have before ordering.  Later, at the till I did ask and learned they don't have whole wheat buns, but they do have flax buns, which would probably have less carbs and higher fibre than the white buns.  Because I have Type 1 diabetes, I need to know how many carbs I am getting so that I can calculate how much insulin I need to take."

The sushi was very good. Tempura shrimp was very good. Salmon 🍣 was tasty. The restaurant needs to clean up the doors and windows were very dirty. If u go make sure u order sushi. That filled me up. Service was not the best. Ran out of water and ginger and wasabi. Not once but twice.

All I really like is sashimi since I don’t eat rice and stick with a very low carb diet. I put in one order at 5:58 for 12 pieces of sashimi and it didn’t arrive until 6:40! I had to go ask the front of staff where the order was twice. The lady didn’t seem to really care too much and talked to the kitchen staff. She came back and told me “later later” I did put in two more orders since I thought they might’ve missed the original order. I had to speak to her a second time,  and she grabbed the iPad from us and seemed annoyed that we kept bothering her. After speaking with the waitress directly, who was serving our table our orders finally came. I was so disappointed with the quality of the food here. The sashimi was mush and not high quality, very small bite sized pieces and I completely lost my appetite after reading some people got food poisoning here. I’m not really sure what happened to this place because back in 2014 I was a satisfied customer. The washrooms were very dirty as well. Definitely not coming back to this place ever again. Makes me really sad to write this review.  Feels like I wasted $66 on poor service and poor food."
I Love Sushi,Sushi Bars,"3622 Eastgate Drive Regina, SK S4Z 1A5 Canada",SK,50.4515056,-104.531203,5,"I Love Sushi really gives meaning to their name.
I visited them again during a very busy time, and while service was slow due to so many people ordering with limited staff working, the 30-45 minute wait time between Sushi orders is very worthwhile to me because it is so good and fresh.  But there is also a Chinese buffet that you can have between ordering or as an appetizer.
On a regular day with a few other customers,  the wait time after ordering is amazingly fast.  We ordered several different dishes and had them all served within 10 minutes.
The staff also deserve high praise, doing their best to multitask as servers, taking care of customers' needs, clearing tables and setting up for the next customer, and running the till.  All with a smile and a friendly attitude.
The quality of the food is where they really shine. Fresh ingredients, time and care in preparation, and presentation are very important, and it all shows with their sushi.  I can't wait until my next visit to this restaurant."
I Love Sushi,Sushi Bars,"3622 Eastgate Drive Regina, SK S4Z 1A5 Canada",SK,50.4515056,-104.531203,1,"As many have already commented, I will pass the comments and make a recommendation to the business owner. You can limit the total pieces of sashimi one adult can order like what Miso Ya is doing. You don’t have to use a long-waiting (45min waiting, plus thin-cut, lowing number of pieces  customer ordered) strategy to lower the service and food quality. There’s always a better way to cut the cost for your business."

We where in a little and quiet side room, which we really loved. It felt cosy.
However, the service staff didn't come very often in our room, so we sometimes had to wait a few minutes for service. They sometimes forgot to take our plates away when we finished eating. We were also advised that the portions were very small and that we needed to order more, but ended up with too much food that we couldn't finish (we both took 1 appetizer, 1 side and 1 main dish and shared 1 extra appetizer). Staff was kind, but overall, service could be improved.

We recommend booking a few days in advance.

Definitely recommend this place if you want to eat a great meal and are prepared to pay a good amount."

Seriously, though, the service here was kind and thoughtful, and the food matched the rustic decor, the reputation for which precedes this place.

Suppose the only thing the people to watch out for is, you’re gonna have a hard time coming in here if you’re over 6 1/2 feet tall, but then again, you can squeeze your way through the hallways and into the main dining room, where everything opens up and you get a nice view onto an open kitchen."

While I really enjoyed the good service and atmosphere, the food wasn't as impressive as I expected. The lobster thermidor was difficult to eat without the right cutlery and because it was just a half portion, I was left wanting. The scallop crudo was great, but I've also had better elsewhere.

Overall, great experience but just lacking a little something extraordinary."

In reality this was not true and we ended up waiting a long time, almost missing the opportunity to eat. Food was spectacular, service was lacking."

We were so impressed - everything was incredibly fresh and delicious. The service was also excellent from Hailey! We got 2 burgers (and they accommodated my lettuce bun for no charge), the cod bites, and the UNREAL chowder!"
Bernard Stanley Gastropub,Gastropubs,"223 Duckwoth Street Saint John's, NL A1C 6N1 Canada",NL,47.5669561,-52.7047114,3,"The reservation we made wasn't recorded but they got us a table. Table was by a beam so we moved to another one which was much better.

We ordered 3 appetizers and a main each. The apps were wonton nachos, bacon wrapped Buffalo chicken stuffed jalapeño poppers, and spicy shrimp. The food looked amazing and tasted amazing but the portions were a little underwhelming, especially the shrimp. 6 shrimp with sauce for $18 seems a little steep but, as I said, the flavor was fantastic. The apps took long to come out as the had originally burned our nachos and the ones we received seem to be overcooked still. It also had a lot of pulled pork and toppings under the wontons so it was basically half and half toppings to wontons.

We both ordered burgers, i got the Pierogi burger and she got the Geraldine Hot Honey Southern Fried Chicken burger. They both cane with fries and spicy ketchup which was awesome, really enjoyed the spicy ketchup. My Pierogi burger was pretty good, burger patty was a little overcooked but still juicy and well seasoned. Her burger was a little less impressive. It came with coleslaw which was large chunks of cabbage which had a bitter taste. The batter on the chicken wasn't that good either but the sauce was the best part, she didn't even finish half of it due to the coleslaw tasting so bad. Hers meal was 24 and mine was 23.

Overall, the food was fairly good but the apps pricing was a turn off. Don't think we'll be returning but it is worth a try."

I started with the strawberry fields (cocktail special) created by Danny (best bartender ever!). I had pig ears with buffalo sauce. Sooo crispy + good. I tried the duck. Delicious! Had the punch cocktail SO YUM. Overall just so so impressed by the taste and presentation of everything (the cocktails had dried flowers, so cute) and the PEOPLE! Such lovely staff and the owner Michelle is such a down to earth sweetheart! You must come here!!!!"
Chinched,Canadian (New),"5 Bates Hill St. John's, NL A1C 4B5 Canada",NL,47.5627271,-52.7104911,4,"Food has always been good, and I gave it a 5-star rating 4 years ago. However, I am back to change it to a 4-star rating now because I feel really hurt. I have celebrated my birthday three times here in the past, but this year, I am extremely disappointed. We made a reservation a week before my birthday, but when we arrived on time, the waitress informed us that they were 'busy' and seated me at a table facing the washroom. I politely requested a different seat for my birthday, but she refused to accommodate my request, not even pretending to do so. Throughout the meal, the washroom door remained open, which was highly unpleasant. Furthermore, the waitress used an uncomfortable tone while reiterating how busy they were and insisted that we finish the meal within 1.5 hours, even though we had just sat down. After placing our food order, she did not bother to check on us or inquire about the quality of the food. When she changed the water bottle, it was done hastily and with a hint of rudeness. Her fingers even touched the inside of the bottle, yet she said nothing and left it on our table. When we finished our main dishes, only one dessert arrived instead of the two we had ordered. Not wanting my partner to witness me eating the cake alone, we had to wait for someone else to check the table and inform them of our missing order. Despite the disappointing experience, we still tipped 18% for the meal. However, this birthday experience has left me deeply hurt in numerous ways. I used to love Chinched, which is why I celebrated my own and my parents' birthdays here in the past. Unfortunately, I will never go to Chinched again."
Chinched,Canadian (New),"5 Bates Hill St. John's, NL A1C 4B5 Canada",NL,47.5627271,-52.7104911,5,"Our experience at Chinched was absolutely delicious. We shared a small charcuterie and cheese board (had a pancetta, summer sausage, aged cheddar and brie) - the meats were so flavourful, the apricot compote was a great addition, and the spiced nuts were good on their own or with the meat and cheese.

We also had the cod dish and the roasted cabbage caesar based on the recommendation from our server Ivan. Not a crumb left.

Highly recommend - great service and great food!"

The food was the best we had during our trip - the Bao and Potato Wrapped Cod earned them 5 stars in its self. Our server was one of the best I've ever had, he was so personable and attentive - he even provided us with a list of other restaurants to checkout while we were in the area. We will be returning to St.Johns specifically to enjoy another meal at Chinched."

From the moment I stepped in, the warm and inviting atmosphere set the perfect tone for a memorable evening.

What truly stood out was the impeccable service provided by our server, Sarah. Her attentiveness, knowledge, and genuine passion for ensuring our dining experience was exceptional truly shone through. She went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, offering insightful recommendations and accommodating our dietary preferences with a smile.

The menu at Adelaide is a true culinary delight. The dishes we ordered were prepared with precision and skill, showcasing the chef's creativity and attention to detail. Each bite was a tantalizing explosion of flavors, leaving us wanting more.

Whether you're a local or a visitor to St. John's, I highly recommend Adelaide for an unforgettable dining experience. The exceptional service from Sarah and the rest of the staff, combined with the fantastic culinary offerings, make it a standout destination in the city.

Thank you, Adelaide, for a truly memorable evening. I can't wait to visit again and explore more"
Adelaide Oyster House,Tapas Bars,"334 Water Street St. John's, NL A1C 1C1 Canada",NL,47.5612535,-52.7107028,4,"Great cocktails and great food. A small menu and I think a couple more options would help round it out. The crispy fish tacos were a favourite amongst our group. Cauliflower share plate was also very good. If you have oysters, there was a spicy pear purée offered that was delicious if you like some heat. The only dessert option was a sticky toffee pudding, which was a bit on the dry side. The atmosphere is very cool and old comes out as it’s ready, not all at once, which adds to the relaxed, shared meal feel of this place."

The Merchant Tavern,Canadian (New),"291 Water Street St. John's, NL A1B 4B8 Canada",NL,47.5619006,-52.7094264,4,"Solid restaurant with a good tasting menu. Could improve with some slightly more experienced staff, but they were able to maintain the atmosphere. The sommelier made some good pairings, and the food was generally well prepared and tasty. Would have liked some non-menu surprises. The carrot cake was great."

The overall restaurant had a lovely ambience. I ordered the spaghetti carbonara and it was extremely delicious, with lots of cheese, creaminess and flavor. The Artic Char was incredibly delicious and tasted almost like salmon. Overall, a great option for a night out!"
The Merchant Tavern,Canadian (New),"291 Water Street St. John's, NL A1B 4B8 Canada",NL,47.5619006,-52.7094264,2,"Overall not bad but disappointing especially given the price. I don't mind paying for good food but this was simply Mediocre at best. most of the restaurants I've tried downtown have been great, but unfortunately not this one. In my opinion this tarnishes the Raymond's name. Service was speedy but I felt rushed to order.  Drink's were also heavily pushed which was unnecessary in my opinion. Atmosphere was nice but restaurant was quite loud. Appetizer was amazing which was the only good part of the evening, we had calamari. The mains lacked flavor and felt small. The chicken was kinda dry and the "" lemon Beurre blanc"" didn't really help. Thought that desert might have been able to make up for the mains but they were even more disappointing. Pastry of the Lemon tart tasted stale. I have my doubts that any of it was made in house because the meringue was no better then store bought package. THE WORST PART... I paid 12 dollars for the tiny tart which is shown in the photos. Definitely will not be back to the restaurant. Was hoping for so much better :("

The service was great and I loved the atmosphere, we especially enjoyed the open kitchen! The food was amazing, 10/10! We had the mussels as an appetizer, and had scallop risotto and steak frites as our mains.. they were all delicious!"
The Merchant Tavern,Canadian (New),"291 Water Street St. John's, NL A1B 4B8 Canada",NL,47.5619006,-52.7094264,3,"Mediocre food for the price ($125/pp); not good, but not bad. First course of local scallops, fermented gooseberries and chive oil was unbelievably sour it was a hard time attempting to finish the dish. The rest of the courses were okay, but not worth the price tag. As well, being sat at a bar was also quite uncomfortable as the bar table was much higher than the seats, making it hard to eat. I had reserved ~ 1 week prior to the visit in order to have good seating, but still got sat at the bar nonetheless. Wish it was a better experience but the first course was such a disaster it ruined the rest of the evening."
Frugal Steins,Seafood,"318 Water Street St. John's, NL A1C 1B8 Canada",NL,47.5615712,-52.7105225,4,Busy Friday night. Got a table easily. Service was good but they didn't clear our empty dishes from the table for quite a while. They brought food the food out within a decent time. Food was good. We had a delicious juicy moose burger with pickled beets. It was delicious. The jiggs muscles were good. We got an order of 2 lbs. Our black forest cheesecake was scrumptious.

Nachos with pulled pork, sauerkraut and dill pickles - who knew it would be a winning combination? The red curry mussels were ok. Quite a wait considering the restaurant wasn't super busy but we enjoyed ourselves."
Piatto,Italian,"377 Duckworth Street St John's, NL A1C 1H7 Canada",NL,47.562362,-52.7102323,3,"Came here for the first time the other night. We were seated quickly, our server was friendly, it was clean inside.

I wasn’t a huge fan of the orange creamsicle drink. The tomato sauce on the pacchi di proscuitto was really tart. The Stephanie pizza was good and my smash burger was decent. I don’t think it was worth $80 though."
Piatto,Italian,"377 Duckworth Street St John's, NL A1C 1H7 Canada",NL,47.562362,-52.7102323,5,"The pizza was delicious, the staff is kind, and the atmosphere is very nice with the open kitchen area and the dim lighting & candles.

Piatto,Italian,"377 Duckworth Street St John's, NL A1C 1H7 Canada",NL,47.562362,-52.7102323,5,"Their pizzas are truly DELICIOUS!
The best one I've ever had.
We've had the one with honey/prosciutto and one with blue cheese & mushrooms. Both were very tasty.
You can really feel the authenticity from Italia. The pizzas are cooked in a wood oven which is great. The incredients on the pizzas are sparse which makes every bite taste different. The cooks seemed to be having fun and if you're seating at the bar, you can watch the preparation.
We didn't try their pasta but they looked freshly made.
You should definitely go

Edit. I went again to try their pastas and wow. It was DELICIOUS. I had the rigatoni with the lemon ricotta (chef's kiss). LOVE this place."
Piatto,Italian,"377 Duckworth Street St John's, NL A1C 1H7 Canada",NL,47.562362,-52.7102323,5,"I absolutely loved the pizza! It is my favourite that I’ve ever had. Highly recommended for sure! My boyfriend had pasta there and he loved it as well. I got the Margarita with added Pepperoni and I absolutely fell in love with it. It’s so delicious, juicy and full of flavour.

The best pizza I’ve ever had in my life and nice atmosphere too.

Highly recommended!"
Piatto,Italian,"377 Duckworth Street St John's, NL A1C 1H7 Canada",NL,47.562362,-52.7102323,5,"Best pizza ever! Waiter was very efficient. We ate outside and traffic was busy so the exhaust from cars was not great, but the food made up for it."
Saltwater Restaurant,Seafood,"320 Water Street St. John's, NL A1C 1C1 Canada",NL,47.561479,-52.7106021,3,Ordinary food at extraordinary price. The post disappointing if all is the lobster which is small and meatless for a high price. While the cod fish was good I do not know what the hype of this restaurant is about. Noted this is the most disappointment meal of our 5 day trip in NL. The biggest factor that drove this mediocre rating is that they cannot even do the fries right. It is greasy and soggy soaked in oil. Very disappointing
Saltwater Restaurant,Seafood,"320 Water Street St. John's, NL A1C 1C1 Canada",NL,47.561479,-52.7106021,5,"I was hesitant after reading some of the reviews but went for it. And I cannot be more thrilled that I did! Our server, Russell, was the ABSOLUTE best. Fun and attentive and just top notch all around. We had the chowder and burger and oysters and lobster roll. After living in Boston and Florida for fifteen years, I can say that this was HANDS DOWN the best lobster roll I have ever had, and I am what some would call a food snob. I would recommend to ANYONE."
Saltwater Restaurant,Seafood,"320 Water Street St. John's, NL A1C 1C1 Canada",NL,47.561479,-52.7106021,4,"Okayyyy, this restaurant is 👌. Great atmosphere. Our server recommended the bruschetta and it was absolutely to die for. I've never had such delicious bruschetta before! I had the seafood chowder, and while it was quite tasty my only criticism is that it didn't have a variety of seafood in it (no mussels or shrimp, just white fish which I'm assuming was cod), so it should be called cod chowder instead. The food is on the more expensive end, but I would definitely recommend."
Saltwater Restaurant,Seafood,"320 Water Street St. John's, NL A1C 1C1 Canada",NL,47.561479,-52.7106021,5,"We had a great experience! Food was great, and we thought very reasonably priced. Atmosphere and service also top notch! Will def be back. Nice cocktail menu, too - original and well priced."
Saltwater Restaurant,Seafood,"320 Water Street St. John's, NL A1C 1C1 Canada",NL,47.561479,-52.7106021,3,"I have to say I think Saltwater needs to be rebranded. If you are a local in St.John’s you'll remember the Saltwater on Duckworth. After the move to Water street I'm sure the chef and owners have changed and if not that the brand or audience they are attracting is not the same as when they were on Duckworth.

My family and I were celebrating a birthday / early mother's day. We ordered a fair amount of food. Or server was very sweet and helpful when we ran in to food issues. So 4 stars for that only issue it was not 5 is because service includes the Kitchen in my eyes.

Drinks:
Elderflower fields martini - sweet elderflower does come through. 5/5
Cesar - Classic Cesar, it's good! 4/5
I forget the name but it's the spicy margarita on the menu - really nice, refreshing, wish there was more of a salt rim. 4/5

Apps:
Mussles - plump, but over cooked, not much broth, and underseasoned.
Wings - I actually really liked the breaded wings I thought they were 5/5!
Pork belly - Kinda funny but maybe a bit too honest. Our server apologized for the wait on this dish, due to the fact that the chef slipped and dropped our original pork belly on the floor. She quickly offered a discount on our meal and it came out maybe 7 mins later.

Mains:
Seafood risotto -
Came with mussles scallops and shrimp I believe. My dad had it and the read was average. Not over done but nothing to make you want to order it again.

Cod with Beet salad -
My mom raved about this dish she was it was excellent!

Steak-
unfortunately my brother's steak was over cooked. Again our server noticed without us having to say anything. This was due to her own experience cooking at home, she visually saw the cook was over. Following this she offered to have another one made or give us a discount. My brother opted to keep the one made already due to food waste and time. The garnish and flavours on this dish were very delicious!

Salmon with Beet salad-
When I got the plate I realized I am particular about salmon and probably should of asked more questions. The salmon was over cooked and the skin was kinda soft which I personally really like salmon skin crispy or with a hard sear. Maybe it was just personal preferance but I really didn't like the cook on it. The fish was just not handled well. Again simular to the steak the cook not on par but the flavours of the sauce and seasoning were great!The Beet Salad on the side was a vanilla dressing with goat cheese.

Dessert:
Baklava 5/5 so good made with walnuts and you can tell it's a home recipe!

Overall:

I think the place can do really well as a relaxed seafood restaurant. I think the pub food options are awesome for students to get some food before going out! Theres a wonderful atmosphere with the arches and long tables thay give a cozy casual feel. I also would tell anyone that the wings are good. The only downfall is the price for what you get. I wouldn't want to pay for food overcooked or not paid attention too. I think sorting out a clear focus on what kind of restaurant this is now will help. An updated about us online will bring in more people in the upcoming summer Season for tourists. Now a days online presence is so important. I'm excited to go back with a few friends and try more of the pub food when I get around to it!"

I went recently with my girlfriend. It wasn't very busy at all. The food took about 30-40 minutes to come out. Our server was very friendly, kind, and attentive, so I didn't really mind that wait.

I got fish and chips and my girlfriend got the steak and cheese sandwich. Her sandwich was tasty, just very oily, which is a little off putting. My fish and chips were below average as well, with only getting a few fries that were luke warm, and the fish just tasted bad, the batter wasn't crunchy and  just came right off the fish. Shame

The prices here have gotten ridiculous as well. You're better off going to yellowbelly or somewhere else nearby, you'll get more food, that's much better and fresher, and cheaper!

I hope this restaurant can turn things around but in my opinion it's just not worth going, especially at the inflated prices."

It had the Irish pub vibe, friendly service. They had gf toast options but don’t order the ham with the breakfast - there was more fat and grizzle than ham - bacon or sausage options looked better. When we asked if the hash browns were gf, we were told “no problem” but got our Celtic breakfast and the home made hash browns, which were good, came 20 minutes later 🙃 it wasn’t busy and our server was very nice. Good coffee here as well. Pricey for a breakfast at &17.95 pp, plus lovey 15% tax and tip makes for an expensive but typical breakfast."

The service and atmosphere here are always great, but my main issue is the massive increase in pricing. Prices in the past two years have gone up nearly half, and it's honestly ridiculous - not to mention portion sizes. I went here today, and the food was decent (I've only had one bad experience here with taste), but it was almost insulting how little you get for the price. They used to give you a full basket of fries that would fill you up by themself, but now it pretty much amounts to what would be in a small McDonald's fries."

The staff is amazing.  I haven't experienced this level of attentiveness in many years.  Thank you, Victoria (and others) for making us feel so special.  The bathroom in our room was to die for.  We loved the heated floor and the beds were so comfortable.
If there is any room for improvement, it is the coffee supplied in the room.   All three of us joked and called it coffee water - even though it was a specialty company who supplied it.   I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel  - if only to remind people of what true customer service is all about."
Blue On Water,Breakfast & Brunch,"319 Water Street St John's, NL A1C 1B9 Canada",NL,47.5614295,-52.710147,5,"A local friend recommended Blue and it was a pricey but wonderful location for exploring St Johns. We were in room 201 so facing the street. The room was large, comfortable and had a fridge, tv - although odd channels- coffee station and an amazing bathroom! Despite many ceiling lights, the lighting in the bathroom is terrible. I found opening the drapes and standing in front of the long mirror was the only place I could see to put on makeup. The sounds from George Street do find their way to you until 2:00am. Parking was on a roof a block away and cost an additional $20 a night.  There are many restaurants, pubs, coffee and various shops within walking distance. We had one evening meal in Blues restaurant: chicken tacos, scallops and a chowder. It was fine but we didn’t go back for more. They were very good to accommodate a gluten free request and every server was friendly, helpful and pleasant whether helping with luggage, serving a meal or checking us out of the hotel."

I’m partial to their Chinese food but the fish and chips or the hot turkey sandwich are great as well. Drop by and give it a try. You won’t be disappointed.

I want to like it, but the ramen broth is just okay for the price. On the cold day I visited, the room was wear-your-coat-indoors chilly."
Bad Bones Ramen,Ramen,"178 Water St St. John's, NL A1C 1A9 Canada",NL,47.5649269,-52.706555,5,Exceeded my expectations. We ordered the Pork Tantanmen and Pork Belly Shoyu. Both had plenty of pork and a good amount of noodles and vegetables. Also added the homemade hot sauce which was sweet and spicy. It's not quite traditional but was quite good. Service was good and efficient for having only one person on staff for the whole restaurant. Decor was familiar for a ramen restaurant with the menu on a wall chalkboard and benches along the wall and chairs on the other side. Would definitely recommend.

I only managed to take one picture after I had already taken a few bites.. it was too good to wait! lol"

Nourish Bakery,Bakeries,"1304 Topsail Road Paradise, NL A1L 1N9 Canada",NL,47.5343513,-52.8398132,5,"Had a great experience at Ocean Sushi! So far, this is our favorite sushi spot since arriving to Newfoundland.

Very pleased with the various options on the menu for different kinds of seafood. We went with the Salmon 5 Ways platter, Crispy Spicy Crab rolls, calamari appetizer, octopus sashimi, and butterfish sashimi.

All of the cuts of fish were extremely generous. The rolls had the perfect ratio of rice to meat. The batter on the calamari was light and crispy, and the calamari weren't rubbery on the inside.

We were also happy that there was a low sodium soya sauce option for dipping. The flavors and spices used throughout were delicious.

Our server was very attentive, and checked back often. We didn't finish a glass of water or a drink before he came over to ask if we needed more.

Will definitely be regulars here. Thank you!"
Nourish Bakery,Bakeries,"1304 Topsail Road Paradise, NL A1L 1N9 Canada",NL,47.5343513,-52.8398132,5,"We stopped here for one last taste of fresh fish before flying out of Newfoundland, and it did not disappoint! The servers were exceptionally pleasant and attentive, every piece of sushi was delicious - some were just more delicious than others. Ive never encountered asparagus sushi before trying Ocean and it was a really fun and tasty new one for me.

Great location too, great bathrooms and great atmosphere. Whenever i am back in Newfoundland i will be stopping back in here."
Nourish Bakery,Bakeries,"1304 Topsail Road Paradise, NL A1L 1N9 Canada",NL,47.5343513,-52.8398132,5,"Their lunch menu is fantastic with some great deals. Food is fresh and with some newer combinations of flavours, it is delicious. I'm from West Coast where there are loads of sushi snobs, this place is better than a majority of any other places I've ever been to.

It is insanely good! Very nice quantities for an insane price. The lunch special is also crazy, with 3 standard rolls costing less than $20!!! That includes Miso soup too! Great location and on skip as well. Ample parking and never had a problem getting a table. If you're in St John's and want sushi, this is hands down the best spot of them all. The dynamite roll is sublime!"
Nourish Bakery,Bakeries,"1304 Topsail Road Paradise, NL A1L 1N9 Canada",NL,47.5343513,-52.8398132,5,"There is something special about the sushi here.  Not only is the sushi and sashimi fresh and made to order but they also offer a torched ""Aburi"" variety that sears the fish and adds a bit of charred smokiness giving it an extra boost of complexity.  There is an add-on cost to this technique but if you're looking for something different, give it a try.

The first time I was there, we had the sushi and sashimi combo for 2 and a fried calamari appetizer.  Although the fried calamari was good, it was similar to what you can get at any Steakhouse restaurant.  2nd time I was there, I had the grilled calamari and it is 100x better.  Cooked tender, not chewy, very umami.

It is my new favorite casual sushi spot in the St. John's area."

Locally owned. Food is fresh and delicious. $12 for a small wrap. Small town feel and decor. Right on the water street strip. Was busy with customers ordering for take-out. Inside seating less busy. Could be a bit cleaner inside...floors, windows and tea ceremony table. Otherwise a nice place to get freshly made good food."

Sushi Island,Japanese,"210 Water Street Saint John's, NL A1C 1A9 Canada",NL,47.5639039,-52.7076701,4,"My husband and I did the All You Can Eat at Sushi Island and it was decent overall! The All You Can Eat menu is great if you want to try different dishes. They do charge for sushi and dishes not finished (2$/roll, 7$/plate for a dish) but will let you take it home.

The fried wontons were a little overcooked and lacking filling. The sushi rolls were not cut evenly, but the food was fresh and rice was sticky.

We wanted to order sashimi, but didn't see it on the menu during lunch (12:00pm). It did appear to be sold later in the day.

Service was good. They do have ""server"" robots that bring your food to you. The server we had did some around to check on us a few times as well."
Sushi Island,Japanese,"210 Water Street Saint John's, NL A1C 1A9 Canada",NL,47.5639039,-52.7076701,5,"The food is absolutely delicious and, in all seriousness, I have to say that it’s the best service I’ve ever received at any restaurant. The staff members are so nice and they all seem very genuine. My mother and I go fairly frequently, admittedly to the point that we get recognized by most. The quality of the food is consistant and the prices are amazing. We always get the $40 combo thing they offer and honestly, it’s such a steal that it feels criminal. You get two drinks (pop), two extra sauces, four appetizer-like things (soup and salad), four rolls of sushi, and three side dishes. They offer complimentary ice cream at the end of your meal if it’s available and ginger and wasabi are both free as well. The combo feeds 2-3 people. Also, they have robotic cats that bring you food and, I promise, seeing them and getting to pet the robocat is enough to make grown adults squeal like children. It’s seriously so fun. The atmosphere is wonderful and the walls are covered in beautiful murals. I know this review sounds like I’m being paid to write this but I’m genuinely not, I just love it that much. I have literally nothing to say about the place except for glowing praise. If you’re in the St. John’s area and you like sushi or would like to try it, I’d highly recommend you go.

- seaweed salad
- black dragon roll
- spicy tuna roll

We got two of the daily specials, vegetarian and non. Every bite was packed full of flavour and so delicious. The naan bread was a treat and the samosas were good as well.

I got the chance today and I was not disappointed at all! Loved the sushi and the tempura I had! It was nothing less than authentic and was absolutely delicious!

I would like one thing changed though. I would like a bit more lighting in the dining area, as it was a bit too dark."

Everything was quite nice, particularly nigiri and the blueberry mojito. Their sushi rolls were good but I have had better at another restaurant in the Avalon area. A friend who had surf n’ turf & pan seared seasonal white fish confirmed that they were both great. (They looked great too).
A good thing about Basho is that you can get gluten free appetisers, mains and desserts.
Ambiance of the restaurant is amiable and the staff is not bad either."

Sushi Nami Royale,Japanese,"36 George Street Saint John's, NL A1C 1M3 Canada",NL,47.5606104,-52.7118895,2,"I had the teriyaki chicken meal with an honey avocado salad. The salad was not wring properly so the mixing it the bowl made the honey avocado taste watered down. The chicken was white meat and overcooked. It was just warm so I got a feeling it's not freshly made and was just kept warm. The teriyaki sauce was good though. The place was pretty empty, but it was a Monday night. I was seated close to the sushi bar and heard all the staff's conversations as they were speaking pretty loudly. My soup and salad came first and 3 minutes later my entrée came. I didn't have time to finish my appetizers. Plus my table had traces of dried sauce, nobody ever came back to ask how was my food nor did they come back to fill my water or tea. I had to raise my hand to get someone to come over and I had get up afterwards to pay at the cash since I don't want to have to raise my hand again to get the check. Very disappointed on everything. Not going back until they train their staff better. This is the worst restaurant I've been to in a long time."
Sushi Nami Royale,Japanese,"36 George Street Saint John's, NL A1C 1M3 Canada",NL,47.5606104,-52.7118895,4,"I'll give a 4 stars for service, but the food is about 3 stars as I loved their fusion of Japanese to sit Western tastes, but the really should arrive for keeping it Japanese as so many people, I included, have been there and people who has had real Japanese food live it more than the stuff you find at home. So if you've never been to Japan, this place is the best, but if you're like me I think the best options are the basic 🍣 and their Ramen. Alcohol is a bit expensive so keep that in mind too."

Did I say free?? :) Also, the washroom was the best I have seen in a sushi restaurant. 👍👍 I might come back and try the fish."

After sitting on a plane, this simple to the point meal was perfect. I didn't leave feeling heavy or hungry. I loved it even more after finding out that they do this as a social enterprise to help vulnerable adults and help get them into the food service industry.

The service was really good and the food and atmosphere is perfect. There is a small outside area to eat but we just sat inside by the window. It's a lovely cafe to have lunch. We didn't need reservations or have to wait in line and came in 30 minutes before they were expected to close. We never felt rushed or like we were being waited for. I would say the cost is acceptable and for the cause, I would say that it is well worth paying for.

Would definitely return to have lunch."
Hungry Heart Cafe,Coffee & Tea,"142 Military Road St John's, NL A1C 2E7 Canada",NL,47.5688355,-52.7085483,3,"I'm gonna give an objective review since I'm not from NL and because I've only been there once.

The cafe in itself is cute with a warm ambiance.

First I was disappointed because I expected them to offer a variety of coffee like espresso but they only have regular filter coffee which isn't bad.

Then, the service wasn't bad, but it was kinda strange.. From what I could grasp, I think employees there are being rehabilitated to society by being offered a job at this cafe by the church. Please, tell me if I'm wrong.
I think it's great! More places should do this. But like I said it was kinda strange.. I think one of the server didn't like my boyfriend and he was giving him weird intense looks. I had to point it out.

Then, the food was good. I had the applebutter grilled cheese. But the portion is too small for the price.

I can't give a better rating because of these reasons. I'm still glad I tried it."

The fresh little flower vase was a nice touch. The food is alright. Although it's unique, it's a little bit pricey. I liked the Mimosas here. Tried the soft shell moose tacos and breakfast on the bun with potatoes and salad. The dessert was delicious. The covid protocols are being practiced and the tables spread apart."

The food tasted old, felt like rubber and was in very small portion for the price paid. A breakfast with one egg (so cooked it was like rubber), some veggies (boiled tomatoes and spinach)  and old potatoes cost $16 plus tax and tips. The waiter made us feel very uncomfortable and reached at us a couple of times. I am unsure what that was about but I will give them the benefit of the doubt. All in all a bad experience. DO NOT RECOMMEND."

We were seated by a lovely hostess. Our server Miranda came straight away to offer drinks and advise us of the specials. She gave the appropriate amount of attention, genuine, and not pushy. She told me it was her first time making my sangria. It was perfect! My husband and I had the steak. My Dad had the ribs and wings. My compliments to the back of house team. My steak was perfect! A beautiful rare steak isn't easy, but mine was melt in your mouth delicious. The chili sauce over the shrimp was so tasty.  For the desert they indulged in the cheesecake and I enjoyed the churro fries. They were good, but would be better with the chocolate.
All in all the food was great but everything was enhanced by Miranda's five star service. She was fantastic and I hope she sees this."
Kelseys Original Roadhouse,American (Traditional),"302 Kenmount Rd St. John's, NL A1B 3R2 Canada",NL,47.5513324,-52.7778542,5,Was at Kelsey’s and ordered a full rack of ribs. I did the rib and wing combo. The ribs were succulent and the wings cooked to perfection. We had the best service we could ask for. The waitress was kind and very accommodating. The service at Kelsey’s is definitely worth the stop. Ask for Erin O and the service will be unmatched!

We were a large group of 14 and she didn’t miss a beat.  She was warm, friendly and efficient. She kept track of all our orders and I was very impressed with how fast we were all able to pay  separately. If you go, ask for Brittany."
The Sprout Restaurant,Vegetarian,"364 Duckworth St St. John's, NL A1C 1H5 Canada",NL,47.5629571,-52.70967,5,I am glad that I went there as the food is exceptionally delicious!! I was happy to see that there are places which offer pure vegetarian &  egan food. Order Teriyaki Bowl and it was portioned well with brown rice. I wish that dining area was bit more option but not at big issue.

We dined in the restaurant which has several cozy tables indoors as well as outdoor seating. We had the burrito and ""chicken"" tacos both made vegan. They are not kidding about the spice on the habanero sauce, but that is to be expected and it was great. The burrito was delicious and filling. We often struggle to find vegan options when we travel but this place was great. We were stuffed so we didn't have dessert but they had several vegan and gluten free sweets on offer as well."

The menu selection is massive, and everything I've tried so far was delicious. On our last visit the lineup wasn't bad, but began to lineup after we'd been seated, you definitely want to get there early on weekends, this is one of the most popular places downtown for breakfast and the wait times can reflect that."

Bagel Cafe,Breakfast & Brunch,"246 Duckworth Street St. John's, NL A1C 1G6 Canada",NL,47.566814,-52.705286,5,"Ordered the mushroom, spinach, cheese open omelette and it was huge. No paper thin omelette here, more like an inch thick for just the egg. There had to be like half a dozen eggs in it. Very tasty. Also ordered the touton breakfast sandwich with bacon, egg, and cheese with a side of molasses and hash browns. Another large meal and also very good. A lot of dough though. Only issue is that there are no drinks on the menu. Ordered a coffee which came in a large cup but was also $4.85. I would also go directly to the website to look at the menu for pricing, Google Maps menu link, deep links to an old version of the menu and older prices. Service was quick and efficient by both the host and wait staff. The atmosphere is definitely ""cozy"" and quaint. Small pathways and low ceilings and some unique small booths for two. We got a small booth right beside the front window which was nice. Overall good food, good service, and good value for money."

For breakfast, we ordered Harborside Big hardy breakfast, the dish is huge, it's too much for one person. So we shared it and added two bowls of yogurt with fruit. It's the best breakfast we had in St John's. For dinner, we had two lobsters. The lobsters were steamed, cooked at right level very fresh and taste delicious."

PS. Do not miss their addictive chocolate mints which they so generously plied me with!"

Their outdoor eating area wad blocked and busy during the Pedestrian Mall. I went inside and sat at the bar. It was about 10 minutes to be served and 20 minutes to receive food. I ordered the  loaded street fries and a Corona. They could have been great except the fries were cut very small, something in the dish was extremely salty and the jalapeños were candied (not hot and very sweet). I didn't eat it all as  the meal was too salty. The Corona (on tap)was enjoyable and the bartender was nice though."
Magnum & Steins,Canadian (New),"329 Duckworth Street St. John's, NL A1C 1H3 Canada",NL,47.5640829,-52.7079149,5,"We were blown away. Food was perfectly done. Dasha was our server and she was excellent, giving just the right amount of attention, but friendly and welcoming. I fear we closed the restaurant after two bottles of wine and she never made us feel rushed.

But the food! Everything we had was perfect, from the calamari to the crème brûlée. We had a delicious lobster and even the julienned vegetables were perfect! Imagine taking the care to make veggies delicious under a lobster!

I’m kind of glad we found this place at the end of our trip because any other restaurant would have paled in comparison."
Magnum & Steins,Canadian (New),"329 Duckworth Street St. John's, NL A1C 1H3 Canada",NL,47.5640829,-52.7079149,3,"Well, we have been dining at Magnum & Steins, off and on, for 20 or more years. Experiences have always been super but tonight’s was a bit of a downer. We went for the advertised Happy Hour and from the outset it was more ‘hijack hour’.  Maybe I don’t get out enough but happy hours to me imply 2 for 1 specials or similar. The red wine special tonight was Tripache Malbec 5 oz glass regular price of $9.50 for the low, low price $8.75 [And there was no pan fried Cod option to boot]. I understand that the restaurant business is tough but in my opinion you need to build in a little more Joy into the pricing of your advertised Happy Hour specials."
Magnum & Steins,Canadian (New),"329 Duckworth Street St. John's, NL A1C 1H3 Canada",NL,47.5640829,-52.7079149,4,"My partner and I enjoyed dinner at Magnum and Steins last night and it was fantastic. We had the duck nachos to start which were highly recommended by friends and they did not disappoint, definitely the highlight of the night! For mains I had the fish of the night, which was a cod dish. The dish was prepared very well. My partner had the pasta of the night, which was a chicken based pasta dish which was quite good! For desert we had the chocolate flourless torte which was superb. Our server Laura was friendly, helpful but a bit slow at points, however she had many tables. She gave us great recommendations, and even surprised us with our mains and wine pairings. The restaurant was clean, and the atmosphere was intimate. Would recommend"
Magnum & Steins,Canadian (New),"329 Duckworth Street St. John's, NL A1C 1H3 Canada",NL,47.5640829,-52.7079149,2,"Not fussy.

We had reservations at 7 but we're able to get in at 645 and take advantage of the happy hour specials. She ordered a Starburst martini while I sipped on a long Island ice tea.

We ordered appetizers, duck confit nachos and the potato skins. They tasted great but the nachos were quite small and the potato skins are literally 3 halves of potatoes.

Pretty sure we were the youngest people there besides the servers, the next youngest person after myself looked to be 15 years older. We felt very out of place. The menu was also minimal but didn't have so many options different outside of most restaurants locally.

The meal of two drinks and two appetizers came out to about $50, the drinks were as expensive as the aps. Their wine menu was quite extensive except we aren't wine drinkers so this probably isn't the place for us.

I don't think we'll be returning any time soon, there is literally nothing else on their menu I would like to try that I can't have anywhere else."

Pi,Pizza,"10 King's Road St John's, NL A1C 3P1 Canada",NL,47.5682728,-52.7039097,3,"We ordered the Fibonacci and Sir Isaac Salmon pizzas. It was our first time having Fibonacci and we really liked it! However, the Sir Isaac Salmon pizza wasn’t as good as the previous time we had it. The crust was delicious but the fish was salty and not smoky enough.

We got take out because the inside of the restaurant had a bit of cigarette smell and the atmosphere is not that cozy."
Pi,Pizza,"10 King's Road St John's, NL A1C 3P1 Canada",NL,47.5682728,-52.7039097,2,"Pi Pizza until tonight was my favourite. Always order Prime Colours. Not sure what has happened, the crust has changed, it’s very doughy now, and let’s face it the crust makes it breaks your pizza. While the toppings were mostly liberal, I had to hunt for the bacon. Overall it was rather tasteless. I asked for their hot oil sauce and got some kind of hot tomato base sauce. The pizza was also not hot or even warm despite the fact that we picked it up on time. Their online menu said the cost was $30 plus $2 extra for the sauce yet we got charged $42.

Anyway perhaps their recipe has changed or their pizza maker whatever the reason sadly I won’t be going back."

It is very picturesque  and relaxing.  The service was great."
The Keg Steakhouse + Bar,Bars,"127 Harbour Drive Bishops Cove Landing St. John's, NL A1C 6N6 Canada",NL,47.5607934,-52.7093221,5,"The warm hospitality and inviting atmosphere set the stage for an unforgettable meal.

Let's start with the star of the show - the steaks. Keg's Steakhouse truly lives up to its reputation as a steak lover's paradise. The menu boasted an impressive selection of prime cuts, each cooked perfectly. I opted for a juicy steak, cooked medium-rare, and it arrived at my table with a mouthwatering sear and a tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture. The quality of the Steak was evident in every bite, and the expert seasoning beautifully enhanced the flavours. This was one of the best steaks I have ever had the pleasure of eating.

The service at Keg's Steakhouse was top-notch. The staff was knowledgeable, attentive, and genuinely passionate about ensuring a memorable dining experience. From offering recommendations to promptly refilling glasses, they were always one step ahead, ensuring I wanted nothing throughout the meal. In addition, the waitstaff's friendly demeanour added a personal touch to the evening, making me feel like a valued guest rather than just another customer.

The restaurant's ambiance was elegant and sophisticated, with dim lighting, cozy booths, and tasteful decor. It was the perfect setting for an intimate dinner or a celebratory gathering. The noise level was well-controlled, allowing for comfortable conversation without feeling overwhelmed by the surrounding buzz."

The food was hot, delicious, generous in portion size and our server was very attentive.  We will definitely be returning!"
The Keg Steakhouse + Bar,Bars,"127 Harbour Drive Bishops Cove Landing St. John's, NL A1C 6N6 Canada",NL,47.5607934,-52.7093221,3,"Not as good as we expected. We arrived at 4:45 PM for an early dinner and we were told there was no server before 5:30 PM. So, we ended up having a drink at the bar. They have a good selection of beers and wine. The bloody ceasar is filled with ice in a small glass. So, not a big drink, you got a couple of sip.

I don't recommend the burger there. It was very dry. Fries were good. Friends with steak said they were very good, but one of them was overcooked.

Long story short, I think you can get a better taste somewhere else for the same amount."
MAGIC WOK EATERY,Chinese,"402 - 408 Water Street St. John's, NL A1C 1C9 Canada",NL,47.558556,-52.7119924,1,"We used to eat at this restaurant all the time and get excellent service. Since Covid the service kept going downhill every time we placed an order. Today we placed an order, and when we showed up, my husband was given one order instead of two. The staff argued with him and myself, saying that we only placed one order and their staff was right not me. I asked him what would I gain by showing up to pick up two orders when there was only one ready? We ordered there that much they would have known our orders previously and known that we have never placed one order. We always place the exact same order all the time.. so instead of saying that the person on the phone was mistaken, they just argued with me and said no, it was me that was wrong. Then she wondered why I wouldn’t take that food that was ready and wait for more to be made so I could have one order of food half cold. I asked to have two orders made, and they refused. Needless to say, it will be my last order placed ever there. The staff is rude, not friendly at all. Even the food itself has gone downhill since Covid started. There was absolutely no one in the store, picking up an order or eating in at this time, so I think this should tell them to treat people better. It’s not worth my time ordering from a place that calls me a liar about my own order. I think I remember what I ordered."

The deep fried BBQ pork bun had a lot of flavour but I thought it would be bigger.

The sweet & sour pork was spot on but it was strange that it tomatoes instead of red pepper in it. But it was still tasty overall.

The egg roll was flavoursome. I liked it.

The crispy wonton was wonton sheets deep fried. It wasn't deep fried wonton balls with shrimp & pork in it. But it was still good with the sauce.

The coconut pudding was a coconut filling in batter, deep fried and dusted with icing sugar. It was sweet to end the meal.

The restaurant had a great atmosphere and the service was good too. I would come back here and try other dishes on the menu."

Boston Pizza,Pizza,"367 Water Street St. John's, NL A1C 1C2 Canada",NL,47.559563,-52.7111218,1,"Ordered delivery last night. Price was outrageous- 2 pizzas, garlic bread and 6 pops for over $100... plus they forgot to send our drinks, said they could do anything about it when we called about it. I asked to talk to the manager who apparently wasn't there that day and was told they would call me back the next day to refund the drinks... never did hear back. Extremely disappointed.  I get people make mistakes, but then they should do what they can to fix it."

They have lost their flavors the lamb I ordered was cooked separately from the sauce it should have been stewed in the soup was the same thing  chicken added after the soup was poured. Honestly in my opinion it was not much better then something from a food court. The restaurant is very nice but I wanted a better meal. When we got our bill they informed us the tip of 15% was included in our total I discovered later that we tipped the hst amount as well. Not happy and won't be going back.
India Gate Restaurant,Indian,"286 Duckworth Street St. John's, NL A1C 1H3 Canada",NL,47.5656179,-52.7069691,2,Food was nice service was good. The food was overpriced and then at the end to find out there was a mandatory tip was very disappointing. If we were 2 tables of 2 we wouldn't have had an extra 60 dollars added to the bill. If they can't handle serving 4 people at once maybe a new career is needed. Won't be going back.

The decor of the restaurant looks quite beautiful and relaxing (although very old fashioned which may not be everyones taste). Our server was very sweet to us and the food was honestly delicious! I had a chickpea tomota curry kind of dish (forget the actual name) and my date enjoyed a stir fry. Both were large in portion sizing and were very good!

If so -it is broken. Also seems they are always understaffed giving one person all responsibilities (host, bar, server, cashier) - who is not to blame. The staff member has always been patient and friendly. The serving sizes are ok - prices high (being in a hotel I suspect). Ordering the prime rib medium rare gets you well done. Salmon is always well over cooked too. I can say the Seafood Chowder is awesome - however - again a bit overpriced. Done giving them chances."

We were seated promptly, and our server was very attentive. Drinks came quickly. Food arrived promptly. The mussels were delicious and the wings were tasty. Our entrees lacked flavor, were pretty bland and forgettable. Overall service was great and the food was ok."

They have a new menu that, as far as I am aware of, is fantastic. Everyone in my party of 4 enjoyed their meal. The only complaint was an overly greasy onion ring out of 2 apps, 4 entrés and 1 dessert; which brings me to the apple pie and ice cream which was amazing. Hot pie and cold ice cream, ""after"" photo attached."

Green Sleeves,Pubs,"12-14 George Street St. John's, NL A1C 1L9 Canada",NL,47.5618868,-52.7108822,5,Little pub/bar on George Street. 5 for $25 beer or seltzer are great deal. Only problem is when sitting on the patio is you are getting the music from Green Sleeves as well as martini bar across the street and the  street stage just down the street. It was very annoying hearing 3 competing different songs at once. We had to leave cause it was too hard on the head. Probably be fine if you are sitting inside.

(We are not vegans) We found this place from online reviews about local favourites in town and this place did not disappoint.  The owner Loi is so kind and generous and immediately served us with tea and soup upon sitting. We ordered the squash roll and shanghai noodles and a rice dish. Each dish was full of flavour and complimentary home made sauce was provided to add to your liking. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone, vegan or not, local or traveller. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did!"

Peaceful Loft Vegetarian Restaurant,Vegan,"250 Duckworth Street Saint John's, NL A1C Canada",NL,47.5667698,-52.7054727,5,"Coming from Toronto, I didn’t expect good Chinese food in Newfoundland. However, I have to give this place 5*!! The owner of this restaurant is super friendly. I can tell he loves what he does. He greeted us with a big smile, served us like we are his family.

Peaceful Loft Vegetarian Restaurant,Vegan,"250 Duckworth Street Saint John's, NL A1C Canada",NL,47.5667698,-52.7054727,5,"This may be the best Chinese food you will find in Atlantic Canada, let alone in St. John's. They make traditional Chinese dishes, while substituting meat with their own house-made meat substitutes made with soy, gluten, etc. The flavours are detailed and so beautifully rich, staying true to the flavours of the original dish - e.g. soy fish made with seaweed to give it an ocean flavour, or gluten marinated and grilled like char siu BBQ pork. You'll also get free house-made sauces which vary by the day, free soup, and free green tea. The portions are great, and the prices are great - less than $20 for nearly all dishes. All of this comes from the pure passion the old couple from Macau have for their art. The man (server) is a retired engineer in his 70s who opened the restaurant just to express his craft and not for any profit motives. The space is decorated with beautiful art and wise calligraphy, showing all that the couple has learned through their life. I have nothing but the utmost respect for them, and I highly recommend that everyone finding themselves in St. John's tries this food whether they are vegan or not!"

Wok Box,Asian Fusion,"55 A-1 Kelsey Dr St John's, NL A1B 5C8 Canada",NL,47.5529235,-52.7817078,3,"The smell coming from this place was phenomenal. I ordered chicken Pad Thai with chow mein, Mongolian beef and broccoli on rice, and butter chicken on rice. The Mongolian beef was our favorite by far despite the broccoli being almost raw. The beef is tender and I really like the sweet sauce. The Pad Thai tastes too strongly of tamarind for us, unfortunately. The butter chicken was ok but I wouldn't get again. We were not fans of the texture of the chicken in either dish. The service was great and I really like watching the food being prepared. I will order from here again, probably a beef dish."

City Light Restaurant,Buffets,"460 Topsail Rd St John's, NL A1E 2C2 Canada",NL,47.532948,-52.752171,3,"Food was hit or miss. Some items like the noodles weren't great and the baked potato was not good either. Other things like the wings, rice, broccoli and general tso chicken was pretty good. Nothing extraordinary. Ice cream was good, central dairies stuff.

Staff was tentative but it was completely dead so that was kind of expected.

Now the price, pretty ridiculous if you ask me. $30 per person is a bit out there for what it is but I guess that's what covid done to this place.

If you want to try it, go for it. I was stoned so I was loving it. Some of the food was not up to par but what do you expect, this place is dead."

The highlights for me were the wonton soup and hot and sour soup, allowing me to have ""hot and sour wonton soup "". So good. The second bonus was the delicious pork dumplings, with small bowls nearby so you can bring some of the sauce (goya-ish) back to your table for dipping. Other unique fare included sticky buns, dim sum and white rice. The chicken and broccoli was a nice variation. Recommended."

First time going to buffett since the pandemic 😫
I use to love their food...but after last week...I won't be going back.
And it has doubled in price...but the quality of the food has gone down drastically.
The Chinese food was like it was all cooked in the same sauce...and the Canadian food was too hard and dry to eat🤮"
City Light Restaurant,Buffets,"460 Topsail Rd St John's, NL A1E 2C2 Canada",NL,47.532948,-52.752171,1,"Food was pretty good, but $30/person is insane. They have a sign on each table warning that any scraps you leave on your plate will be weighed and you will be charged $9.99 per pound for any food you can't eat.  Not a pleasant dining experience."
Kellys Pub,Pubs,"25 George Street St John's, NL A1C 1B8 Canada",NL,47.5609969,-52.7111774,1,"We used to eat at this restaurant all the time and get excellent service. Since Covid the service kept going downhill every time we placed an order. Today we placed an order, and when we showed up, my husband was given one order instead of two. The staff argued with him and myself, saying that we only placed one order and their staff was right not me. I asked him what would I gain by showing up to pick up two orders when there was only one ready? We ordered there that much they would have known our orders previously and known that we have never placed one order. We always place the exact same order all the time.. so instead of saying that the person on the phone was mistaken, they just argued with me and said no, it was me that was wrong. Then she wondered why I wouldn’t take that food that was ready and wait for more to be made so I could have one order of food half cold. I asked to have two orders made, and they refused. Needless to say, it will be my last order placed ever there. The staff is rude, not friendly at all. Even the food itself has gone downhill since Covid started. There was absolutely no one in the store, picking up an order or eating in at this time, so I think this should tell them to treat people better. It’s not worth my time ordering from a place that calls me a liar about my own order. I think I remember what I ordered."

The deep fried BBQ pork bun had a lot of flavour but I thought it would be bigger.

The sweet & sour pork was spot on but it was strange that it tomatoes instead of red pepper in it. But it was still tasty overall.

The egg roll was flavoursome. I liked it.

The crispy wonton was wonton sheets deep fried. It wasn't deep fried wonton balls with shrimp & pork in it. But it was still good with the sauce.

The coconut pudding was a coconut filling in batter, deep fried and dusted with icing sugar. It was sweet to end the meal.

The restaurant had a great atmosphere and the service was good too. I would come back here and try other dishes on the menu."

I was surprised that there weren't any specials, especially on a Monday. Most restaurants have daily specials. We both ordered the chicken club and shared a small garlic fingers. Both were very good.

We ordered for pick up a 90 dollar order and honestly I have never felt so ripped off!! 2 thumbs down. Took a hour to bring out to us. Not a soul in the park lot. The dinner for 4 was honestly enough fir 1. Very poor quality. We definitely will not be back! I thought as a business owner myself. How can you feel good about sending this out to a family. Brutal!  Save your money.
Kenmount Restaurant,Chinese,"75 Kenmount Road St. John's, NL A1B 3P8 Canada",NL,47.5576444,-52.7559426,5,"I love the old layout and the building has a cool design.
I dont know why people are complaining so much. Why would you go to a restaurant just for the wallpaper?
You should go there for the food.

I had the Yang Chow Fried Rice and I enjoyed it.
Its just too bad im broke because theres so many other dishes there that sound yummy and I dont have the money to afford to go there often but the food is well worth the price.

We dont see a lot of fancy old school Chinese restaurants like this anymore.
I think its cool.

If its not busy there like how it used to be then thats because there's a Buffet across the street. DUHHH!
So its not because the restaurant is bad , its a very good restaurant but people who are cheapskates rather pay $20 at a buffet to eat cheap quality buffet food with very little taste in the meats that isnt always fresh instead of spending a little extra money to go to a traditional Chinese diner and order freshly yummy well cooked served Chinese dishes made with better quality."

My favourite place for takeout in St. John's, by far."

The beef mafe is world class, nothing like it in St John's. The marinated chicken in their dishes is crazy. They serve fresh Baobab Juice and I'm telling you, for a hangover, nothing beats it. It's a miracle cure. They also have the best price in town for Jarritos soda. The owner is very excited to explain any questions you have about his products. They've got a huge selection of spices, skin and haircare, cold drinks, and grocery items on top of their amazing food. I bought a pack of orange blossom soap and now I smell like a king.

Also, the food they serve is halal. When you go, you have to try the hot pepper sauce that the owner prepares himself. It's almost like a salsa and you will be addicted right away!!"

I would have liked a bit more beef in the portion but it was still very good! I also got the pineapple-ginger juice which was amazing! It had a strong ginger flavour which I loved. I had the bissap as well which was phenomenal!

We dined in the restaurant which has several cozy tables indoors as well as outdoor seating. We had the burrito and ""chicken"" tacos both made vegan. They are not kidding about the spice on the habanero sauce, but that is to be expected and it was great. The burrito was delicious and filling. We often struggle to find vegan options when we travel but this place was great. We were stuffed so we didn't have dessert but they had several vegan and gluten free sweets on offer as well."

Salt meat was like brine,  turnip was strong and sinewy.  Gravy was like water,  I have been sick all night due to the level of salt in the beef.   Worst ever!

Big R,American (Traditional),"201 Blackmarsh Rd. St John's, NL A1E Canada",NL,47.5460717,-52.7384772,1,Been there for pickup. Asked the lady infront how much time will it take and she said Mayb it’s 10 min or 20 min. Then I was asking a guy and she interrupted us by saying she already talked to me. After I said this is rude she start passing racist comments. I really prefer not to go here if you are not Canadian. Facing this kind of behavior first time in Canada. *racist*
Big R,American (Traditional),"201 Blackmarsh Rd. St John's, NL A1E Canada",NL,47.5460717,-52.7384772,1,Terrible place if you knew what happens in that kitchen you'd never eat there again. Worked as delivery driver at blackmarsh rd location for 4 years. I have seen first hand the nepotism and lack of respect they have for their workers. After I had been there for 3 years the other driver quit so the owner hired his friend to do deliveries. Well suddenly I started getting scheduled for less days and rescheduled from the busy days like friday and saturday. The owner was pushing me out to favor his friend even though I had been there for years at this point. When good friday came around the best day for the year to be doing deliveries for the big r I wasn't even scheduled despite being the driver that was there the longest. So in summation terrible food terrible owner St.john's would be better off without the big r

Good price, 6.50 for ""one slice"" which is actually 2. Very filling, served warm, good variety of toppings, definitely a step up from any Fast Food pizza you can get in st John's.

Other menu items: was surprised to find out that their fries are actually amazing, did not expect that from a pizza place. Putine is also good. Overall, you can expect everything on their menu to be served warm and in large portions.

Overall experience: As someone who goes there a lot I have never had a bad experience with customer service, food is served quickly and the people working there are pretty chill.
Only Con is that the store is not very big so there is not always places to sit, that's really only a problem in winter though since it is right next to Bannerman Park."

Subway,Sandwiches,"18 Commonwealth Avenue Mount Pearl, NL A1N 1W5 Canada",NL,47.5198302,-52.8082298,1,"I ordered a sub with double cheddar online, so 8 pieces of cheese.. I think.. Either way, there wasn’t any cheese on my sub at all.  I was already home it was late by the time I noticed, so I wrote the manager.
The manager offered me extra cheese for free the next time I buy a sub, after sending him proof of course..
So the math is: they rip you off for 8 pieces of cheese and correct that by giving you 4 pieces of cheese if you buy another sub.
There are subway stores in either direction, I won’t be returning to this one."

Drinks:
Ordered the Black Walnut Old Fashioned. I always gravitate towards old fashioned whenever I see it. Not the absolutely best but it does the job.

Food:
We started with the duck liver pate. We just simply love pate. Richmond Station provided a new experience for us. We haven’t had it with strawberry jam(?) but it went well over the brioche toast. We ordered the Stn Burger and this weekly special item that has bacon wrapped rabbit. We asked for plain but to keep the rest on the side. Hard to review this as my girlfriend prefers plain burgers. She did enjoy it though. Dessert was interesting. I recommend the rhubarb sundae. The earl grey whip cream was simply amazing. It had this rhubarb syrup and sorbet and stacked with these waffle crunch. What the heck is a waffle crunch anyway? Oh well, let’s not think too much and just enjoy good food.

Definitely can recommend this place. The pricing isn’t on the cheap side BUT gratuities are not expected. They’re able to pay their employees well, foster a good environment for everyone, and more. I like this so 5/5."

The duck liver pate 🦆 is mind blowing - the combination with dried strawberry and strawberry sauce is something you must try! The brioche, that accompany the  pate, Is delicious itself 😋 the menu changes every 3-4 weeks, so, don't hurry up with the burger - it's been in the menu for 10 years and will not disappear 😉"

The station burger was a great choice as well as the chickpea panisse! what was most refreshing was at the end they didn’t expect a tip because it was included in the bill! I really appreciated this!

The food itself was just average compared to our palette. Underwhelming flavors on most of the course. The empanada on the first amuse was dry. The watercress soup was a mid level dish with 2 out our 4 diners still containing shrimp shells. Definitely not what we expected from a Top Chef winner, but it could have been an off night for the team."

Service was great!"

You can clearly tell that the brisket and ribs were boiled, not smoked. The ribs are tough and don’t fall off the bone. The pulled pork burger consists of an extremely dry and tasteless patty and about a teaspoon of pulled pork which was barely pulled. The chicken is raw and also tasteless. It’s great to come here after having a bad day and being cheered up by the amazing waitresses as long as you don’t eat anything."

Their lunch special is good value for money. We sat down for a quick lunch on a weekend. The space is clean and well kept.

We started with the Takoyaki, which was mostly batter and one small piece of octopus in each ball. I wouldn’t order these again.

Their lunch specials range from $16-20 and come with a main, rice, miso soup and side dishes. We chose the steak lunch, which was a nice variety of flavours. The steak could have been better as it was a bit chewy but for the price, not a bad deal. If we visit again, I’d like to try one of the cuts from their regular menu.

The slight disappointment here was the service. The host and server were pleasant but the service was quite slow and no one checked on us. I had to get up once to go ask for chopsticks and again to ask for the bill.

Overall, it’s fairly good value if you’re hungry!"

This was a filling meal, but didn’t leave me feeling stuffed or uncomfortable, which is exactly what I wanted. The Sapporo went surprisingly well with the dish. The online ordering was easy to use, but the servers were still attentive and helpful. It was busy on a weekend night, so i recommend making a reservation."
Holy Cow Japanese Steakhouse,Steakhouses,"254 Queen Street  W Toronto, ON M5V 1Z8 Canada",ON,43.650053,-79.3914456,5,"Excellent steak. I had the wagyu beef. Sure it is the American version, but it was still great, cooked just right, and very reasonably priced (82 CAD for 10oz). The sides were very good too. Highly recommended."
Holy Cow Japanese Steakhouse,Steakhouses,"254 Queen Street  W Toronto, ON M5V 1Z8 Canada",ON,43.650053,-79.3914456,5,"First + foremost service was excellent! The food was delicious, hot and fresh. The sizzling plates are a perfect touch to the experience. Casual vibe, good music and overall very welcoming.

If you’re downtown looking for a casual spot for a great steak dinner — do your taste buds a favour and stop in."
Holy Cow Japanese Steakhouse,Steakhouses,"254 Queen Street  W Toronto, ON M5V 1Z8 Canada",ON,43.650053,-79.3914456,3,"With the atmosphere like any good established steakhouse... Expectations were reasonably high although the results seemed to be pretty average and rather disappointing across the table.

The Wagyu Don I had asked for was good without being great with the cook being just about there and a dish that could've always done with a little more meat. Sadly across the table, the Sirloin was tough and barely rare and needed 2 hotplates to get it to a consistent rare to consume comfortably.

Supposing this is a one-off, I would be willing to give them another try down the line with the recommendation to introduce thicker hot plates that would allow the dish to remain warm for longer and even cover for any cooking inconsistencies."
Rasa,Canadian (New),"196 Robert Street Toronto, ON M5S 2K8 Canada",ON,43.6628642,-79.4041013,5,"We keep coming back to this place. The food is always consistently incredible with excellent flavours. Portion sizes are decent. The menu is shareable and is split into vegetables, sea and land so there are options for everyone. Menu favourites are the chopped salad, ceviche and sticky bun for dessert (you can get the bacon on the side). The new addition of chickpea fritters to the menu was a great choice too (hopefully it stays!). Honourable mention to the burger (not pictured), though it used to come with fries and now it doesn’t."
Rasa,Canadian (New),"196 Robert Street Toronto, ON M5S 2K8 Canada",ON,43.6628642,-79.4041013,5,"An amazingly creative, playful and delicious restaurant in the heart of the Annex. The classic tasting menu offered a diverse selection of their menu items and we were allowed to swap out the burger for tacos. The tasting menu was also a bargain at just 60 a person and server Alex was very knowledgeable and provided excellent service as well. Just be warned that the food is a bit on the heavy side so do come extra hungry. We will definitely be returning to try all the other items on the menu."
Rasa,Canadian (New),"196 Robert Street Toronto, ON M5S 2K8 Canada",ON,43.6628642,-79.4041013,5,"I loved every bite and every sip! We had the chickpea fritters, chopped salad, beef short ribs, and lemon cake for dessert. My husband’s favorites were the chopped salad and the fritters and he really enjoyed the negroni as well as the “where there’s smoke…” that he was recommended to try. It’s hard to do the dishes justice without trying them for yourself but I highly recommend this place for friendly, attentive and fast service as well as a delicious night out. The food is sharing plates and we ordered three which was almost too much for just the two of us. Dessert wasn’t necessary but then… it always is.
Also, we got lost trying to find the restaurant! Not sure if this was because our Uber dropped us off down the street but the address didn’t seem to match the physical location. In case this happens to anyone else, it IS there on the main road, just keep looking.  It’s worth looking for"
Rasa,Canadian (New),"196 Robert Street Toronto, ON M5S 2K8 Canada",ON,43.6628642,-79.4041013,4,"We were 2 couples and we started off with their Refreshing Peach drink, and a Spicy concoction. They were both amazing and went with every dish.

For Vegetarian options, we had the Chickpea Fritters, Salad, and Squash Ravioli. Non-Veg dishes our friends had were the Octopus and Crab dishes. Service was amazing and the food was really tasty.

The only issue was the portion size. They say it is Tapas style, but for $25 of Squash Ravioli, there could definitely be more on the plate, or like have more than 1 tentacle for $42 of Octopus.

We finished our meal with their Sweet Dish. It was really tasty but quite heavy on the sugar."
Rasa,Canadian (New),"196 Robert Street Toronto, ON M5S 2K8 Canada",ON,43.6628642,-79.4041013,5,"We really loved the family style dining and had 4 dishes between 2 people. The service was really friendly. The server recommended the chop salad, burger, and tuna tartare which were all great. We also really loved the pea pappardelle which was super lemony and light. The cocktails were really yummy as well, the mango-rita was our favourite. patio was very cute."
Megumi Mazesoba,Japanese,"46 Saint Clair Avenue E Toronto, ON M4T 1M9 Canada",ON,43.6887264,-79.3919129,5,"Addicted to Mazesoba but they’re hard to find outside of Japan. In Vancouver there’s one and even in big megapolitan like LA there’s only one, NYC only one … you get the picture. Toronto, dubbed as the most diverse city in the world, didn’t have one … until Megumi.

Food was tasty and delicious. Service was great. Make it a point to be a regular here and tell all your friends of this amazing food."
Megumi Mazesoba,Japanese,"46 Saint Clair Avenue E Toronto, ON M4T 1M9 Canada",ON,43.6887264,-79.3919129,5,Great food with a relaxed atmosphere and great service. The noodles are very tasty and they do not cheap out on the toppings on each dish. The chili oil and kombu vinegar pack a lot of flavors that add to the dishes.
Megumi Mazesoba,Japanese,"46 Saint Clair Avenue E Toronto, ON M4T 1M9 Canada",ON,43.6887264,-79.3919129,5,"I have lots of experience eating Japanese cuisine, especially ramen. Though this isn't technically ramen, the style is similar in the sense that it is a bowl of noodles with various sauces and toppings. The flavours of the dishes are very balanced, one spice does not overpower the other. They allow the dish to speak for itself. Appearance wise, it's very neat, not too complex, but not too simple. It's indicative of a chef that is confident in their food, and it really shows when you eat it. Atmosphere wise, it is very relaxing. You do not feel too rushed to finish your meal, and the layout of the building coupled with the relaxing music really compliments the taste of the food quite well. The owner is also quite friendly and is happy to help anyone who may be confused in regards to how to eat Mazesoba, being how it is such a new dish for most in Canada. Overall, great experience, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to try something new or step outside their comfort zone."
Megumi Mazesoba,Japanese,"46 Saint Clair Avenue E Toronto, ON M4T 1M9 Canada",ON,43.6887264,-79.3919129,5,"Megumi Mazesoba opened up in my neighbourhood two months ago, and I had been meaning to check it out sooner…boy, I wish I did!

I went with a friend of mine who had been raving about it, and the owner Paula - and the moment we walked in, I could understand why. The warmth and familiarity with which we were greeted INSTANTLY made us feel at home!

It was lunchtime on a Friday and I would say it was more than 50% occupied. We picked a table perpendicular from the long row of tables along the far wall. I would say that while we were there, it only got busier - both with dine-in patrons and people coming in to pick their takeaway orders up! All the more impressive that there were only TWO visible employees working - Paula (who worked the floor with her hospitality and also somehow managed to assist with the dish preparations) and another gentleman.

My friend and I both ordered the Megumi Mazesoba - hers with no spice, while I got the “Signature Spicy” which is a mid-tier spice level. Man - I can handle my spices and this was definitely a fragrant, pungent, sharp and delicious spiciness! They don’t mess around.

We both got our bowls with Udon noodles. They were PERFECTLY cooked - warm, supple, bouncy, and mixed together with the pork lard, ajitama egg, and all the other ingredients, it was a FLAVOUR BOMB in my mouth! Soooooo good.

DO NOT finish all the sauce at the bottom of the bowl - I made this mistake because it was just too yummy to resist, but you are supposed to save a bit of it to eat with rice at the end. Thankfully, my friend hadn’t hoovered her food down like I did so she spared some of her sauce for me and I got to enjoy those last few bites that are meant to be mixed with the rice.

I am still dreaming about this mazesoba…🤤🤤🤤

For dessert, Paula brought out little sample portions of the banana cigar dish, served with ice cream. It is like a banana spring roll. Very simple and delightful, and a nice, sweet finish to a meal filled with so much savouriness.

It is so great to finally have a GOOD Asian noodle restaurant option in this neighbourhood.

👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼"
Megumi Mazesoba,Japanese,"46 Saint Clair Avenue E Toronto, ON M4T 1M9 Canada",ON,43.6887264,-79.3919129,5,"Today was my first time coming to Megumi Mazesoba, and make no mistake, it won’t be my last! From the moment I walked in, I was amazed by the ambiance of the establishment and how it was designed, then I was greeted humbly by Paula as I entered, and Steven from the kitchen then after. I ordered the house special and between the thin noodles with meat and egg and other ingredients, along with the white rice that came with it after to scoop up the rest of the sauce, I have to say that I was incredibly satisfied with my meal. Broth-less Ramen in my modest opinion is really underrated, and this Ramen Establishment along St. Clair East is one I would recommend hold heartedly. Thank you for the wonderful experience, it was worth every dollar.
UPDATE:
Megumi Mazesoba was so good the last time I was there [the day before] that I had to come back again to order the same signature dish, (only this time with udon noodles). This style of noodle reminds me of the homemade style of pasta, my paternal grandmother used to make, which made the experience all the more worthwhile! Thanks again Paula and Audrey (from the kitchen) for great food, great service, and for once again, welcoming me back into the humbling and modest ambiance of your establishment!!!"

You place your order at the counter, take an order number and they bring you what they prepare. They have a variety of healthy types of food, smoothies and cookies. Me and my friend had smoothies that we enjoyed a lot as well as a chocolate sesame cookie which was delicious. Will definitely come back."

Mary Be Kitchen,Canadian (New),"21B St. Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M4V 1K6 Canada",ON,43.6876231,-79.3949696,5,This was my first time getting food here as I usually only stop in for a drink. I loved the variety they had. My friend got 1 protein + 2 sides and I just got 2 sides. We both got the Mac and cheese which was so delicious. My friend got their mocha smoothie which I’ll definitely be getting next time as it was so tasty. I got the ginger maple lemonade which was very refreshing too. I’ll definitely will be coming back here

Mary Be Kitchen,Canadian (New),"21B St. Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M4V 1K6 Canada",ON,43.6876231,-79.3949696,5,"5. Had a wonderful first experience at Mary Be Kitchen. Went with a group for lunch so had the opportunity to try many things. The sides are flavorful and delicious- very much enjoyed the brussel sprouts and found all the sides quite flavorful. The smoothies are a great consistency and the desserts (sweet potato brownie and vegan cookie) were both so good!!!!!! Need to return to try the lentil dal and the curry!

Returned for the lentil Dahl- and it’s amazing- comes on long grain rice with currents.

The regular salted chocolate chip cookie is really amazing too."
Positano Restaurant,Pizza,"633 Mount Pleasant Road Toronto, ON M4S 2M9 Canada",ON,43.7047104,-79.3885304,5,"The menu offered a wide variety of authentic Italian dishes, each one made with the freshest ingredients and expertly prepared.  We started off with mussels and clams in a white wine sauce and grilled calamari. Both cooked perfectly and bursting with flavor.
Main courses included Pizza, Pasta alla Gricia, Lemon Bisque Shrimp spaghetti and Branzino. I’d love to say something negative here, but it’s impossible. These dishes were just outstanding. The branzino on another level of freshness and perfect preparation.
To finish off the meal, we had the tiramisu. It was light and fluffy, with just the right amount of sweetness and a hint of coffee.
I would highly recommend Positano Restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and authentic Italian dining experience in Toronto. The food, atmosphere, and service were all exceptional and I can't wait to go back!"

The staff are great at recommending food items on the menu, the service is also great! There’s indoor and outdoor dining; all dishes were delicious! It’s recommended to try multiple dishes to get a full experience on the various items on the menu. I highly recommend the mushroom cheese and rice dish!"

The service is on point, the ambiance is great and they’re not going to disappoint. In terms of food you need to try their Salmon/Shrimp Ozusushi, the chicken karaage, and the rice bowls! Highly recommend trying a sake bomb if you’re with a group of people too! Overall this is great spot and I was really happy with my experience."
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,Japanese,"398 Church Street Toronto, ON M5B 2A2 Canada",ON,43.6605922,-79.3790304,5,"Great for light dinner...we could've easily eaten more if we were hungrier. But we were perfectly served.

Loved the imported sashimi and the lobster sashimi too. Chicken Namban hit the spot. Fun atmosphere with a young attentive staff. $3 Soju shots? There's a catch - gotta cheer with the staff and the rest of the crowd. But hey, why not...I won't forget eating there now!"
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,Japanese,"398 Church Street Toronto, ON M5B 2A2 Canada",ON,43.6605922,-79.3790304,3,"Came before the dinner rush - but service was a little slow to begin with. I ordered the grilled mackerel bento, the mackerel was good, however the fish cake tempura was not the 'crispy' tempura I was expecting, was kind of soggy and cold. Dining outside was a cool experience, but the food wasn't what I expected, and service overall could've been better."
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,Japanese,"398 Church Street Toronto, ON M5B 2A2 Canada",ON,43.6605922,-79.3790304,5,"Super fun high energy atmosphere! The heated patio is much quieter if you want a chiller vibe. Everything from our drinks (neko punch and the gin fizz) to our shared plates was amazing, and our server Nick was so friendly and attentive even though it was a busy night! The miso cod special was one of the best plates of fish I've ever had. The tapas are pretty small so you may also want to get a main if you're hungry, but everything is very reasonably priced for how beautiful and delicious it is! Oh, and the hojicha brulee was to die for."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,Thai,"18 Duncan Street Toronto, ON M5H 3G8 Canada",ON,43.6478695,-79.3886849,4,"Came back after a while and food was still very nice. We came as a group of 6 and all of the food we order were great. I love Tom Yum so much. Green curry and chef’s choice are the must-try dishes.
It was a little bit packed when we arrived, there were enough room for us to sit comfortable.
Drinks were not really nice."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,Thai,"18 Duncan Street Toronto, ON M5H 3G8 Canada",ON,43.6478695,-79.3886849,5,"One of the top spots in Toronto for Thai dishes. Very long lines even during weekdays.
The best dish was hands downt the pad Thai. It was everything I expected it to be. The green curry was not exceptional but everything we tried was delicious. Portion sizes are average and service was a little bit slow. Overall great with enjoyable food"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,Thai,"18 Duncan Street Toronto, ON M5H 3G8 Canada",ON,43.6478695,-79.3886849,5,"The food and service here were overall really great. They have an entire separate section for vegan and vegetarian, so it's definitely diet restriction friendly.

The Khao Soi curry noodles with the crunchy noodles and egg noodles had a nice texture contrast as well as strong curry flavor. Beef was a tad tough so I'd go with the chicken next time. As for appetizers, the Grabong (squash fritter) was amazing. The dip that comes with it was so flavorful and not too sweet while the fritter itself wasn't too oily.

I recommend either coming 10-15 mins early before opening to grab a table for 1st seating, or getting a reservation outright. The lines start to get long before it even opens even on weekdays."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,Thai,"18 Duncan Street Toronto, ON M5H 3G8 Canada",ON,43.6478695,-79.3886849,5,Amazing spot for authentic Thai food. The Tom Yum soup was spicy and tangy and packs a punch.

Definitely recommend coming here."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,Thai,"2335 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4P 2E6 Canada",ON,43.708653,-79.3982462,5,Been to their downtown location before but love love love the vibe of this location! A little hard to spot from the street but the interior is beautiful. The food came fairly quickly and definitely reminded me of Thailand. Fair portions and lots of options on the menu. It's a little pricey but understandable with how popular this place is. The dishes were well executed and had a lot of flavour. Would definitely return again!
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,Thai,"2335 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4P 2E6 Canada",ON,43.708653,-79.3982462,4,"Loved this northern Thai restaurant. Foods are very authentic and tasty, service is good and fast. I liked this location because it is less busy than the downtown location.

Service was great and attentive, food was amazing, and overall a great experience. My only complaint is that it took a while for our server to take our order however food came out quick and hot. I liked how they served our meals at the same time. You have to try the coconut sorbet served in a coconut shell-  best sorbet I’ve ever had. The restaurant closed at 10pm but they let us finished our meal, left around 10:30pm. Would def recommend!"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,Thai,"2335 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4P 2E6 Canada",ON,43.708653,-79.3982462,5,"First time at PAI uptown and it won’t be my last. From the moment I got there, I loved the atmosphere. We had some time before our table so we enjoyed some cocktails at the bar. The bartenders were so helpful and friendly from helping us decide what drinks we might like to try to what dishes off main courses might be a good choice. We all loved our meals and drinks and to finish on a high note..do get the coconut sorbet! Best shared though as it’s a big portion - but just scrumptious (although I wish there was more mango) ! Thumbs up for great friendly staff all around, great music too. Might be a little loud for intimate conversations but we managed. A must try if you haven’t been here yet. Vegan options bonus. Busy area so plan ahead for parking on the street or find a green P.  Subway right near by too."

The service was really good and super attentive. We got their dips, tabule, manti dumplings, akawi cheese, batata harra, adana kabab and lamb chops. And kunafa for dessert. The manti dumplings, and akawi were a stand out. The only thing we didn’t enjoy is the kunafa only because we make the best at home. Their patio and vibe is really nice and we’d def come again."
Mayrik,Mediterranean,"1580 Bayview Avenue Toronto, ON M4G 3B7 Canada",ON,43.7056941,-79.3754415,5,"This restaurant is amazing. Had a late lunch there. We first called in @Mirage Restaurant on the same street and were treated rather strangely. The food at the Mayrik is top shelf, the service out of 10 is at 11.

Mayrik,Mediterranean,"1580 Bayview Avenue Toronto, ON M4G 3B7 Canada",ON,43.7056941,-79.3754415,5,"The fatoush and the falafel were very flavourful, very satisfying. Just on the brink of too much seasoning which is really unnecessary. Also, I was really looking to get radish and pomegranate seeds, as became customary in fatoush at other restaurants - or else the dish feels simplistic and overpriced. The Armenian beer is very good, malty - would drink another if not costing $10."
Mayrik,Mediterranean,"1580 Bayview Avenue Toronto, ON M4G 3B7 Canada",ON,43.7056941,-79.3754415,4,"Definitely a must try spot in Toronto. The service was great, the concept of being an Armenian fusion was on point. While the food did not blow my mind away, the experience and taste was for sure above par. You won’t regret trying this place out - ambience, service, food, everything is of high quality."

Though the waiter forgot to give us olive oil for the bread at first, he later prepared and introduced us the hidden special spicy oil for it, which we loved it!
Ordered the most popular pasta and the pizza Giovanni. Food is awesome. Service is excellent as he knew we are sharing our food, pasta came in two separate plates, one for each of us.
The recommended creme brule cheesecake is very good and so natural that the combination seems meant to be together.
I will definitely go again and again!"

Easy street side parking just in front of the restaurant.

Upon arrival, we find the restaurant quite spacious and the staff was friendly.

They seem to be quite kid-friendly as well
- there are high chairs
- paper and crayons for coloring
- Unicorn chopsticks that our girl love
- Kid friendly utensils as well

We ordered a bowl of udon, the spicy trio sushi and an appetizer.

Prior to the food we ordered, we gave us the appetizer (small portion of delicious noodles in broth with some crunchy tempura bits). Our sushi combo also came with salads.

Overall it was a nice experience."

The waitress is very kind and attentive. The food is delicious! I've had numerous types of sushi and maki from here and it's always fresh. The bulgogi was very tasty too. Got a pineapple vodka drink to top it off. Extremely satisfying meal, I will be back 😌"
Kintako Japanese Restaurant,Japanese,"214 Laird Drive Suite 101 Toronto, ON M4G 3W4 Canada",ON,43.711497,-79.3640847,5,"Pretty good quality fish here, especially considering the price. Definitely a step up from a lot of other sushi places in the neighbourhood. The service is great too."
Kintako Japanese Restaurant,Japanese,"214 Laird Drive Suite 101 Toronto, ON M4G 3W4 Canada",ON,43.711497,-79.3640847,5,"Wish I had found this place sooner. Quality is on the higher end of non-izakaya places. And the value for the lunch combo is unbeatable. Not to mention the presentation too! Did not expect the lunch combo to be served on a wooden platter

Their menu has a variety of appetizers and sushi, including dishes that not many places know about, as well as some of their unique traditional rolls.
Will come back for more"

Then we each ordered dragon rolls.. So delicious… and we are sushi snobs! We have tested sushi from Toronto to Thunder Bay.., This was the best in Toronto, and on par with the Thunder Bay we had .. We would definitely make the 2 hour drive into Toronto again just to have sushi here.
Highly recommend it!"
Mira,Peruvian,"420A Wellington Street W Toronto, ON M5V 1E3 Canada",ON,43.6440688,-79.3963113,4,"They had a total change!

I came here when they first opened and a couple times after that. It’s been a few years since I visited last time but wow they changed their entire menu.

Honestly I think the previous chef was better. Trio ceviche was disappointing, not sure why they had to add a vegetarian version.

Happy hour was cute but the quality of food wasn’t there. Maybe because it’s happy hour food?

The beef tongue and short ribs were nice. Beef tongue was the best dish. Their fried rice was also interesting but great. I’d recommend the beef tongue, short rib and the rice. The rest were mediocre."
Mira,Peruvian,"420A Wellington Street W Toronto, ON M5V 1E3 Canada",ON,43.6440688,-79.3963113,5,"Perfecto!!! Food, service, and atmospheres are perfect. There's nothing to complain about!

I was always in the pain when the restaurant asked a bunch of tips and actually did nothing.

BUT! waitresses here, is next level.

They catch your needs right away!!!!!! Especially the waitress who served us today (braided hair) has a beautiful attitude. (The owner of the restaurant,  please compensate her.) I was extremely surprised that I didn't have to call them for help.

Amigos, please go to this place and enjoy your dinner!!!!!"
Mira,Peruvian,"420A Wellington Street W Toronto, ON M5V 1E3 Canada",ON,43.6440688,-79.3963113,5,"Mira was a surprising discovery! We were craving some Peruvian food and Google suggested Mira! Tucked away in a quaint little street on Wellington Street, Mira has a beautiful ambience and really good food! The waiter was super nice and courteous as well. The portions look small, but trust me, they're super filling. The chicken empanadas stole the show totally! So flavourful and filling. Definitely going back!"
Mira,Peruvian,"420A Wellington Street W Toronto, ON M5V 1E3 Canada",ON,43.6440688,-79.3963113,4,"Really cute place. Service and food was a little slow but the food was really good.  We ordered the ceviche trio and it all tasted different, in a good way.  Not the typical lemony ceviche that you get.  The wagyu carpaccio was ok, the beef was cut too thin so didn't capture a lot of flavors. The short rib was pretty tasty.  The meat was tender and sauce was good.  I'd go back to try the other dishes.  Oh if you like your cocktails stiff, this is the place.  Dang was hard to down it but 1 drink got us buzz. 😜"
Mira,Peruvian,"420A Wellington Street W Toronto, ON M5V 1E3 Canada",ON,43.6440688,-79.3963113,5,We went there for my birthday and I really enjoyed it. The only thing is that service is really slow. The Ribeye is a must. A bit pricey but worth it. The grilled chicken was also Amazing. The 3 leches was just superbe. Highly recommend.

I was having this weird obsession with hot dogs and I saw that Grandma love you made a variety of them. The Swedish dog was definitely my favourite. It was pretty cold that day and I remember just eating it in my truck and it was fabulous. The spicy ham is my favourite sandwich for sure, the chefs choice was also very good. I know my brother loves the German rye sandwiches, since he always asks me to pick him up one if I’m in the area. Really nice to see them expanding, I just hope the quality doesn’t get compromised due to that."
Grandma Loves You,Sandwiches,"1084 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4W 2L4 Canada",ON,43.6778353,-79.390252,5,"Was recommended the Spicy Ham and Cheese Sandwich and it was phenomenal! Sandwich was juicy and fresh, truly felt nutritious. Would say it would’ve gone perfectly with chips and a drink, which they have. Ate half of the 12” and feel full but not heavy, no bloating. Would recommend to try out!"
Grandma Loves You,Sandwiches,"1084 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4W 2L4 Canada",ON,43.6778353,-79.390252,5,"I love deli sandwiches, and someone told me that this place offers the best sandwiches in Toronto! A bold statement but I would rank it  near the top for sure! The amount of people coming in and out of this place tells you it's a sandwich place worth trying! Got the mixed cold cut and honestly was full after eating only 6 inches of my 12 inc sub sandwich! Good typical cold cut ingredients, i was able to add green pepper and olives! If i would go back i would probably ask for banana hot peppers! The grandma Sauce they use is good! If you're into deli sandwiches, you should definitely check this place out!"
Grandma Loves You,Sandwiches,"1084 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4W 2L4 Canada",ON,43.6778353,-79.390252,5,"Been wanting to try this place for a long time! Oh boy it didn't disappoint. Got 3 different 12 inch subs and each one was so good.  I can't wait to go back and try another set of 3.  The staff were super friendly and helped me choose as it was our first time. It's a small place but with a little corner window seat, prefect for a quick bite, with leftovers to spare... unless you are like me and devoured the entire thing. People who knew what they were ordering were in and out quickly. This place takes sandwiches to a whole other level! Def worth trying!"
Grandma Loves You,Sandwiches,"1084 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4W 2L4 Canada",ON,43.6778353,-79.390252,5,Very friendly adn quick service. Prices are on the higher end for a sandwich but still within reasonable range. Everything tasted fresh and quality. The spicy ham could have been a little more exciting but no complaints. I would try this place again when I'm in the area.
Aloette,French,"163 Spadina Avenue 1st Floor Toronto, ON M5V 2L6 Canada",ON,43.6485042,-79.3959494,5,"Attentive and easy to talk to staff. We’ve been here twice now and love it every time. It’s a must when we visit Toronto. Eve fry thing in the menu is great. We’ve tried new things every time but the wedge salad is to die for. It has such a refreshing touch!

Desert was great. The lemon pie was too tart for me so I prefer the strawberry parfait.

Overall- this place is great. Just make sure you set up a reso before coming!"
Aloette,French,"163 Spadina Avenue 1st Floor Toronto, ON M5V 2L6 Canada",ON,43.6485042,-79.3959494,5,"An amazing experience from beginning to end. I’ve never been to a restaurant with such diligent front of house. It’s like magic when you turn around and realize your glass has been refilled or that your napkin has been folded neatly for you. Given their reputation it’s still a surprise.

The food is also really good and a good balance of comfort and original. The pigeon was essentially Korean fried chicken and the lemon meringue pie is classic. Speaking of which the food here is a bit acidic, but I prefer that! The torched scallops were platted like ceviche and was a great start. The complimentary cheese bread with smoked butter and the wedge salad were highlights. The wild rice with the wedge salad made it the standout dish by far, followed closely by the ravioli. 4-6 dishes should do it for 2 people.

Excited to try the other menu items!"
Aloette,French,"163 Spadina Avenue 1st Floor Toronto, ON M5V 2L6 Canada",ON,43.6485042,-79.3959494,5,"This was a great experience overall. The food selection was great for a smaller menu.

Each dish we tried had levels of flavour, and most importantly you definitively taste all flavours out into the dish… nothing got lost,

The presentation of each dish was photo worthy as you can see the care of how each dish is created.

The service was prompt and gave great recommendations for our group.

No complaints here."
Aloette,French,"163 Spadina Avenue 1st Floor Toronto, ON M5V 2L6 Canada",ON,43.6485042,-79.3959494,5,"Great service and experience, if you are going during peak lunch hours, it is better to reserve ahead of time via phone.

Great lunch menu, prices were a bit expensive relative to the portion size, but the flavours were great. Oysters seemed a bit small but were still flavourful. The prawn ceviche and the Aloette burger are definitely a must have when visiting.

The crispy squash was surprisingly sweet and served as a great end part to the meal even though it was not dessert specific dish."
Aloette,French,"163 Spadina Avenue 1st Floor Toronto, ON M5V 2L6 Canada",ON,43.6485042,-79.3959494,5,"One of the best spots I have tried in Toronto. Their burger was super flavorful. The complimentary toast was delicious. The stuff wings were very delicious but I wish it was a little more crispy. Their fries were also amazing. But the chocolate tart was the winner tonight definitely one of the best desserts ever. Super decadent and melt in your mouth rich.
Service was great. Fastest water refill ever not once my glass went more than half empty. Definitely recommend this place very nice atmosphere and amazing creative dishes. It's a little on the pricey side but worth the quality and creativity in my opinion."
Mexico Lindo,Mexican,"1618 Bayview Ave Toronto, ON M4S 1T3 Canada",ON,43.7063759,-79.3756998,5,"Been coming here for a few years. Always start with their lime margarita. 10/10 for flavor and portion. Get the pitcher size! Trust me !!!   We also started with their nachos and later had the Chorinacho for dinner . Yes we love nachos LOL but they make their fresh nachos here and was super good!  Always a favorite place to

It is a family style Mexico restaurant with only three people operating.  The dishes are like family cooking.  Lime Margarita is a good choice pairing with nice and tasty Enchilada, Chimichanga, Quesadilla and Tacos.  The price is reasonable!  Next time we will try Burritos and Fajitas!  We also order dessert, Churros with peanut and caramel mixed paste."
Mexico Lindo,Mexican,"1618 Bayview Ave Toronto, ON M4S 1T3 Canada",ON,43.7063759,-79.3756998,5,"One of the best Mexican restaurants in town! From the beautifully decorated interior, to the cute patio right on Bayview there’s a lot to love about Mexico Lindo. I highly recommend the enchiladas!"

I ordered this time through Ubereat. Food was still hot and tasty as usual.

Steak and shrimp were perfect. Delicous flavours. Good quality

Tacos were filled with lots of toppings. Lots of meat. I wish they gave extra hot sauce next time. Forgot to ask for it.

Anyway 10/10 for UberEat food"

The Olde Yorke,Seafood,"96 Laird Drive East York, ON M4G 3V3 Canada",ON,43.7062556,-79.3621144,5,"We accidentally found The Olde Yorke Fish and Chips in an old neighborhood setting. The pub reminds me of the UK pubs. Very authentic. The place feels old-fashioned cozy setting, with an old fashioned bar in the centre. There is an open patio. The fish is thick. The batter is thin and crunchy. The chips are thick cut, just like in the UK. As we left, we saw a truck deliver fresh fish inside. Not frozen, very good.

Waitresses are very friendly and helpful to us in choosing the many types of fish on the menu."
The Olde Yorke,Seafood,"96 Laird Drive East York, ON M4G 3V3 Canada",ON,43.7062556,-79.3621144,5,"This is is the best fish and chips I’ve ever had in Toronto now I haven’t eaten at every place but this is definitely now my favourite. the chips were so crispy and fresh the fish was  nicely battered not overly done and it was incredibly tasty. I had the cod with fries and coleslaw and everything was really well done, I end up spending $26 for my meal plus tea tip included and I think for what I ate and how good it was. It was a pretty good deal. The staff was nice and my waiter was so beautiful and friendly I will be coming back here. It’s a small place and gets very busy so perhaps book ahead of you have a larger group"
The Olde Yorke,Seafood,"96 Laird Drive East York, ON M4G 3V3 Canada",ON,43.7062556,-79.3621144,5,I got the Haddock and Chips. The piece of fish is quite large. Everything tastes great and it wasn't greasy. They don't include tarter sauce in the package so when they ask you if you want any condiments please ensure you ask for it. Oh their gravy is also really good. I will definitely go back. They have a nice space to eat outdoors too.
The Olde Yorke,Seafood,"96 Laird Drive East York, ON M4G 3V3 Canada",ON,43.7062556,-79.3621144,3,"Upon walking in, you have to bypass a huge curtain i guess to keep the cold out. This place also has a distinctly strong malt vinegar smell. The food was pretty good with their crispy fish and good fries. Their cod is delicious. Portions were not overtly large. My husband and I dined there. Server did not make eye contact with me once 🤷🏻‍♀️ and yes they were busy but did not ask if we wanted another drink and their glasses are smaller than average. I was thirsty. The two things annoyed me. Friendliest person in the joint was the friendly guy who greeted us and showed us to our table."
The Olde Yorke,Seafood,"96 Laird Drive East York, ON M4G 3V3 Canada",ON,43.7062556,-79.3621144,4,"The fish and chips were good. The mushy peas were watery and had a slight flavor - 🙁The vinegar was weak. The service was good.

Avoid the solarium- it has an external door which was opened multiple times on a very cold day without any extra door. Did not mind the cold but it did make my food colder faster"
TORA,Japanese,"612B-3401 Dufferin Street Upper Level Toronto, ON M6A 2T9 Canada",ON,43.7251083,-79.4528087,5,"Truly enjoyed this restaurant. They offer a variety of Japanese inspired dishes. The ingredients used are fresh and the menu is well thought of.

The overall ambience is pretty, and the conveyor belt system surely entertains our little ones. It’s family friendly and very clean. We came in on a weekday, as soon as they opened so we had the place to ourselves, a few minutes later we noticed that the place is full. So be sure to plan ahead, especially on peak hours.

Their aburi sushi selections are the best. Their red tuna just melts in your mouth! They have a few food options for non sushi lovers that are quite sumptuous.

Will definitely go back and will definitely recommend."

Note they don’t take reservations so groups of 4+ may have to wait. The menu was vast and we got to try a variety of different types. The service was speedy and the staff were friendly. The conveyer belt was a nice touch that brought your food out very quickly. Although pricier, everything was of a high quality and standard. Some dishes I have never seen but would love to try. I can’t wait to go back and try their dinner menu. Overall it was a very unique sushi experience that everyone should try."

TORA,Japanese,"612B-3401 Dufferin Street Upper Level Toronto, ON M6A 2T9 Canada",ON,43.7251083,-79.4528087,5,"Tora. For all the sushi aficionados, lovers of great quality fish and delightful artistry. Look no further. Tora has done a great job with their aburi(torched) and I do especially enjoy the sauce for their shrimp.

The tuna was fatty and buttery with every bite.

Only negative, the karaage was minuscule. The small tiny quantity was disappointing especially paying premium prices.

Otherwise always a great dine 😀"
The Oxley,Pubs,"121 Yorkville Avenue Toronto, ON M5R 1C4 Canada",ON,43.6705763,-79.393082,5,"We found this place while wandering around the streets of Yorkville.
Next time we will be looking for it!
We both had the Winterlicious menu offerings. Everything was delicious. The food was perfectly seasoned.
They had a wonderful Scotch whisky selection, worth going just for that.
This place brought us right back to our vacation in Scotland and Ireland
Our server was wonderful, but clearly the team there works together very well. We felt well looked after.
This was an amazing place and we will be back!"
The Oxley,Pubs,"121 Yorkville Avenue Toronto, ON M5R 1C4 Canada",ON,43.6705763,-79.393082,4,"We stopped in for a drink while walking around Yorkville enjoying a winter’s evening. A warm and inviting space that just looked like the perfect choice when walking by, and we weren’t disappointed. We chose the upstairs bar and dining room, and got great seats. The bar tender was extremely friendly, and discussed our drink preferences as he educated us on spirits we had not tried yet. After a lengthy discussion about gin, he pointed out the two he felt I would enjoy the most, and I ended really enjoying his first pick. My spouse enjoyed a hard cider. We weren’t hungry enough to eat, but all of the food coming out for the tables looked very appetizing, we will make sure to save room for our next visit and stop back."
The Oxley,Pubs,"121 Yorkville Avenue Toronto, ON M5R 1C4 Canada",ON,43.6705763,-79.393082,5,Great cocktail!!! It's like Provence summer in a glass! Thanks to the suggestion from our wonderful waitress!!
The Oxley,Pubs,"121 Yorkville Avenue Toronto, ON M5R 1C4 Canada",ON,43.6705763,-79.393082,1,"Food and ambience was great. Love the old London pub look, really brings the UK vibe.

Food for the most part was delicious, lots of traditional English dishes. The oxtail was perfectly cooked and the pudding soft and flavourful. My partner ordered the tenderloin medium rare and it came out raw. We sent it back to the kitchen and it returned a minute later looking exactly the same (see pic below). We sent it back again with the manager this time to have it cooked properly.

The main reason this restaurant receives a 1/5 is because of poor customer service. Our server was quite rude to our party of 8. When we asked about specials he curtly replied that he would prefer to wait to go over specials until the remaining two people show up so he doesn’t have to repeat the specials twice. Sure, makes sense but also is it that difficult to present the specials twice? One person in our party asked for some salt and he replied that he was still going around with the pepper and would get to it after. He could just say “sure no problem”. It was just the tone and choice of words, there was always some explanation that we found extremely patronizing. Not to mention he lectured my partner about how an old fashion drink is actually made when we just asked for a large ice cube and not small crushed ones. I’m not sure if our server was just in a grumpy mood but it sure did rub off on our table, and frankly that kind of patronizing attitude is just not acceptable at a restaurant in Yorkville charging ~$100 a head.

Slightly disappointed because I was excited about trying this London style restaurant."
The Oxley,Pubs,"121 Yorkville Avenue Toronto, ON M5R 1C4 Canada",ON,43.6705763,-79.393082,3,"We came here for brunch and got the English breakfast and eggs Benedict. The food was okay and a bit pricey considering the eggs Benny didn’t come with any sides.

The atmosphere and service were great though. We were seated outside in the back, which had a nice, cozy feel and the service was excellent."

Zezafoun Syrian Cuisine,Syrian,"4 Manor Road E Toronto, ON M4S 1P8 Canada",ON,43.7026971,-79.3970798,4,"This famiily owned eatery that has positive vibes.  Friendly service and courteous hosts. Middle eastern cuisine that has a Syrian touch. Food is fresh and flavors are unique, albeit, the taste is little bland as compared to other reataurants that offer similar food.

Tamarind based cocktails are unique. Mezze platter was fresh and tasty althoug a little expensive. Muhammara is a super hit. Molokia
tasted different but too sour( the leaf’s speciality) for our liking. Musaka
was average and so was the Shawarma platter. We liked the Hariseh better than the hyped  Volcano Kunafeh.

Overall a good  casual  family dining option around the midtown TO which may pinch your pocket a bit."
Zezafoun Syrian Cuisine,Syrian,"4 Manor Road E Toronto, ON M4S 1P8 Canada",ON,43.7026971,-79.3970798,5,"We tried Kebbeh Labanyeh (beef kibbeh in a cooked garlic yogurt sauce served with side rice) & Kabab Karaz (Beef Kabab marinated in black cherries sauce, topped with almonds and parsley. Served with bread, side salad).
The taste for both dishes was phenomenon.  Very different and flavorful. Portion of Kebbeh Labanyeh was small in my opinion (with 4 pcs of meat balls).
We also tried Kunafeh Volcano and it's a must try. Its a Kunafeh tart stuffed with homemade cream cheese (Qashta) topped with ice cream and covered with Ghazli (syrian cotton candy) and pistachio. Turkish coffee was also great.
Meal, cold drink, desert and warm drink would come down to nearly $40-50/per person.
I recommend this restaurant for unique taste of meal and ambiance."
Jin Dal Lae,Korean,"647 Bloor Street W Toronto, ON M6G 1L1 Canada",ON,43.6641278,-79.4151531,5,Waited for almost an hour. Worth the wait! Food is really yummy even the side dishes. Love the hot plate and cold noodles! Rice cake is just average. Will come back again to try more dishes!

kimchi fried rice,

seafood pancake,
pork belly bossam(smelled so good and tasted not oily),
stir fried spicy squid(remember you can order the portion for one person if you’d like),
stir fried sweet potato noodles (smelled       great, like sesame oil in it),
soft tofu stew with seafood (rich and tasty, the most delicious one I’ve ever had in Toronto)

Refreshing for a hot summer day. Side dishes were refilled by request. Seafood pancake was dense and crispy, highly recommend! The seollatang was also soothing and warm.

The karage chicken was great as well, I really enjoy the light batter they use, and the side sauces that come with it are all super unique and innovative."

Got some appetizers: Cheese Crabmeat Croquette and the Karaage Chicken Thighs. Good for sharing. Main dishes were the Honeycomb Katsu, Curry Katsu and the Japanese Katsu. For the choice of meat, I chose the Sweet Potato Cheese Katsu which had Pork Loin with Mozzarella and Mashed Sweet Potato. It was really good and VERY filling. The Katsu was very crispy. I really enjoyed my meal here!!"

We tried Garlic Chilli Chicken Katsu which was finger licking good and dont get me started on Miso Soup it was one of the best that I have ever had. Definitely a must visit if you are looking for exquisite Japanese food and hospitality."
Tabule Restaurant,Middle Eastern,"2009 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4S 1Z8 Canada",ON,43.7009583,-79.3968715,5,We had a really good experience here.  The food was amazing and everyone working there were attentive.  We really enjoyed the baba ganoush and found ourselves coming back to it between bites of the other things we ordered.  The grilled entrees had that smokey flavor for the grill that added to the flavors perfectly.  There’s a lot of shareable plates so if you have a group of friends that want to try out many different things consider coming to Tabule.
Tabule Restaurant,Middle Eastern,"2009 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4S 1Z8 Canada",ON,43.7009583,-79.3968715,4,"We have dined  here many times and nice to see the same quality and service maintained over the years. Restaurant has even better vibes post the renovation few years ago.

Authentic middle eastern food and taste and quality have been same fo years. Warak Enab, Arnabeets, sample platter and the Tabule salad all taste good( although the pita  and arnabeets have changed a bit)

Simplistic menu and reasonable prices ( a couple items are slightly overpriced)  . Staff is courteous and attentive.  Good dining option in mid town TO wherabouts."
Tabule Restaurant,Middle Eastern,"2009 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4S 1Z8 Canada",ON,43.7009583,-79.3968715,5,"Went here for lunch with a friend because we were in the mood to try a new cuisine. They are a Lebanese based restaurant, so we were pretty excited. When you walk in, the interior is very clean, modern, and bright.
To our surprise they were offering Winterlicious! (Although their restaurant wasn’t on the Winterlicious list of restaurants🤔). Regardless, this nice surprise elevated our experience. I ordered Lebanese coffee, as the server explained it is very similar to Turkish coffee (which I’m a fan of). It’s definitely lighter than Turkish coffee with strong cardamom hints.
We ordered the Mezza Sampler (Hummus, baba ghanouj, tabulé and falafel) and Halloumi Salad for starters. The portions were generous. I mean we were full from just the appetizers.
For mains we ordered a Kefta Burger and Salmon Kebab. The kefta burger was bursting with flavour and the grilled salmon wasn’t over cooked (yay!). Lastly, for dessert we ordered rice pudding and Knaffa Ashta. I personally loved the Knaffa Ashta, the custard was so creamy and flavourful but not too heavy.
All in all we had a great experience, and would love to return."

Had their hummus with meat, chicken liver and Kefta Bandura, which are my fav go-to dishes. I must say the hummus and chicken liver were on the drier side compared to before but I still love their food. The interiors are really gorgeous now with decent amount of seating. Great service as per usual with good priced portions/dishes. I also love their mint limeade. Thanks!"

Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,Mexican,"72 Kensington Avenue Toronto, ON M5T 2K1 Canada",ON,43.6544782,-79.4008249,5,"Possibly the best taco I've ever had.

I ordered only one blackened cod taco, because I was not that hungry. It was pretty big, I would only need two for a meal. The corn tortilla tasted very strongly of corn, and each of the toppings added freshness to the fish. The fish itself was freshly fried to perfection.

There are a few standing tables for guests to dine at, and a self serve salsa station.

Highly recommend this spot, it definitely lives up to the hype!"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,Mexican,"72 Kensington Avenue Toronto, ON M5T 2K1 Canada",ON,43.6544782,-79.4008249,5,"You want a good taco, come here!  They don't have chairs, but you don't need one since the food is so good that by the time you set, you've already devoured it :)
The fish taco is my favourite, but they also offer amazing ceviche and smoked meats, and I loved their cactus juice.  From crispy shrimp to swordfish or blackened fish, you won't be disappointed at Seven Lives!"

The food is always tasty, and the menu has so much variety to choose from. We usually get a bunch of plates to share which allows us to taste a  bit of everything. My favorite dish is the old school gnocchi which I’ve had at least 15 times and it always tastes like the first time I discovered it. Chefs kiss!"

I found antipasto options so satisfying. Especially enjoyed octopus dish which was accompanied by baby potatoes, kalamata olives, and capers. The crispy texture of the potato skins was a highlight. The dressing of oyster mushroom & arugula salad was so delicious. I ordered the classic spaghetti with meatballs. While I prefer my pasta al dente, I felt that it could have used an additional 30 seconds of cooking time. I liked the gnocci more despite creamy sauces typically being a tad heavy for my taste. The stuff was friendly, the interior had interesting details (like the plates, the mirrored wall and the ceiling light ) and our night was pleasant."

Each plate was well made, bringing that old country Italian flavour to the heart of St.Clair West. Portions are well sized.

The location would also be great for small parties and events

Only reco for this place, they need more beer options on their menu, however I appreciated that each beer glass was chilled."

The portion definitely got smaller, and the sauce is not as rich as it’s used to. Our pasta came a bit cold so it was not as enjoyable. Also, barely any cheese!

Tried their calamari for the first time, it was good but nothing special. All in all, a bit disappointed with this visit. Hopefully they can be more consistent next time."

The service is very professional and upbeat. We went for brunch and had two dishes and drinks. Both were large portions and fresh. The eggs were free-range and you can taste the richness of it. The pizza dough was not chewy but had a nice texture.  The seats at the smaller tables were not comfortable though, the bench on the side looked more comfy. The kitchen is open. It is noisy but you can see which dishes you want to order. And it was tough... They all look good!"

It was such an amazing birthday celebration at Byblos Downtown!
I can rate this restaurant as one of the top 5 restaurants in Toronto and GTA.
Everything they have was simply amazing; the staff, the food and the overall atmosphere.
The staff are very welcoming and so nice. We almost felt we have our own waiter as she taking good care of us ☺️
For the food, we truly enjoyed every bite of all the dishes we had, both starters and mains. I can confidently say that their lamb shoulder dish is one of the best and delicious dishes I had in my life.
We loved the atmosphere of the place with the details of the interior design and furniture. 👍🏼👍🏼"

We were lucky to be served and helped by Tyler, the bar manager/our server. He was so helpful and kind and attentive, it really impressed us. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience not only because the food looked/tasted great, but Tyler also contributed to a majority of our experience. He managed the bar, our table as well as 2 other tables, and he managed to remember our order, dietary restrictions and was even considerate enough to tell us that the short rib was cooked in red wine but he’ll make sure ours isn’t due to us having dietary restrictions (alcohol free halal meat) overall great experience, can’t wait to come back here to celebrate more occasions ☺️"

We arrived a bit early so left we could see that they were preparing for a live music. Just the atmosphere that need a bit effort to be more inviting."
Budapest Restaurant,Hungarian,"2183 Danforth Ave Toronto, ON M4C 1K4 Canada",ON,43.6861678,-79.3100321,4,"We came to Danforth to run some errands and came across this Budapest restaurant with great Google reviews so we decided to give it a try.

It’s Tuesday lunch time around noon. The place was filled with 4-5 tables of customers.

We grabbed a seat at one of the tables and ordered 2 Schnitzels and a beer.

The schnitzels were really good!! Fried just right - crisp and tasty. Not dry at all! It tasted so authentic (according to my friend from Europe).

I think that’s what makes Toronto amazing - the fact that we can always find good, authentic food in different parts of Toronto.

Gave it 4-stars due to the rather “cold” service. We felt that the servers didn’t bother to make us feel welcomed. It was very transactional without much engagement - sit down, order taken, here’s your food, pay. Or maybe I shouldn’t expect too much 🤔"
Budapest Restaurant,Hungarian,"2183 Danforth Ave Toronto, ON M4C 1K4 Canada",ON,43.6861678,-79.3100321,5,"As an Hungarian-American who now lives in Toronto, I can honestly say it's a blessing that if I'm craving Hungarian foods, I can actually go somewhere to get it rather than cook it myself (sometimes you know, we just don't want to cook after a long day!).  The food here is authentic, delicious, and comes in huge portions (if that's your thing).  The service is always friendly and I'm assuming that if one goes and doesn't really know Hungarian food, they'd be knowledgeable as well to walk you through the menu.  Go there and make sure to get the langos!"
Budapest Restaurant,Hungarian,"2183 Danforth Ave Toronto, ON M4C 1K4 Canada",ON,43.6861678,-79.3100321,5,"There are many things to like about the place: the food, the theming, and the service.

We wanted to sample many dishes that are close to authentic as possible, so we ended up ordering the Budapest-platter ($44.95) for two. In the platter, you get 2 sides, a porkchop, 2 slices of Debreceni sausages, 2 types of Schnitzel, and a cabbage roll. There was a good variety of food present in the platter as well as very generous portions. It was listed as good for 2 people, but I believe it can be spread out to even accommodate 3 people.

There was a good amount of thought put into the interior's theming. Laminated pictures of sights and attractions of Budapest, Hungary were present at the table to give a good perspective and insight into Hungarian culture.

Lastly, I have no complaints, and have only praises to the service we received while dining here. We were attended to dutifully, and we had the best of time dining."

Papyrus,Egyptian,"337 Danforth Avenue Toronto, ON M4K 1N7 Canada",ON,43.6771361,-79.353287,5,"I have often passed by Papyrus and made a note to try it. The idea of Egyptian food on the Danforth was so intriguing I didn't know what to expect. With a mostly vegan and vegetarian menu I had to really coax my partner to give it a go. Of course we had to order the two meat dishes on the menu, namely the beef hawawshi and the chicken hawawshi. Both were very good and nicely spiced. Wanting to try more we alo ordered the full and tameya platter that came with lentil hummus and salads baladi and bread. The Tameya were so good we ended up ordering a side dish of 3 more. And the owner who helped to serve us and who was so kind and took time to explain everything and reccomend what order to try things etc. Also brought us a small bowl of Koshari to try (Egypt's National dish). Wow what amazing flavour! The layers of rice, lentils, pasta, tomato sauce with chickpeas and caramelized onions spiced to perfection made this a stand out dish for certain. We already agreed at the outset to try dessert so we needed to pace ourselves and brought some of the hawawshi home. So we split a Bird Nest Konafa and it was simply remarkable! Light vermicelli pastry filled with pistachios ( and exceptionally good quality ones at that) with a hint of coconut! We had to admit next time we are each getting our own! It was that good. Not too sweet just ever so flavorful. Like everything we had the textures and layers of flavour made this a truly wonderful meal experience. And my carnivore companion had to admit how much he loved the vegan and vegetarian cuisine. We also had 3 glasses of wine. There is no doubt at all that we will be back. And if you are vegan or vegetarian this is a must try restaurant in Toronto for you. Be warned however that it is small seats about 20 or so. So make a reservation!"

The food was absolutely delicious and we devoured it all. I personally haven’t had Egyptian before but will be back here in a heartbeat. For a lunch for 4 of us, it was only about $60. Such great value."

We called to make a reservation & good we did as seating is limited and it was very busy. Immediately, the service was friendly and welcoming. The server did an amazing job explaining the specials of the day. For appetizers, we got the Cajun muscles and lobster/shrimp bisque - both were absolutely delicious and savoury. For mains we got the fresh fish of the day and the shrimp creole, the sea bass was so well made and honestly the best tasting fish we ever tried. The portions aren’t huge but with an appetizer you’re very likely to get full. The owner or manager was present and he was so kind and attentive. We would definitely come back for some amazing seafood and I’ll be recommending this to my friends and family."

New Orleans Seafood & Steakhouse,Seafood,"267 Scarlett Road Toronto, ON M6N 4L1 Canada",ON,43.6777473,-79.5062584,5,"A fine dining experience that delivers amazing cajun flavours in an unexpected location!

I’ve lived in the area most of my life and have always felt the area was lacking when it came to restaurant options, even in regards to take out. I probably have driven past New Orleans Seafood & Steakhouse hundreds of times coming home and never noticed it until I saw it pop up on google maps when looking for cajun restaurants in Toronto. Boy am I happy it did, because this has become easily the best restaurant in the area when factoring everything.

First the location and service. The location is a lacking point, as the restaurant itself is very small and probably fits less than 30 people max. Although its size, it doesn’t get too loud in the restaurant and the interior design is very formal and  has a hint of New Orleans culture. As for service, the family running this restaurant are incredibly kind and welcoming, the person I presume to be the owner was around making jokes with patrons and checking in on all of us, ensuring our glasses are full, and all requests are answered.

Now onto the food, man does this place hit the spot. I’ve wanted to try cajun food for years but never thought a place like this would be so close to home. We started our meal with the crab cakes that do come in a serving of two.

Without asking, we were presented our crab cakes on separate plates perfectly plated for myself and my date. Fried to perfection, tender inside but not mushy. Accompanied by a bouquet of fresh veggies, this was a great start to the meal alongside the complimentary bread.

Onto our main dish, there were a couple options on the menu I wanted to try, but I felt Jambalaya had to be my first deep dive into cajun food. This dish, although being priced highly, is a hefty portion and easily feeds 2-3 people. The rice, the sausages, the various seafood, all of it was just amazing and fulfilled all my expectations and maybe even exceeded them.

This restaurant has become the best fine dining restaurant in the area to me and will now become my go to spot for going out to celebrate special occasions."

The lemon French toast, I think, was a bit too lemony. Would love for the chef to try an orange French toast.

French toast tasted so flavorful with cream cheese and berries. Steak and eggs was also amazing since the steak was juicy and fatty. Fantastic option for meat lovers! Great portion of brunch as always. However it would have been better if there are some seasonal specials for brunch as well. Looking forward to seeing new dishes on the menu.
Insomnia Restaurant & Lounge,Lounges,"563 Bloor Street W Toronto, ON M5S 1Y6 Canada",ON,43.6650421,-79.4107779,3,"I recently visited the Insomnia Lounge in Toronto and had a mixed experience. While the staff was generally friendly and attentive, I did have an unpleasant interaction with a server who assumed we would prefer a cheaper vodka option. However, they were quick to correct their mistake and provided us with the premium vodka we desired.

The food at Insomnia Lounge was enjoyable, but the wait time for our dishes left something to be desired. It would have been nice to see the kitchen keep up with the bustling atmosphere of the lounge.

One of the standout features of the establishment was the lighting, which was truly exceptional and added a unique touch to the ambiance. However, the decor in the back of the restaurant could use some updating, particularly the odd red sofa chairs that seemed out of place with the overall aesthetic.

Despite some positives, the negatives of my experience at Insomnia Lounge have led me to the decision not to return. While the staff was mostly pleasant and the lighting was a highlight, the presumptuous server and lengthy wait times for food detracted from the overall experience. Additionally, the decor in certain areas could benefit from an upgrade to better align with the vibe of the rest of the lounge.

In conclusion, Insomnia Lounge in Toronto has potential but fell short in some key areas during my visit. If you're considering a night out at this establishment, be prepared for both hits and misses."

Their decoration in the restaurant was cute, especially since they light up a lot of small bulbs, which makes the whole space look cozy.

We ordered a chicken and coleslaw sandwich and a steak salad. I enjoyed the steak salad very much, and it was very delicious and unique.  My partner also really liked his sandwich, and the fries were delicious too.

Our server was also excellent. She answered our questions about the meal and was very knowledgeable about everything.  They served fast and were super friendly; I appreciated them.
We will be back very soon, for sure!"

I ordered the chicken pot pie which was yummy though a little small. It comes either with the Garden or Caesar salad and I had the latter which was good. My hubby had the burger (also kinda small) but it was tasty as well. The portion of fries was quite large. The sticky toffee pudding was amazing!!"
Conspiracy Pizza,Pizza,"858 Eglinton Avenue E Toronto, ON M4G 2B6 Canada",ON,43.7136851,-79.3654162,5,"These guys are good. Not cheap on pepperoni either. When you order on Uber, they deliver with their own in-house professionals that keep the pie nice and hot. Unlike Uber drivers that dgaf and don’t have big enough sacks for pizza anyhow."
Conspiracy Pizza,Pizza,"858 Eglinton Avenue E Toronto, ON M4G 2B6 Canada",ON,43.7136851,-79.3654162,5,"I've ordered and picked up pizza from here. Picking it up is a better option because it somehow tastes better. They make a great pizza. The crust towards the edges is perfectly crispy. It's a thin crust, which is what I prefer and I didn't need to ask for it to be well done. They load the toppings on, you never feel like you didn't get enough. You can taste the quality in the meats and the freshness in the veggies. It's decently a place you need to try. Keep in mind that if you go to pick it up it's inside a unit with 3 other businesses."
Conspiracy Pizza,Pizza,"858 Eglinton Avenue E Toronto, ON M4G 2B6 Canada",ON,43.7136851,-79.3654162,5,"Really enjoyed this pizza, we had two different ones, the white sauce Cowspiracy pizza was our favourite of the two, but the Canadian was also very good.  Having the different sauces and cheeses from a typical pizza really added something to the flavours.  We split the two 10"" pizzas between us, with some left over. The toppings are so hearty they are very filling!"

Menu is fun as far as names go, and I appreciate a brand who puts some creative twists into things!

We were not disappointed. 2 small pizzas to go, one was gluten free and I'm told was amazing. Crust was fresh, fluffy, ingredients taste fresh + pricing is great for made to order ""different"" types of pizzas.

Definitely worth going to try it out!"

Stock Bar,Steakhouses,"2388 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4P 3J5 Canada",ON,43.7092238,-79.3991736,5,"From start to finish our visit was top-notch. Our table wasn’t ready in time but the hosts were appreciative of our patience and we were fine to wait. The culinary experience was delightful to the taste buds as well as appealing to our eyes. What really made the night exceptional was our awesome server Melina who was genuine, outgoing, and made several great recommendations geared to our preferences - she rocks! Will definitely return and bring friends."
Stock Bar,Steakhouses,"2388 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4P 3J5 Canada",ON,43.7092238,-79.3991736,5,"We were at Stock Bar this past Sunday and truly we have nothing but good things to say. We arrived at our reservation time and were seated immediately. No waiting around - which is nice as sometimes even when you have a reservation you still have to wait for your table. So we had very little interaction with the hostess but she was pleasant enough. We were a bit nervous as we had read some of the reviews that the service was lacking so we had braced ourselves for a subpar experience and we were just hoping the food would outshine any negative experiences. However this was NOT our experience at all. We had EXCEPTIONAL service from our server Jessica. If the management team at Stock read these reviews, Jessica was amazing. She was attentive, quick and very friendly. It was just my husband and I and we were seated between 2 parties of 6+ people that she was also waiting on and she was extremely on the ball. Reviews and ratings are obviously subjective to your own experiences and I think restaurants should aim to have some level of consistency amongst their staff so I do hope there are more servers like Jessica at Stock because she really did make the experience enjoyable.

As for the food we order the:
- Shrimp and Lobster Roll (4/5 the bread was perfectly soft and toasted, the lobster tasted fresh)
- Pancakes (5/5 the pancakes were THE highlight for me, they were so soft and fluffy and served warmed - they were great)
- Stock Burger (4.5/5 the meat was unreal - one of the best burgers at a restaurant we ever had, knock .5 because it doesn’t come with a side)
- Truffle Fries (4/5 they were standard fries, really tasty with the truffle and Parmesan on top and the highlight was the truffle Mayo, I did find them a bit expense at $22)
- Brownie (5/5, soft and warm inside, not to sweet which was perfect with the sweet ice cream)"
Stock Bar,Steakhouses,"2388 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4P 3J5 Canada",ON,43.7092238,-79.3991736,3,"I heard good things about this place online and we decided to try it out. We ordered the albacore tuna tartare, romaine salad, cavatelli pasta, truffle fries, and ribeye to share amongst the three of us.

Nothing to be impressed by all the dishes were fine but definitely did not justify their prices."
Stock Bar,Steakhouses,"2388 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4P 3J5 Canada",ON,43.7092238,-79.3991736,5,"Our friends invited us here for a brunch and after checking the reviews I was skeptical about this place. But honestly I don’t know why people wrote such bad comments.

We booked a table on a rooftop patio but unfortunately it was raining so they relocated us inside which wasn’t as cute but it’s okay

The food was good , everyone was satisfied with their choice, thanks to your server who helped us to decide what we wanted as well.

We had 5 dishes , 2 beers and 2 cocktails which costed us around 200$ plus tips. Which is not bad , yes it isn’t cheap but we knew what to expect"
Stock Bar,Steakhouses,"2388 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4P 3J5 Canada",ON,43.7092238,-79.3991736,3,"Restaurant and atmosphere is beautiful. But the dishes are nothing spectacular.

The pizza was very underwhelming. The cheese was not melted and very rubbery, almost like cheese curds. Although  It was thin and had no structure, I couldn’t cut through with knife due to dryness.

The seared steak tartare was decent. But the bread was very hard.

The seafood pasta taste was good. A tad on the salty side and some of the pasta was dried. The amount of seafood was too little for the price.

Cocktail was quite strong, but taste was not to our liking. Also it is very expensive for a cocktail at $18.

We waited a very long time for order to be taken as well as getting bill. The food also took very long to arrive, the mains arrived almost an hour after we sat down. The service was very basic and not too friendly overall."

Overall, excellent food.

Bolan Thai Cuisine,Thai,"709 Mount Pleasant Road Toronto, ON M4S 2N4 Canada",ON,43.7066343,-79.3892106,5,I was looking for something different and I never really had Thai food before except for some fast food place and this was exactly what I was looking for. Small quaint little place where the staff are friendly and personable. The combination of curry and if I remember correctly coconut milk was a great sensation for the taste buds. It was so good that I had to go back and it was just as good the second time. I am going to keep going back until I've tried everything on the menu at least once.
Bolan Thai Cuisine,Thai,"709 Mount Pleasant Road Toronto, ON M4S 2N4 Canada",ON,43.7066343,-79.3892106,5,Their food is so good also the presentation makes it look more fancy. Nice portion with acceptable price. Friendly service👍🏻

The ambiance and decor are nice and cozy. The service is super friendly and prompt, and the food is so good. Fresh ingredients, super flavourful.

Union Social Eatery,American (Traditional),"21 Saint Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M4V 1K6 Canada",ON,43.6874066,-79.3949353,4,"My partner and I had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant for the first time, and overall, it was a pleasant experience with a few highlights and some room for improvement. The restaurant boasted a delightful atmosphere, creating a cozy and inviting ambiance for a relaxed evening.

The service was commendable - the servers were exceptionally friendly and attentive throughout our meal, adding a positive touch to the overall dining experience.

We decided to try their popular chicken tenders and fish and chips. While the chicken tenders seemed to be a crowd-favorite, we were slightly disappointed by the dryness of the chicken. Though they provided some sauce on the side, the tenders' inherent dryness made it a bit difficult to enjoy fully. However, on the flip side, the fish and chips truly stood out. The portion size was more than generous, offering two servings of deliciously crispy fried fish. The fish itself was cooked to perfection - crunchy on the outside, while the flesh remained tender and flavorful on the inside. The accompanying portion of chips was excellent, adding a delightful touch to the overall dish.

One noteworthy aspect of this restaurant is their enticing happy hour deal, available from 3 pm to 5 pm and 8 pm until closing time. Regrettably, we visited during dinner hours, and consequently, we missed out on these attractive deals. Nevertheless, the ample portion sizes of the meals made up for it, leaving us feeling satisfied and content with the value we received.

All in all, the dining experience was positive, with the standout being the delectable fish and chips. Although the chicken tenders were a bit disappointing, the restaurant's overall performance and inviting ambiance left a good impression."
Union Social Eatery,American (Traditional),"21 Saint Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M4V 1K6 Canada",ON,43.6874066,-79.3949353,4,"My boyfriend and I went for the summerlicious menu and overall it was pretty yummy. We made a lunch reservation for 12 pm on the dot. We both started with the parmesan truffle fries which were very good and a decently big portion, the only complaint is that they didn’t use real parmesan.

For our mains I got the ace high club and he got the tofu tacos with salad. The sandwich comes with a side of fries but i chose to do a caesar salad instead. The sandwich and salad were pretty good. The market salad that came with the tacos was a little too sweet and the tacos weren’t as flavourful as he would’ve liked (he is a sauce monster).

We chose the seasonal creme brulee (which we were told was just vanilla flavoured and not really seasonal unless vanilla is a summer seasonal flavour?) which he really enjoyed, and the apple pie jar. Pretty standard desserts, not gonna lie I was kinda full at this point and didn’t eat much of it.

Our waiter was a very nice and chill dude who provided great service and we got to choose our own seats as it wasn’t really busy at the time. Paid around $60-70 all together after tax and tip, so around $30-40 per person."
Union Social Eatery,American (Traditional),"21 Saint Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M4V 1K6 Canada",ON,43.6874066,-79.3949353,1,"We went for the Summerlicous menu and very much disappointed. I ordered the House Braised Sirloin Firecrackers (to die for) & tofu taco with salad. My girlfriend ordered the Parmesan Truffle Fries and chicken taco with salad. We ordered our dessert ahead of time and there seemed to be no problem. Once we were ready for our dessert, we were told they ran out and they only had 2 left for the day! The GM came and she was very defensive as we addressed our concern. She promised a discount but when we got our bill, no discount was given. We even asked the waitress to pack our left overs but she forgot to bring us doggy bags. We paid our bill with bad taste in our mouth. This location is definitely thumbs down!"
Union Social Eatery,American (Traditional),"21 Saint Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M4V 1K6 Canada",ON,43.6874066,-79.3949353,3,"Union Social Eatery is a great spot for a work lunch, with its nice location and laid-back atmosphere. However, if you're planning on dining here, it's best to arrive at noon or before, as it can get quite busy quickly. Despite the crowds, the service at Union Social Eatery is great, and you don't need a reservation to be seated promptly.

During my visit, my server got my wing order wrong, and unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to return or cancel before lunch ended. This was disappointing, but it didn't ruin the overall experience.

If you're looking for a spot to catch up with colleagues or friends over drinks, Union Social Eatery is definitely worth considering. While the food didn't exceed expectations, the drinks are well-crafted, and the overall atmosphere is quite inviting.

In summary, Union Social Eatery is a decent option for a work lunch or drinks with friends. While the service is great, it's important to arrive early to avoid the crowds. And while the food may not be the main draw, the drinks are worth checking out. I would consider returning, but perhaps for a more casual and relaxed outing."
Union Social Eatery,American (Traditional),"21 Saint Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M4V 1K6 Canada",ON,43.6874066,-79.3949353,4,"Tried out with a friend for Summerlicious. The app was delicious: crispy brussel sprouts with bacon and a generous serving! It almost filled me and ok to share. For Main we tried was butternut squash ravioli which was cheesy, but a bit on the oily side. They were out of creme brûlée so we had key lime which was fine; standard stuff, not too much coconut.
Service was hospitable.
I did not care for the atmosphere, since it was incredibly loud/echoing and the table was wide, so we felt far from each other. Giant tv with sports over big bar. It’s a kinda industrial feel, and there is a garage door which was open to the sidewalk patio. Very humid when we were there so that didn’t help. You’re beside parked cars there.
You go through 2 doors to enter and accessible (but bathrooms downstairs)
Lots if regular pub type stuff and gluten free offerings and vegetarian friendly."

It is not always very fast when they are busy so be prepared to wait a bit (10 mins). This place is affordable, I got 4 baos for only $22.00!! This is incredibly cheap. The bao is big enough and one can fill me up for a meal."

If you're planning on going here, make sure you bring a lot of money with you. The only drawback is everything is really expensive. Aside from that, this place is certainly an experience with numerous markets and restaurants. If there is a special occasion I would definitely consider coming here, although I would avoid busy hours because this place gets crowded at times."

Overpriced grocery items, but surprisingly, the hand or machine made pastas are worth it since they are made right there and then so can't go wrong. Amazing atmosphere if you want to go with a much smaller group as there is so much to discover and explore."

This is a fun filled day where everything is fresh, and great tasting for all. There are so many different areas as you walk though and experience unique foods like you were in Italy vibe. Great customer service and everyone seemed happy to be there.

We seated ourselves for a bite to eat and ordered some delicious Italian cuisine. The service was on point and we enjoyed the experience overall. Can’t wait to check it out again!"
Eataly Toronto,Italian,"55 Bloor Street W Manulife Centre Toronto, ON M4W 1A6 Canada",ON,43.6696176,-79.3886462,3,The marketplace and specialty store are very cool. You can find a great variety of special Italian food items. The restaurant was average and a little underwhelming for the price. The lasagna was good. The burrata pizza sauce was a little water and soggy but tasted good. The best part was the Rossa foccacia.  It's a good spot for small bites and getting some specialty groceries but probably not worth the price for the restaurant.
Little Sister,Indonesian,"2031 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4S 1Z9 Canada",ON,43.7016173,-79.3969364,4,"Fun creative dishes designed to be shared with friends over drinks. Between the 2 of us, we ordered 5 dishes and it was the perfect amount. I enjoyed everything, but didn't have any standout favourites.

Service was excellent - our server recommended cocktails and the food came out staggered at a comfortable pace. We actually stayed there chatting well after our meal was finished and nobody made us feel rushed (it was a quiet night, but still appreciated).

I would definitely come back to try more from their menu."
Little Sister,Indonesian,"2031 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4S 1Z9 Canada",ON,43.7016173,-79.3969364,5,"Phenomenal tasting food and service. Other reviews say portions are a bit small for the price, but we split the shrimp curry, nasi goreng, and 6 skewers between two people and it was the perfect amount of food for ~$35 each. The seasoning and spices in the dishes are very well done and make the food taste amazing. It’s well worth the price"
Little Sister,Indonesian,"2031 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4S 1Z9 Canada",ON,43.7016173,-79.3969364,5,I’ve been wanting to try Little Sister and finally got the opportunity to go with my sister! Great atmosphere with exceptional service. Bartender was constantly crafting amazing drinks and the main server was delivering terrific service and super friendly. The food is a bit on the pricier side but definitely worth it. Lots of great sharing plates and options! I personally had the sangria and little brother cocktail both 10/10. I can’t wait to return to try some more :)
Little Sister,Indonesian,"2031 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4S 1Z9 Canada",ON,43.7016173,-79.3969364,2,"Food is very plain. Everything tasted like it was very minimally seasoned. Nothing was outright bad, but lacked flavour. The lamb satay was probably the least flavoured dish we ordered. Portions are also extremely tiny. All the skewers we got were 1 bite, maybe 2 max, and I’d say that’d be smaller bites. The drinks were 17-19$ for like a vodka martini which is insanely priced. Service was decent. It’s a pretty small place and kind of cramped. Very dark inside so hard to see. Overall, it was a very ok experience, but not somewhere I’d ever go back to."

We've been to a bunch of ""top restaurants"" in Toronto, and Yukashi really stands out. Each dish in the tasting menu was beautiful, creative, fresh and (most importantly) delicious. The pictures really don't do the food justice. My wife is pescatarian was they were able to accommodate by creating a great substitute for the wagyu and a couple other meat items.

We didn't have much experience with sake, and decided to add the sake pairing for the full experience. It was a great addition, and we loved how each sake complimented the paired food. Watching each dish prepared in front of us was an amazing experience, with great attention to detail from Chef Izutsu and his team. I really can't say enough about our memorable experience and the delicious food at Yukashi."
Yukashi Japanese Cuisine,Japanese,"643A Mount Pleasant Road Toronto, ON M4S 2M9 Canada",ON,43.7049457,-79.3886153,5,"Hello from San Francisco! We had a pleasant experience with Chef Daisuke on July 5th. Congrats on the Michelin star by the way! Daisuke has his process down to a tee. Everyone worked well together and are involved in the whole dining process. There wasn’t much waste, if any. The price tag was a little higher than expected, but it seems to be a result of rising cost of living and importing ingredients straight from his hometown in Japan. You do get to enjoy wagyu, uni, and foie gras as part of your 9 courses. The wasabi are grind fresh by Daisuke - you usually don’t see real fresh wasabi. Other items worth highlighting are their toro and smoked hamachi. The toro was just so fatty and delicious. I feel like all hamachi should be smoked after trying it here. Can’t forget the dessert at the end! It’s really expensive to buy it on your own. He used this large knife to cut it (definitely got everybody’s attention). The melon was juicy and literally melted in my mouth before I even start chewing. Amazing experience.

Keep in mind the head chef is busy in the beginning. Don’t think and just enjoy your food. He will have time to converse with everyone later. It’s not just your experience but everyone else’s. It’s easy for other guests to ruin the overall experience but we made it through ours. Thanks again Daisuke and for taking a pic with us!"

I don't have anything negative to say about Yukashi, everything was perfect! Presentation is incredible, ambiance is warm and inviting, and the food itself is top top quality.

First, half of the items on their menu wasn’t available today but they were apologetic and let us know what wasn’t available.

As a result, parking can be a little hard to come by but every once in a while, a spot out front opens up and there is a Green P lot about a block away.

The owner, Faris and his partner are extremely friendly and kind. They went out of their way to ensure my family and I had a great dining experience. I would highly recommend trying this spot if you are looking for a halal brunch spot with a variety of options. Also, the Mango-Strawberry Lemonade is really delicious and not too sweet."

I had a chicken sandwich— my coworkers had the Nashville chicken eggs Benedict and it looked phenomenal, the portion was huge in comparison to other breakfast spots.

Kiara was our server, she was so friendly and accommodating! She recommended a drink and I ended up trying / LOVING it. Would definitely recommend her choice of the mango strawberry lemonade. She was great.

Really enjoyed our meal & will definitely be back"

We mostly had seafood. They were good but a little overcooked. My seafood saffron risotto’s scallops were very over cooked but the shrimps were perfect. The seafood salad’s seafood was also overcooked but they were refreshing. Mussels were perfect. Veal with lemon sauce was good but maybe the piece was too thin. Overall pleasant experience."

I went there just for brunch but turns out it’s an authentic Italian place with all sorts of class and beauty. I ordered a brunch course followed by fruits and cheese and paired it with a glass of Rose. Absolutely loved the bar tender / server Jawahar and his service.
It was only me and I must say they treated me the best. I am going back with my entire crew. Loved every bit of it. Toronto is showing its good old kind Canadian face again. ❤️❤️❤️"

The owner is amazing, super welcoming and cool, the server was amazing, fantastic stuff.
Only 2 issues,  pasta portions are small and i wish they served free bread with the olive oil."
Kaiseki Yu-zen Hashimoto,Japanese,"6 Garamond Court Toronto, ON M3C 1Z5 Canada",ON,43.7262091,-79.335554,5,"What do you get a guy who has everything?  An elite birthday dinner at Kaiseki Yu-zen!  The experience was exquisite from start to finish. The entire restaurant holds just three tables.  Each table is set in a separate and cozy room emulating the traditional ""tatami"" feel with western seating.  Our server was impeccably professional, friendly, thorough and knowledgeable with every detail of our meal.  Each dish was immaculately plated.  I'd tell you to avoid a ""spoiler alert"" by skipping the photos, but your visual and taste experience will change with the meat, seafood and vegetables in season at the time. If you want a fine dining experience like no other, this is the place."
Kaiseki Yu-zen Hashimoto,Japanese,"6 Garamond Court Toronto, ON M3C 1Z5 Canada",ON,43.7262091,-79.335554,5,"Truly an experience where you’re transported outside of Toronto and into a traditional Kaiseki in Japan. From the moment you walk to the front of the restaurant the cherry blossoms outside the building bloom (as i went in late April. Just as they were blooming). There’s a magnificent entrance and walk to your dining room. As for the meal. The flavors slowly build up as the night goes on, each dish adding a bit more complexity than the last. From the food to the impeccable service, it’s an experience you will never forget. Amazing memories."
Kaiseki Yu-zen Hashimoto,Japanese,"6 Garamond Court Toronto, ON M3C 1Z5 Canada",ON,43.7262091,-79.335554,5,"An absolutely perfect kaiseki experience, I’m confident to say this was the best I’ve had outside of Japan. From the very beginning, the attention to detail is present. The staff immediately greet you and walk you to your seating area. As you make your way into the restaurant, the decor and ambiance of really pops out. Each decorative piece works as a whole to make you feel like you’ve been transported to Kyoto and prepares you for the work of art that is their kaiseki tasting menu. Even the movement of the servers showcased careful poise with no wasted movement, as each dish was placed with such care and love and a respectful bow as they enter and leave the room.

They really have mastered the art quite well, as each dish stimulates all five of your senses individually. Each course itself is a work of art in its own right, the textures of each dish work well individually and together, feel like a harmonious symphony that doesn’t overpower you. I must give kudos to their house made sesame tofu, the texture of that dish was a personal favourite of mine. Their steamed dish also whetted your appetite as when you uncover it, the balance of the vegetables and red snapper emit a delicate scent that is is a stark contrast with the umami of the mingled broth formed at the bottom. Needless to say, each dish was absolutely delicious and inventive. The chef has not only mastered his art but showcases how well thought out his combinations of seasonal ingredients are. The pairings of each dish and how they prepare them prove it’s Michelin status.

The only possible way they could have made the experience even more perfect would be to offer a seiza-style seating room with traditional tatami mats. I truly feel like that would make diners feel like they really have been transported to Japan. This has been my absolute favourite Michelin experience in Canada thus far. Kudos to all the staff!"
Kaiseki Yu-zen Hashimoto,Japanese,"6 Garamond Court Toronto, ON M3C 1Z5 Canada",ON,43.7262091,-79.335554,5,"Went for my boyfriend's 20th and it was phenomenal. The service and pace of the meal couldn't have been better and you leave feeling  full but not uncomfortable.

Food was delicious and a completely new sensory experience, each one was plated exquisitely. Truly a feast for all your senses! It's hard to pick a highlight out of all the course as each and every one had its unique quirks. I look forward to experiencing this in Japan when I get the chance.

Thank you to our gracious host, Haruna. She was kind, patient, and extremely informative. And of course thank you to Chef K who went out of his way to greet us at the end of the meal and talk us through the Kaiseki experience.

I look forward to coming back and trying their ever changing menu again. Gochisousama deshita!"

Flaming Stove,Middle Eastern,"21 Davisville Avenue Toronto, ON M4S 1G3 Canada",ON,43.6981825,-79.3957419,5,What a hidden gem. Located in the back of this Hasty Market lies a wonderful shawarma shop. They make their own flatbread and it's so unique and delicious. Not your standard pita. I really enjoyed the different texture. I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap all dressed and they loaded it up! It's a hefty wrap. I got a couple of falafels broken up and added to the wrap and they soaked up some of the sauce to add a really nice flavour and consistency to the filling. Highly recommend.

The entire place is quite clean comparing to most of the corner stores. The food is decent but not overwhelming. The shawarma chicken is good. The salad is mediocre. This box is $20.

El Sazón de la Tia Flor,Mexican,"1549 O'Connor Drive Toronto, ON M4B 2V7 Canada",ON,43.714705,-79.3051946,4,"We happened to catch ordering some quick take out right before they were closing at 7PM. The lady was kind enough to take our orders around 10 minutes before the end of the day.

There were not a lot of menu options available to get at this time, and we were limited to ordering the Pastor Taco & I think the Chicken Taco. Both orders were good and looked good. The tacos came with 2 sauces.

Probably, the only minor thing I can comment on that did not go right was that the lady did not include any napkins/tissues in the take out bag. We would have appreciated having some included for our takeout because we had the tacos to go and ate it at a park somewhere else.

I will surely try to experience dining in some time in the future. The interiors were themed right, and the place was very homey. I also can only expect some good and personable service received from the restaurant."

We’ve tried the pastor, chorizo, carnitas, and carne ranchera. They used to give lime with the order but now you have to buy it. We also tried the birria soup it was $2 for a mini portion of it but my sister think it’s delicious. I remember they used to have delicious desserts too but they didn’t have anything last time we came to visit. I used to get the hot salsa too and it used to burn my mouth but I guess they watered it down now. Overall, it is $1 taco every Tuesday & Wednesday so what else can you ask for. 👍🏼"

Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,Ramen,"2057 Yonge St Toronto, ON M4S 2A2 Canada",ON,43.7021185,-79.3971239,3,"I’ve walked by this place many many times and have always wanted to try it. I finally gave in and made my take out order! I ordered the spicy veggie ramen ($19.05, around $2+ more than a meat option = $21.20 with tofu compared to a $16.95 for meat) and asked for tofu to be added since there wasn’t any protein in there (extra $2.15). Since I ordered it to go I was charged a $1 to go fee. (What????) Honestly after spending $25 (totally NOT worth it for a veggie bowl) I’m not sure I’d go back again. The noodles were really nice but honestly I thought the rest of the bowl was just okay in comparison to some other restaurants where I’ve tried ramen before. There was hardly any soup and the description on the menu lists that there’s broccoli included but I received none.
The service was also very slow. Maybe they were short staffed but I swear when I put my order through the gentleman said it would take minutes which turned into about 20+.  There was even a lady sat in there with her family that was complaining because their order was taking so long to come out. Also a little shocked to find out it’s a chain restaurant."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,Ramen,"2057 Yonge St Toronto, ON M4S 2A2 Canada",ON,43.7021185,-79.3971239,5,"I went to this ramen shop with my wife and two daughters.  The ramen was excellent.  The wait staff are also nice and friendly.  You can order different sizes of ramen bowls depending on how hungry you are, which is great because my daughters weigh less than a 100lbs so they can’t eat a large bowl of ramen.  The small bowl was plenty for them.  We will be back again the next time we are visiting Toronto."

I thought the ramen flavours were good but not excellent. It seems to be a bit on the tame side of flavor. A bit on the pricer side for what you get. Overall, not a bad place."

Black Camel,Sandwiches,"4 Crescent Road Toronto, ON M4W 1S9 Canada",ON,43.6772917,-79.3894791,5,"I absolutely love their sandwiches, and my absolute favorite has to be their mouthwatering roast beef sandwich with its delectable BBQ sauce. The combination of tender, succulent roast beef layered with the perfect balance of tangy and savory BBQ sauce creates a taste sensation that is simply irresistible. Each bite is a symphony of flavors that leaves me craving more.

Not only are their sandwiches incredibly tasty, but the quality of ingredients and attention to detail truly sets them apart. The roast beef is expertly cooked to perfection, tender and juicy with a hint of smoky flavor that pairs perfectly with the bold, rich BBQ sauce. The bread they use is always fresh and just the right amount of softness, providing the perfect vessel to hold all the delicious ingredients together.

If you're looking for something special and unique to tantalize your taste buds, I highly recommend trying their sandwiches."

There is a Tiny patio for eating outside. This place has been around for at least 10 years. It is constantly busy, but the wait wasn't bad, and the staff is Friendly.
Inside it's a utilitarian vibe. Now, back to the food. I think any foodies would love the sandwiches. In all my reviews, this is a top spot."

No washroom in sight. A good menue that is accommodating to almost everyone. I got decent service when I visited but since I only went once, I can’t exactly vouch for the service. I took their recommendation and got veggie roasted sandwich with pesto mayo and it was about $11. A little over priced but that’s midtown/downtown for you.

The veggies tasted fresh and the bun was nice and chewy, although not toasted. They could have added a little more sauce to it.

Overall, a good place to grab a filling on the go lunch."
Black Camel,Sandwiches,"4 Crescent Road Toronto, ON M4W 1S9 Canada",ON,43.6772917,-79.3894791,5,"Really excellent sandwiches. Cannot wait to try the beef brisket sandwich again but with toppings next time. The meat is tender and moist, and bun soaks up the delicious barbecue sauce. The camel BLT is a wonderful combination of classic flavours. It’s loaded with toppings but at its core, it’s still a great pesto chicken sandwich. The shop is tiny, only two 2-seater tables and a standing room counter. But the diners seem to eat as quickly as the sandwiches are prepared.

Update: 2nd visit was just as good. Pulled pork with caramelized onions and roast sweet peppers was delicious!"

This is a decent thai spot in the area. The presentation of the food and drinks were great and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere as well!

I thoroughly enjoyed the soft shell crab curry and highly recommend getting this item! the curry was delicious and i really liked how it paired with the crab!

the other dishes were okay. i felt like some could use a bit more flavour and some was a little too umami and salty for me. But that’s just my personal preference!

I did have a good time and enjoyed my dinner overall!"
Pii Nong Thai,Thai,"1677 Bayview Avenue Toronto, ON M4G 3C1 Canada",ON,43.7075984,-79.3756179,5,My favorite Thai restaurant in Toronto so far! This restaurant is quite so spacious and has nice intimate vibes where lots of foodies like me would love to visit often! Unique and creative menu with fantastic flavor. 3 of us went there on Thursday noon and we were so easy to find parking spot even though I was bit concern about its location at the beginning. We ordered many dishes and our server was so friendly to offer signature dishes based on our preference. Food came out so quick and services were excellent. Firstly we were so surprised by the way how they make the Thai mike tea with the shape of cute bear.Such a genius idea! Best beverage to start a meal here. So refreshing and  not too sweet at all.And I love the seasonal specialty (Durian Roti) so much which came with great portion of Durian and they taste so creamy which perfect for people who are big fans of Durian aand you couldn't find this any Thai restaurant. Soft crab curry also tasted surprisingly good and I fell in love with soft crabs since then😅. Pandan leaf chicken is also a dish which you couldn't easily find anywhere and I was so impressed with the idea how they marianate and grill the chicken while they were wrap with leaf. They are so juicy and tender with light scents of leaf. The owner is also talkative and passionate about different ideas for the food his restaurant offers. I believe that's why this Thai restaurant is so outstanding and should deserve a michelin star one day! Will definitely come back again!
Pii Nong Thai,Thai,"1677 Bayview Avenue Toronto, ON M4G 3C1 Canada",ON,43.7075984,-79.3756179,5,"I had a very pleasant dinner at pii Nong. The servers really managed to find a table for us even if the restaurant was very busy and we didnt have a reservation, so thank you very much for that.

I am usually not a big meat lover, but probably the ribs were the best dish of our meal, so tender and juicy!
Overall also the other items were very good. We had Nana Garden salad, chicken khao soi, pad thai and soft shell crab ( the last one was a bit pricy and portion small, but def good taste).
We finished our meal with thr durian roti that was excellent! Durian flavoured desserts are often very artificial flavoured, but this one tasted very fresh.

Overall very recommended 👌"

I saw the lobster taco on the menu and definitely will come back to try."

Wow! These tacos were an explosion of mouthwatering flavours and textures… Hands down the best I’ve had in town thus far.

We tried the Ceviche Del Dia, which was okay. Nothing particularly special about this dish, but the chips were fresh and very good.

For tacos, we tried the Carnitas on soft tortillas and the Pollo Tinga on hard shells . Both were great with a wonderful combination of garnishes and sauces. My personal favourite was the Pollo Tinga as it had a good bite to it and the guacamole on the side was nice.

It’s a small and very busy restaurant with dimmed lighting and a cozy feel. The older gentleman (bartender) who served us was attentive and friendly. I’d definitely return!"
Playa Cabana,Mexican,"111 Dupont Street Toronto, ON M5R 1V4 Canada",ON,43.6760364,-79.4011532,5,"The food here is incredible. I was so impressed and will definitely be back.

Their house hot sauces are so good! I put the milder one on everything (they’re deliciously spicy)!

We ordered the grilled corn and salsa and chips to start. The grilled corn was tasty, but missing the char I expected from grilled corn. The salsa was fresh and delicious, with a generous portion size of tortilla chips.

Tacos come as a set of 3/4, so we ordered a set of the shrimp and al pastor. Both were so good!!! The al pastor tacos pack a punch of flavour - the seasoning of the pork is spot on, plus the juicy sweetness of the grilled pineapple and slice of orange on top, mmm!The shrimp tacos were milder in flavour, but so juicy and so tasty! The fried taco shell was a nice touch.

We also tried the tres leches cake, which was massive (shared between two people) and not too sweet.

Incredible experience overall and definitely coming back to try the other tacos!"

The fried fish tacos were so big (which you think would be a good thing) it was honestly difficult to eat and wish we ordered the grilled option instead"
Bi Bim Bap,Korean,"950 Eglinton Avenue W Toronto, ON M6C 2C2 Canada",ON,43.7005343,-79.4287204,4,"Overall had a good experience.
The bi bin bap was good but I had the tofu version which was very different.
This tofu was lighter and softer. The dish also seemed low in salt.
They had mexican coke which was yummy.
The beef (not pork) tacos were delicious as were the dumplings.

The space is small but owner is accommodating to groups. Service is friendly and helpful.

Great price! Haven't paid under $25 for my own dish for a while!

Washrooms available downstairs.

Wouldn't recommend for wheelchair accessible, unless it's on the patio."

We ordered the beef bibimbap and the beef itself was so tender and soft. The apps were simple but yet delicious and affordable.

definitely will be coming back."

La Bella Managua,Latin American,"872 Bloor Street W Toronto, ON M6G 1M5 Canada",ON,43.6623086,-79.4250112,4,"Decent tasting food, fairly priced and excellent service. I order the “Fish of the day” which was Sea bass with white rice, avocado salad and green plantains. Sea bass was cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside moist in the inside, but it lacked in seasoning. I wasn’t too fond of the green plantain. However, the soup of the day “sea food soup” was amazing! It was the best dish overall. Lots of different kinds of sea food and bursting with flavour. Lastly, the Mojinica tasted like lemonade, no rum."
La Bella Managua,Latin American,"872 Bloor Street W Toronto, ON M6G 1M5 Canada",ON,43.6623086,-79.4250112,4,"Friendly service. Huge portions. I left so stuffed. The daily special seafood soup was good. The Yuccanadas tasted just like nachos with cheese and salsa. My favourite meal was the Pez Dorado (grilled mahi-mahi); very flavourful. The fish of the day (sea bass) was cooked beautifully, crispy on the outside, moist inside, however, it lacked seasoning. I found the Mojinica drink to be very tart and strong in mint, but light in rum. There are other dishes that I would love to try so I will be back."
La Bella Managua,Latin American,"872 Bloor Street W Toronto, ON M6G 1M5 Canada",ON,43.6623086,-79.4250112,5,"I love this place. A local brought me here 3 years ago when I moved to Toronto.

La Bella Managua,Latin American,"872 Bloor Street W Toronto, ON M6G 1M5 Canada",ON,43.6623086,-79.4250112,4,"Made a reservation and was glad I did, since the place was packed on a Friday night! I got the carne asada as my main and added the fried cheese. For the appetizer we got the fish ceviche and mussels. I've never had such tender mussels!! It was cooked so deliciously, we didn't waste a drop of the sauce and soaked it up with bread. The carne asada was not tough and had a good chew, but could've used more flavour. The ceviche was too sour for my liking. Everything was fresh and came piping hot. Only thing I wished was for a little more considerate service, after we paid we stayed a little longer to chat but they stopped serving us water. Although the staff are very friendly and didn't rush us to leave I still had a great time."
La Bella Managua,Latin American,"872 Bloor Street W Toronto, ON M6G 1M5 Canada",ON,43.6623086,-79.4250112,4,"This was our first time trying Nicaraguan food and we were impressed. The service was friendly and the servers greet you in Spanish. We enjoyed our food here, and we couldn’t finish everything as the main dishes were fairly big. Next time, we will do different appetizers so we can try more items on the menu. The polo jalapeño plate is cooked with coconut milk, which was delicious, but we expected it to be a bit more spicy. This dish wasn’t spicy at all considering that it’s supposed to come with jalapeños. We loved the mixed seafood ceviches. Beef Churrasco could have been a bit better as I’ve tried this type of dish before. Also, vegetables on this plate were very plain. Overall a great experience. Thank you ☺️"

Many thanks to our server- We asked if they use vegetable oil as I couldn't eat that due to my allergies and unfortunately they do use it. But really loved the fact that she didn't give up and suggested all the items that I could safely have  from the menu and suggested they can cook it in butter instead.

Vibrant eatery hidden in the interiors of midtown. They have huge place no shortage of seating but we always fancy the patio - rooftop.. Getting to the washroom is a bit of inconvinience as its located deep down in the basement. Cheerful atmosphere and the place is always packed.

Cocktails are one of the best and they also have a good collection of beers and serve seasonal local brews too. Food is average and can get better rotating menu and
also more vegan/vegetarian options.
Service has been up and down but just about there in general.

Parking is very limited and is challenge finding every visit.

We visited the Local at Vancouver location recently but prefer home base better 😊"

We went on a Friday at around 8pm, and had a feast. The grilled and fried calamari were to die for- best calamari in the city! Don’t waste your time anywhere else. The dips were amazing too. The menu was so pleasantly overwhelming, we wanted to order everything.
Some people on the table had the lamb rack and really enjoyed it too.
Be mindful that the portions are huge, and you’ll want to order everything!
Super fresh, super delicious and I cannot wait to go back!"
Pantheon Restaurant,Greek,"407 Danforth Avenue Toronto, ON M4K 1P1 Canada",ON,43.6774731,-79.3513408,5,"Without doubt this has been one of the most amazing experiences I have had in a Toronto restaurant in my 4 years here.
Food -Made with passion and care. Served hot or cold as the dish needs. And tasted delicious. And this is when we are vegetarians.
Service - Felt treated like a guest as cared for in small ways, like hot water, sugar.
When I mentioned that I was at the restaurant with my family visiting as a tourist they made the dinner special with honey cake on the house.
Had a very pleasant and memorable time and my family is going to remember this as one of the most special times they had while in Canada.
Thank you everyone at Pantheon for having such a high bar for customer service. I will definitely visit again and tell others to not miss this incredible experience.
This is the reason dining out is not just about food but an extraordinary experience!!"
Pantheon Restaurant,Greek,"407 Danforth Avenue Toronto, ON M4K 1P1 Canada",ON,43.6774731,-79.3513408,5,"My family and I have been going to Pantheon for years, as our choice to dine on the Danforth. There are many quality Greek restaurants in the area and I would encourage everyone to try as many as possible to support local businesses. However, Pantheon goes a step above and they serve a high quality menu, especially the beautiful seafood (my favourite is of course the grilled calamari), but also very good lamb chops/leg. Their service is prompt and efficient; they make sure you are taken care of and always give you a complimentary Greek cake for the table on the house - have some coffees after your meal and unwind. Make a reservation as it might get busy especially in summertime if you want a seat inside for a larger party."

We ordered the grilled calamari dinner, a large skewer and Saganaki. All of which was great. The portions were generous and we were pleasantly surprised. They gave us honey cake on the house as well which was a nice end to the meal. The sweetness level was exactly as you would hope it to be"

The Hole In the Wall,Pubs,"2867 Dundas Street W Toronto, ON M6P 1Y9 Canada",ON,43.6652736,-79.4651984,4,"We had a really great experience there. No reservations for small parties and walk ins only. We didn’t wait too long before seated at the bar. Overall, we were happy with meal, drinks and ambiance, but they were far from 5 star rating. Here is my break down on the food we tried: calamari was a bit saggy but flavorful. Toad in the hole was probably the best, fresh sausage and pudding batter. Sheppard’s pie was so-so, if you like strong lamb flavor you’d probably like the pie, to me it lacked proper seasoning and spices. Panna cotta was standard, Negroni was very aromatic with complex profile( loved it). The menus were awful, degraded and mostly torn pieces ( I get the hip vibe but still menus should be reprinted) . Serve staff were not auper friendly, rushed , and a bit aggressive in taking orders. Some diversity training for them would be beneficial."
The Hole In the Wall,Pubs,"2867 Dundas Street W Toronto, ON M6P 1Y9 Canada",ON,43.6652736,-79.4651984,5,"Absolutely gorgeous and fantastic vibes in this place!

I didn't know what to expect but it still trumped my expectations.

Highly recommended for anyone looking for arguably the best pub atmosphere, food and drinks.

Below you can see two cocktails and their regular pepperoni pizza.

The Hole In the Wall,Pubs,"2867 Dundas Street W Toronto, ON M6P 1Y9 Canada",ON,43.6652736,-79.4651984,5,"This was my second time visiting this location after having just a few cocktails the first time, my boyfriend and I went back a second time for dinner and more drinks. I'm very happy we did!

Here are the Five S's for anyone wanting to visit this excellent restaurant in future (for dinner or just for drinks):

Space: A very unique space with a ""seat yourself"" policy, meaning you can find the perfect little snug hideaway at the back, or choose to sit at the bar or the high-top tables with a great view of the unique and appealing interior. A very eclectic mix of random memorabilia, antiques, whisky bottles and a very charming bar with an excellent selection of spirits

Seasoning/spice: We started with two martinis which were very well made, then went on to have the ""Chinatown"" calamari which was delicious and well-seasoned. The main courses were a Toad In The Hole which consisted of a huge, home-made Yorkshire pudding, a delicious Cumberland Sausage which was actually a traditionally made British sausage which was surprising and delicious. I had a Lamb Shepherd's Pie which was delicious, with a light and fluffy mashed potato, seasoned well with a very tasty, meat filled Lamb part. Fantastic. We finished with more cocktails and aged Whisky (they have an amazing selection of Whisky).

Size: Delicious food and the right size. Not too big and not too small.

Spend: The prices are worth it for the quality of the food. You won't be disappointed. Typically main courses are around $20-25 but again the quality of ingredients means it's totally worth it.

Service: Very good service, attentive staff who are knowledgeable about the drinks and the dishes."
The Hole In the Wall,Pubs,"2867 Dundas Street W Toronto, ON M6P 1Y9 Canada",ON,43.6652736,-79.4651984,5,"This is my favourite bar in the Junction area.  The place is small and seemingly crowded but very cosy and lively. I feel that sitting so close with other people adds to the intimate atmosphere.
The food is fantastic, the craft beer selection is great and the Dollar-ish Oyster Tuesdays are a hit as always."
The Hole In the Wall,Pubs,"2867 Dundas Street W Toronto, ON M6P 1Y9 Canada",ON,43.6652736,-79.4651984,5,"This is such a new discovery for me in the Junction/ Dundas area. The place is easy to be missed, but you have to check them out and try their amazing pizzas, their Fish & Chips plus their beers and cider (the grape open is amazing) on tap.

System of booking is weird. While most of the places use OpenTable , they ask you to message in instagram, what about the people who does not have it , you also can call, but no one pick up the phone. You cannot make a reservation the same day. So if you woke up on Sunday and decided to book a table, do not even try, you should know in advance that you want to have a branch at this place. We have been waiting 20 min, while 3 tables were hold and no one eat there."

There was a few groups waiting for the tables, but we opted to sit at the bar which didn’t require any wait.  The service was average for what you would expect.  One thing to note is that it gets a little noisy at the bar due to the staff crushing ice.  If you care to talk to your friends you may want to avoid the bar.  As for the food, everything came out as expected.  We really enjoyed the Smoked Salmon Benedict and the Brunch Poutine was pretty tasty.  It was a good experience and we were already talking about going back to try other things on the menu."

The portion can be much larger than this. At least, It was not sufficient for me. I suggest reservations as it may become super crowded.
I would recommend the place if you are not that hungry or they balance the portion/price. For instance, for two Sunnyside up eggs, a few fried potatoes, a slice of toast bread and, a few selected fruits, and a few bacon strips (good morning plate) was $18. It had a good variety of freshly made stuff but just a sample of each."

TACOS 11.50
3 house-made hardshell tacos with your choice of steak, pork, chorizo, veg or vegan. Finished with their house hot sauce, jalapeno-lime crema, mashed avocado, refried beans, fresh salsa,
and shredded cheddar. The Tacos are great. The hard shell is crunchy and flavorful.
A definite recommend.

CORN CHIPS with cheese. 7.95 + 2.00
House made tortilla chips served with mashed avocado, tomato-cilantro salsa, house hot sauce and crema.
The corn chips were amazing in the Tacos that I had to get them separately. Though the shredded cheese was a tad expensive given the amount that was on it. The avocado was ok. The salsa was ok. The hot sauce was good.
Would recommend but skip the cheese.

COMPLETO POUTINE 10.95 + $4 for the chorizo.
Hand cut fries, refried beans, and aged cheddar, topped with house made salsa. Served with mashed avocado and their hot sauce and crema.
This was ok. Their chorizo was more like a meat patty.  Not that it wasn't good, but the overall was so so.
Would pass next time.

This is a little hole in the wall take-away spot. Not an actual restaurant, as we learned. I really thought it would be as amazing as their other location.

The food was just as good, although the menu is much smaller, but it loses a lot of points for ambience and seating. You don't really have a choice but to sit outside on their tiny little patio sets. There is technically minimal indoor seating but the music is so loud, and the cooking too, that I can't imagine it would be great if you're looking to eat and chat with a friend. Eating outside on the sidewalk in chilly fall weather really killed the vibe for us. So, just be aware you'll have to bundle up now. It's either wasps or cold.

They have almost no selection of drinks, and no hot drinks. Not awesome when you're eating outside and it's autumn...

The staff was super friendly and helpful however.

As a takeout spot? 4.5 stars. As a dine-in (outside), it's only 3 as it's just okay. Nothing bad, but also not great. Still delicious food.

Also, if you're a woman (or man) looking for a husband, hang out here for a while ;) In the whole time we sat here, it was ALL men coming in. Only one other woman with her boyfriend. Good luck, single ladies!"
Completo,Latin American,"337 Broadview Ave Toronto, ON M4M 2H1 Canada",ON,43.6647498,-79.3520836,5,"If you want the best-tasting sandwich in Toronto, come to Completo. The beer on tap is barely cold and does not taste good but let me tell you, their sandwiches are the best! The Classic Churrasco sandwich will blow your socks off. Add a friend egg over easy and enjoy! Seriously, no other sandwich place in Toronto beats their Classic Churrasco sandwich IMHO.

The service was great. The Brazilian lady working there is friendly and courteous.

The outdoor patio furniture is very basic though. They should invest in nicer outdoor patio furniture. And please, get better-tasting beer on tap. Oh yeah, and make it colder. You serve barely cold beer. On a hot summer day, I want to enjoy a pint of ice cold beer, not barely cold beer. Ask the Brazilian lady working there how cold the beer they serve in Brazil is. It's ice cold, the way it should be, not barely cold like most places in Toronto serve it. Anyway, my rant is over. Go to Completo and enjoy the best sandwich ever!"
Completo,Latin American,"337 Broadview Ave Toronto, ON M4M 2H1 Canada",ON,43.6647498,-79.3520836,5,"Trying this location for the first time on a Tuesday evening at around 8:45PM. I've been to the other location in Leslieville and this place also did not disappoint. I ordered the box and the tacos which came to be about $30 tax included. Food was made fresh to order and came in good portions. Although it's quite greasy in general, it's still bomb.

Would recommend and come back."
Completo,Latin American,"337 Broadview Ave Toronto, ON M4M 2H1 Canada",ON,43.6647498,-79.3520836,5,The food here tastes great! Their steak classic churrasco tasted amazing and the fries were well seasoned. Their oak latte was also just sweet enough but not too sweet to actually drown out the drink. I had already made up my mind on what I was planning to order because I looked up the menu online but there are also some daily specials that I might try and grab another time.
Completo,Latin American,"337 Broadview Ave Toronto, ON M4M 2H1 Canada",ON,43.6647498,-79.3520836,5,"One of the best Latin restaurants in the city! Usually not a big fan of hard shell tacos but they just do it right. Stuffed with huge chunks of meat, other fillings and hot sauce. Good selection of desserts - Bolas were so fluffy and sweet. My friends also swore by their flan and sandwiches! It is located only minutes away from Riverdale by foot so it makes a great picnic food too 😊"
Completo,Latin American,"337 Broadview Ave Toronto, ON M4M 2H1 Canada",ON,43.6647498,-79.3520836,5,"😇🤤🤤🤤🥰

These are
: the Classic Churrasco sandwich (looks messy from the inside, but it's filled to the brim)
: & goat fries

TIP for spice 🔥 level
: There are 2 spice levels to choose from for the sandwich, medium & spicy. I chose the latter. If you think you can tolerate the heat, go for it. It complements everything 🤤"
Queen of Persia,Persian/Iranian,"672A St Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M6C 1B1 Canada",ON,43.6820007,-79.4254216,4,"The food here might be up to taste (my bf loved his lamb dish, I can only finish half of my zucchini). But this place no doubt has one of the best atmosphere among restaurants I've been too. The furniture, decoration, art pieces, utensils and music all came together so nicely for not just a delightful meal, but a delightful experience."
Queen of Persia,Persian/Iranian,"672A St Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M6C 1B1 Canada",ON,43.6820007,-79.4254216,5,"Been to this place many times, for various occasions.

The food is great - whether it’s for dinner, lunch or as of recently brunch. Great presentation, very similar to more high end Iranian restaurants in Iran. Variety of options on the menu from kebabs to stews to small platters for share.

Very happy with their recent brunch addition to the menu. Delicious and reasonably price. Checkout the videos and photos from last year and this year."
Queen of Persia,Persian/Iranian,"672A St Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M6C 1B1 Canada",ON,43.6820007,-79.4254216,5,"Initially, we were seated quite close to another table. However, one of them offered to rearrange some furniture and move our table further apart from the table next to us, which I really appreciated. The service was quite relaxed (or because they were busy, we had to flag someone down a couple of times), and so, we didn't feel rushed until they had another reservation a couple hours later.

Generous portion sizes for the price and great balance of flavours - I could easily share or have enough left over for another meal. The lamb skewer was tender and moist, while the lamb stew had a good amount of bite-sized lamb and aromatic and flavourful rice. While I would order a skewer or stew dish again, the dessert pastry roll seemed smaller than expected, compared to the mains, and could've had more pistachio taste."
Queen of Persia,Persian/Iranian,"672A St Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M6C 1B1 Canada",ON,43.6820007,-79.4254216,5,"What a gem! I went late on a rainy Sunday night and it was full and vibrant. The waitress was very kind and helpful with the menu. I had a delicious dish of stewed chicken with rice and a bright salad of greens, pomegranate, ground walnuts and white cheese. The flavours were tangy and complex and really don’t need as much salt as chef is using. Definitely will return with friends to sample more items. A welcoming oasis on an otherwise dull stretch of St Clair."

Had better baklava but all the rest was spot on."

Whether it was to celebrate birthdays, celebrate Easter or just to have a dinner with the family. The food has always been delicious. Sometimes the tabouli is missing some lemon, but overall it’s good. The falafel here is probably my favourite and the fried eggplant. The dinner for two is such a good deal and there’s a lot of food. You definitely get your moneys worth. Sometimes service is a bit a slow, but overall the servers are very nice."

Had yummy eggplant,  hummus, baba ganoush.  The chicken and lamb skewers were good as well.  The dinner for two could really be a dinner for 2 and a child.
Good service.  Good atmosphere.

The menu you see now has actually increased in price.   The dinner for two was $50 now its $54.  A glass of wine was $14
Total all in with tax and 15% tips was about $80.   A bit pricey.   But gotta try it at least once."

The meat was very good, although underseasoned. I believe the intention was that the diner is supposed to add salt and pepper to their taste, so I don't really mind it. The fries and rice were not bad, the tahini was very good, the bread was also very good.
The service was good enough. I wasn't pampered, I also wasn't ignored.
The decor is pretty nice, floors were clean, table wasn't sticky, and oddly enough the dining area had no smell at all which for the most part is a good thing, although I wondered why the restaurant didnt even smell of the food they make.
I would come back again to try the other dishes."

Khau Gully,Indian,"1991 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4S 1Z8 Canada",ON,43.7005696,-79.3968091,5,"This is my favourite Indian restaurant in Toronto. The staff are friendly, food is delicious, and the menu is robust so you’ll never be bored as there are always news things to try!

I’ve done both dine in and take out- both are great.

What I’ve tried that I’ve loved:
- Bhindi Rajsthani - deep fried okra side dish- I’ve never had anything like it. This dish was recommended by the owner and was so crispy and delicious.

- Stuffed spinach paneer - so unique and flavourful

- Briyani - very unique in its presentation with a piece of pita on top of it

- Lasooni Dhaniya"
Khau Gully,Indian,"1991 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4S 1Z8 Canada",ON,43.7005696,-79.3968091,5,"Great Indian restaurant. Food is quite good and can be adjusted to your spice tolerance. The servers are very nice and informative. Walked us through the entire menu and had good recommendations. We ordered the Stuffed Mushrooms, Lamb Chops Burra, Lamb Rogan Josh, Dal Makhni, Chicken Dum Biryani, and Pudina Paranthas. Lamb chops Burra, Dal Makhni, and Chicken Biryani were really good. Lamb Rogan Josh was their own version and was decent. Worth a visit if you like Indian food."

Loved the food and tase is really very mesmerizing. It reminded me of the food taste from back home.Loved the food and the servers were also very nice. We tried the vegetarian appetizer platter & fried okras which were really tasty.

We also loved the Kofta Sham Savere and Lasuni Dhaniya Paneer in the main course. Both of these sabjis were up to the mark.A gem of a eatery hidden in Eglinton and Yonge!! Food is delicious, just perfect. They accommodate customers wish as per their choice. We went for our friends Birthday and they gave us the best service as well as served awesome food!! Thank you Khau Gully as we had a memorable and tasty experience.

Highly Recommended!!!"

Two of us came and we spent around $60 for 2 main courses and 1 appetizer and even that, we never finish our food so we can take out and eat that for tomorrow lunch. That’s how big the portion is."

We also had the equally yummy Malay Curry. The flavors of the two dishes were so similar that after a while we couldn't tell them apart. The Holy Basil Beef was nice only absent a distinct a Basil scent or flavor. Would not recommend. The amount of rice with that dish was shocking, although beautifully presented. The place was empty except for some takeaway pickups; it was midweek so not too surprising. Our server was delightful and even recommended another Thai restaurant in the area we should try."

We ordered cashew nut chicken and beef massaman curry for the main dish and both were great. The chicken and beef were not chewy at all.

For the appetizer we had cripsy fried tofu. Portion was huge, its firm tofu nice and crispy but flavour wise, quite bland. The peanut sauce is bland and too chunky. But still a good shareable.

We also had coconut rice for the sides. My girlfriend was shook (lol) when she first saw the coconut rice were served with rainbow sprinkles on top. The texture was rice pudding like, too mushy, and tasted a little too sweet not umami.

Overall with a great service provided and for the price we paid, it was a pleasant evening spent."

There were a few things I did not enjoy. But first, the restaurant itself was clean and bright. The tables small and enough for 2 people and two bowls of noodles. The service was good and i liked their bubble tea.
I ordered the pickled vegetable beef noodle soup. The beef was so overcooked it was all crumbling in my soup and there wasnt a lot. The noodle portion sizes were crazy big. CRAZY BIG. There were so many noodles in there it felt like the more I ate, the more noodles there were. The flavour was alright.
It was definitely something that can be shared among two people or they could even have a size small."

Ordered through Doordash before once and enjoyed the beef noodles. This time tried the Braised Beef Noodles and it was delicious!! Reheated the broth but that was due to my dasher not putting in a heating bag. 9.2/10

I also ordered the bean noodle which I thought was jellyfish at first. Really delicious appetizer! I think it was topped with chili oil.

Restaurant is relatively small but humble and I really enjoyed my meal! Fair price point for flavor and quantity. Definitely appreciated that!"

Stopped by for a midnight snack and got a small jerk chicken and a small jerk pork to share. With oxtail gravy, of course and goes without saying, rice and peas. Also got a salt fish fritter. Everything was. Just. so. Amazingly. Good. You just have to walk by the place and smell the smoke coming off the grill to know what the food tastes like.
Ate in the car cause we couldn't wait. Inhaled it. Then I started getting mad thinking about the times I wasted money getting Jamaican food from places that are subpar.
I'm already thinking about when we can go back.."

They have jerk chicken, jerk pork, rice and peas, coleslaw, fried fish (snapper or saltfish) topped with onions and carrots, soup, dumplings, festivals, and more. But most importantly they have sauce and not afraid to give it! Overall the food is very flavorful. Their customer service is great and that's what you want from a business, so you can keep coming back!!The line was long before opening but after that it was moving. Hope this small business will always stay, despite all the construction."

One table was there to cut up the meat and the grill with pork was on the other side. CASH only at this restaurant.  If you don't have there's an ATM inside, the fee is $2.50.
They have a variety of items on the menu, there's no menu by the way. Just ask...there was fried chicken on the left and dumplings, festival, fried plantain  escovitch fish on the other side.  They have oxtail the night we visited.  You can order the small for $9, with or without rice; #2 meat only or #3 large meat and rice and peas.  Ask for gravy on the rice and get BBQ sauce on your meat.  You got to go outside once you ordered for the BBQ items.  It is worth the drive to Oakwood and Eglinton and worth the wait."

I had the Strawberry Johnny Pancakes (very good, very filling) but got a look at their Benny and it looked hearty as well.

Our server was very pleasant - attentive without being overbearing - and all the clientele seemed to be families or dating couples... so if you're looking for a good brunch date place consider this one. Meat and vegetarian options available."

Hana Don,Japanese,"128 Dundas Street W Toronto, ON M5G 1C3 Canada",ON,43.655732,-79.3845763,5,"This is the third location of Hana Don and the first location downtown. It specializes more on premium seafood donburi so expect more on the menu if sashimi is more what you like.

It also has donburis that are found at the other locations though like chicken katsu or sous vide beef.

All the donburis are very colorful and plated nicely. A donburi can definitely fill you up but if you can eat a lot, might be better to order an appetizer too. The price ranges from $19 to $30 for a donburi depending on what you order. The most expensive one is the lobster donburi which can be upwards to $70 a donburi.

Food comes out relatively quickly but always check their Instagram for any specials that might be going on."

Our reservation was at 10 AM and were the very first customer of the day. We ordered the omelette special of the day and the sausage biscuit. The former was delicious while the latter was decent. The frites were well done. We were a tad disappointed with the coffee refills. We were not informed that the refills were an additional.charge.

The Queen And Beaver Public House,Pubs,"35 Elm Street Toronto, ON M5G 1H1 Canada",ON,43.6573389,-79.3833118,5,Nice spot close to the Eaton Centre to grab a drink or two. Cozy interior that reminds me of European pubs and they pour a lovely pint of Guinness here too. Didn’t try the food but the menu looks interesting. There are 2 floors as well as an upper patio. Friendly service by the bartender and front of house staff. Would recommend!
The Queen And Beaver Public House,Pubs,"35 Elm Street Toronto, ON M5G 1H1 Canada",ON,43.6573389,-79.3833118,3,"I came here for the first time as a friend who had a good experience.

The bar's atmosphere was great, the decoration was also very English, and the overall style was well-established. But it is a pity that their food taste was relatively average, the portion was small, and the price was a bit too high.

There were six people in our group, and we ordered fish and chips, seafood pie and curry rice.
For the fish and chips, friends like it, and some don't because their fish is crispy on the top but soggy on the bottom. If you like crispy skin, their fish and chips might be for someone else.
I ordered the seafood pie, but it didn't surprise me. That pie was almost all mashed potatoes and little seafood in it. And it was about $30, so I didn't feel delighted.

The service was okay because it was jam-packed on weekends, and the server rarely checked on us. He talked fast and felt rushed all the time.

Overall, the food could have been more satisfying, the price was too high, and the service was average."
The Queen And Beaver Public House,Pubs,"35 Elm Street Toronto, ON M5G 1H1 Canada",ON,43.6573389,-79.3833118,5,"Cute British pub with hearty delicious food. We sat on the 2nd floor which has a more casual vibe with couches, TVs and bar. Service was excellent. Drink selection had some classic UK pints. Food was British pub style with great flavours. We had the squash-chickpea-curry  pie which had a lot of great spices and flavours with a nice tangy garnish. My friend had the cod fish and chips which were perfectly cooked inside and out.

Update - came back in spring and it's still excellent! Try the pies, not too heavy and just right 👌"

Pearl Diver,Seafood,"100 Adelaide Street E Toronto, ON M5C 1K9 Canada",ON,43.6515769,-79.3737766,5,"Amazing seafood restaurant with great daily deals. My friends and I came for the $100 for 100 oysters deal, which is definitely a DEAL! Nowadays in Toronto, a lot of buck a shuck places have become $2 a shuck places, so it's rare to find such a high quality oyster deal. The oysters are fresh, a good size, and beautifully plated. The 100 came out staggered in 3 plates, which were delivered over the span of an hour or so. It did seem like they could bring them out at the pace that you requested, we asked for a staggered delivery because one of our friends was running late. We had three people sharing the oysters and it was a bit much - four people would have been ideal.

We also tried the PD Fries and Icelandic Cod, both of which were good. Next time we'll probably bring more people to split the 100 oysters and try a few more of the apps. Definitely make a reservation if you're coming on a Thursday, since that's the day of the deal."
Pearl Diver,Seafood,"100 Adelaide Street E Toronto, ON M5C 1K9 Canada",ON,43.6515769,-79.3737766,5,"If you’re a lover of seafood, Pearl Diver is absolute must. I’m glad I made reservations for this place, because even early on a weekday night, it was completely packed —  and for good reason! Great atmosphere, cheerful service, and above all else, some really incredible dishes. We ordered the sesame fried calamari, PD fish & chips and the atlantic lobster. The calamari might be my new favourite out of anywhere else I’ve tried! The fish and chips were perfectly fried with a delicious, flaky texture on the haddock. The lobster was also quite large, packed with meat and very flavourful! So glad we tried this place on recommendation of a local friend. I know we’ll definitely be back again on our next visit to Toronto."

Pearl Diver,Seafood,"100 Adelaide Street E Toronto, ON M5C 1K9 Canada",ON,43.6515769,-79.3737766,4,Another delicious and classic seafood meal. We went for dinner on a Saturday evening and it really hits the spot. The chowder was hearty and thick. The lobster sliders are made with chunky lobster chunks and flavourful. The fish and chips were crispy and better than your average pub type. The oysters were a hit. A great place for a casual seafood dinner.
Pearl Diver,Seafood,"100 Adelaide Street E Toronto, ON M5C 1K9 Canada",ON,43.6515769,-79.3737766,4,"Cozy!  That is how I would describe this quaint and an charming nook right off the busy streets of Adelaide.  A quirky bar celebrating all that is seafood.  the decor and the ambience of this venue is memorable...featuring anchors, ropes, iridescent shells and fishnets and with the walls and posts coated with blackboard paint features of the daily specials. And the pace is allows you take a pause and breathe, but that does not the service gets shortchanged. All of the servers are prompt and with adequate knowledge of the menu and faster on their feet in bringing the food over.

For seafood lovers, look no further as Pearl diver features a wide array of freshly shucked oysters all across the nation and a wider array of malted beverages to wash them down. I had the oysters from PEI with the mignoette sauces alongside hot mustard and they were divine! I had a thre grilled Sea bream and my friend dined on the  Fish and chips....I wasn't particularly attached to my Sea bream but that is no bearing on the chef! Sea bream is encased with bones but which fish isn't! My friend's entree had me salivating for more!

Overall, would definitely make another trip!"

The photos on Instagram looked great!!! We get there and the smell drew is right in!!! We got the classic chicken and flank steak sandwiches and the tater tots supreme.

Rustic ideas but modern spins on it and it really brought out the right impacts. Messy goodness and you love every bite of it! Definitely going back!!!"
Knuckle Sandwich,Poutineries,"969 Coxwell Avenue Toronto, ON M4C 3G4 Canada",ON,43.6962462,-79.3285751,1,"For someone that isn't Muslim this is a good non halal option. I ordered the classic chicken sandwich and I didn't pay much attention to the actual description which I should have. When I think classic chicken sandwich I think fried chicken with mayonnaise. The chicken was cooked well however it was way too sweet for my liking and had no mayonnaise on the sandwich whatsoever. Personally I don't see the connection between classic chicken sandwich and this sandwich. I'd like to know what other people think. I wouldn't recommend this sandwich as a classic sandwich. I could only eat half, way to sweet for me. Also the bun was supper soggy and I only live five min away. As a suggestion I'd recommend putting a traditional chicken sandwich on the menu that is savory and not sweet. For $16.89 I also think the product doesn't reflect the price. Definitely over priced as well. I tried eating the other half but had to throw it out. It's like eating a spoon of honey. What a shame. I'd be interested to know if anyone else has other recommendations on where I can get some good fried chicken (non halal) thanks."
Knuckle Sandwich,Poutineries,"969 Coxwell Avenue Toronto, ON M4C 3G4 Canada",ON,43.6962462,-79.3285751,3,It's OK. Heard alot of buzz about this place and their big sandwiches. Went in for a takeway snadwich and ordered the fried chicken sandwich. It took alot of time to make which I was fine. When I went to pay and tip it came to about 20 bucks which when I opened the food doesn't seem worth it. The sandwich was ok but I wouldn't be going back anytime soon.
Knuckle Sandwich,Poutineries,"969 Coxwell Avenue Toronto, ON M4C 3G4 Canada",ON,43.6962462,-79.3285751,5,"I'm what you would call ""serious"" about my eating choices and I love the food there. It is wholesome! If you want to get something that's ""not-so-great"" you can choose that option.
If you want to have something that is ""clean"", there's that option too.
You won't get the ""Ugh, why did I eat that"" feel. It's worth the money and it's fresh. My first time there was great and I would definitely go again.

If you're in the area, give them a try, it's worth it."
Knuckle Sandwich,Poutineries,"969 Coxwell Avenue Toronto, ON M4C 3G4 Canada",ON,43.6962462,-79.3285751,1,"Way too expensive for what you get. $30 with tax for a chicken sandwich and brussel sprout salad, no drink included.

The food is alright. Honestly as far as fried chicken sandwiches go, there is a lot of competition in this area putting out a better product for less. The Cuban was good, but again why is it $15+tax? For just a sandwich? I will echo another review here and say this is ""beyond inflation."" I went during peak times and the place was empty.. it has potential, I want to like this place.

I went here twice, really wanted to find a reliable sandwich shop in the Village. The atmosphere is actually nice, beers in the fridge, could be way more popular if prices were lower.

Sadly I won't be returning a third time. Too expensive for a quick lunch, not as substantial as a dinner elsewhere at the same price.

To the owners if you read this: I suggest either increasing the quality of your chicken, including a soft drink if you're going to charge $11 for a side, or overall just lowering your prices even a dollar or two. I would go once a week if I could get a Cuban sandwich, small fry and can of coke for $18, or $25 with a beer."

The servers were super nice and attentive. We had the assorted meat platter momos which were delicious with the sauces they teach you to mix. The chili chicken was also super flavourful and the meal came with soup and a ginger cardamom tea.

Prices were very good and they had lots of seating inside and out (we enjoyed a nice sunny evening on the patio). Highly recommend!"

Since coming here the first time this place has become a destination for us, and we try to make a point of getting here at least once a year. Because of the pandemic and resulting border closure, we hadn't been in over two years. We were finally able to make it up yesterday and it's still as good as ever. Food, service, vibe all on point. Coming here absolutely made our day in Toronto a 10/10. Thank you guys. BTW, I recommend the Ting-Ma buns, dipped in the momo sauces they give with a bit of soy sauce."

The service was great! Very attentive, also they serve water with chilled glasses.

Tried several different momo from shrimp, vegetarian and chicken (butter chicken)

The sauces they provide definitely added to the flavour of momos. The butter chicken momo was our favourite. Our least favourite was probably the shrimp.

They provide complimentary tea and that was delicious!"

The service was efficient. There is a QR code for the menu, which is not my favourite but cost effective - this can help keep the food prices reasonable.

The atmosphere was fun and casual."

Here, we ordered the Tacos de Birria con Queso (comes with four tacos, grilled together with cheese, topped with slow cooked beef marinated in Mexican chiles salsa, with a side of birria consommé, cilantro, onions, limes, and salsa). Super delicious!

We also got some Tacos Baja Style, specifically the Pescado (deep fried battered fish, served in a blue corn tortilla). This was definitely good, but maybe not what I would try again here. I would opt for the birria or new dishes."

Borrel,Modern European,"1333 Danforth Avenue Toronto, ON M4J 1N1 Canada",ON,43.6819544,-79.3290184,5,"Cozy space with great vibes. Finally came to try the food after being curious about the space for awhile. We had a great time! The tables are close together but we got to have a nice chat with our table neighbour and share recommendations on the menu.

We ended up ordering 2 appetisers and 3 mains - the Indonesian fried rice dish was our favourite! Super fragrant and was the perfect combo of salty, sweet and spicy. Definitely get this with the satay chicken skewers (that house made satay sauce - yum!). We can’t wait to come again to try the rest of the menu! Service was great and food came promptly! We spent less than $100 on the food for 2, and were stuffed!

Highly recommend this local gem! Thank you to the team that served us and fed us!!"
Borrel,Modern European,"1333 Danforth Avenue Toronto, ON M4J 1N1 Canada",ON,43.6819544,-79.3290184,4,"Cozy, warm atmosphere, friendly staff, and good service. It was my first time trying Dutch cuisine, and I liked it. We had bitterballen, snert, frikandellen, boerenenkool, and poffertjes. The food was tasty, full of flavor, and well-presented.

Four stars due to reasonable criticism: first, portions are tiny, and I didn't feel satisfied with the dish; and second, the problem is that the menu is limited; there should be a broader spectrum of Dutch dishes, for example, notorious Pannenkoek was not on the menu; for desserts, there is only one option.

Overall it was a great experience, and I would come back again and recommend it as an introduction to Dutch cuisine."
Borrel,Modern European,"1333 Danforth Avenue Toronto, ON M4J 1N1 Canada",ON,43.6819544,-79.3290184,3,"I came here once for genever, once for rijsttafel, and finally here just for dinner.

I really wish it was better. The flavours just don't cut it for Indonesian food. We had a lot of indo food in Amsterdam, including rijsttafel a bunch of times at various places. This was as good as the worst place we tried there. I do recall (pre-COVID) the rijsttafel here being disappointing but this city is incredibly limited for this food so I was just grateful to have it at all.

This time... as nice as the staff are, they can't make up for the poorly flavoured food. The satays were edible, but not good. Tasteless. Just some overcooked chicken skewers. The nasi goreng was bitter and bland, and the plate was just ugly and brown. Not even a cucumber for colour. And where was the egg?!

The bitterballen were actually perfect. I don't know why I ordered them though because I didn't really get the hype about them in Netherlands, so I don't know why I thought that would change. I'll say Borrel's are almost identical to the ones we had in The Hague. So, they do succeed there. Very authentic.

The fries were just terrible. They tasted and felt like they had been fried, cooled, and refried about 10 times and then sat out all night under the headlamp. Rock hard and full of grease. And didn't even taste good. We had loads of Dutch fries in our visits and to say these are anything like the ones there is not even reasonable. I don't really know what to make of it if they can't make good fries...

It's hard to find good Indo/Malay food in Toronto, so I appreciate Borrel trying by doing not only the white Dutch food but also the Netherlands great Indonesian cuisine culture. I just think there are other restaurants in Toronto that do Indo flavours so much better.

Also, if you haven't had genever... do it when you're here. It is almost impossible to find in Ontario, and it's not available in any LCBO or any other Toronto bar as far as I know. I have to give kudos to Borrel for going through all the trouble of bringing this spirit to us.

I think it seems like the Dutch food is generally well-done, so if I ever do return, I'll just stick to that (and genever!) and go elsewhere for Indonesian food."
Borrel,Modern European,"1333 Danforth Avenue Toronto, ON M4J 1N1 Canada",ON,43.6819544,-79.3290184,4,"This was my first time trying Dutch food and it was quite good. Came here on a Saturday morning for brunch with a friend. Menu is simple and not too much items. It was good that we were also able to order from their snack menu too. Bitterballen was a surprise for me and it was delicious. Frittata was good and even better with the sausage. My friend also enjoyed her frikmuffin but was surprised with how tiny her portion sandwich was. Service was great and staff was attentive. Overall, it's a great place to introduce yourself to Dutch food. Delicious and my friend says is authentic. I just wished they opened for lunch during weekdays too."

I was so wrong. The menu is a fun, easy introduction to many dishes I've never heard of before. We tried the Genever ( traditional Dutch spirit similar to Gin). We ordered two dishes from the Indonesian part of the menu as well. Mmmmmmmm. Peanut sauce."

And it was a great experience. So much attention from our waiter, he was professional and knowledgeable. The food exceeded our expectations, and let me tell you. The filet mignon is one of the best in Toronto. Only Don Alfonso can compete. The cut was extremely tender, cooked to perfection (as ordered, rare), chicken was very tender too. The coconut cream pie is delicious! And the chocolate cake was so good as well, had many textures and elements in it. The atmosphere is so cozy and high end, it felt like a restaurant in Paris. They have a wonderful view from the balcony, if you are lucky enough, they let you go and enjoy it for some time. The only downside was that it was our anniversary and  my partner mentioned it in the reservation notes, but no one acknowledged it. A simple “happy anniversary!” would do :). But that’s my only complain. Beautiful, wonderful dining experience. Definitely recommend ♥️"

With Scaramouche, it's not just the food that's great, the ambience too is absolutely wonderful. The waiters are kind, we get our corner to ourselves, and we enjoyed our meal in peace.

The chefs are very talented and they ask you how the rice portion is and if you would like to up the wasabi level. Was well worth it! A very memorable dining experience.
Yasu,Japanese,"81 Harbord Street Toronto, ON M5S 1G4 Canada",ON,43.6627374,-79.4031961,5,"Best dining experience in Toronto. Everything is so beautifully and meticulously prepared. It’s the perfect amount of food to not make you too full.
The overall experience and food we enjoyed more than Alo.
Only wish they had some cocktails on the menu."
Pizza Banfi,Italian,"333 Lonsdale Rd Toronto, ON M5P 1R3 Canada",ON,43.6884375,-79.4131124,5,"First time to try Pizza Banfi last night with a party of 7 people. It was highly recommended by friends who have been visited there for over a decade. The inside was not so big but definitely a great ambience and cozy atmosphere. High quality dishes & each of them was carefully crafted. Lovely presentation and they all tasted delicious. We loved the Pizza Prosciutto E Funghi and their thin crust was fantastic. We also ordered the fish of the day ~ red snapper and mussels, their seafood were fresh and seasoned well. Their ravioli and spaghetti were a MUST try on menu. They did show warm hospitality. The Owner was super friendly. Staff were all polite and attentive. They came several times to check on us to make sure everything was good. That made it an authentic Italian restaurant. We enjoyed our meals and what a wonderful dining experience at Pizza Banfi. Please make a reservation in advance to avoid missing the opportunity having good decent Italian food. Will definitely recommend to friends and family who love Italian cuisine."
Pizza Banfi,Italian,"333 Lonsdale Rd Toronto, ON M5P 1R3 Canada",ON,43.6884375,-79.4131124,5,"Visited Pizza Banfi recently. Atmosphere was very cozy, and warm. Staff was really friendly and knowledgeable. Had the Vegetarian pizza - honestly probably one of the best pizzas I’ve had in Toronto, absolutely delicious. The dessert was also really good. Price is reasonable ($$-$$$)"
Pizza Banfi,Italian,"333 Lonsdale Rd Toronto, ON M5P 1R3 Canada",ON,43.6884375,-79.4131124,5,"My wife and I have been going to the place since 1998. And we have never been disappointed.

Nestled in Forest Hill Village, Banfi is one of my favorite pizza and pasta places. It’s a small, cozy place. You almost feel like you’re walking into someone’s living room.

Each and every visit , the owner has greeted us with a great and welcoming smile. They consistently serve great pasta and pizza, and the specials vary.

Best compliment I can pay to this place. In over 20 years of dining at this place, service, quality of food and overall experience has never disappointed.

And in my humble opinion, they serve the best Tiramisu in the city next two Terroni and Stock TC"
Pizza Banfi,Italian,"333 Lonsdale Rd Toronto, ON M5P 1R3 Canada",ON,43.6884375,-79.4131124,5,"My daughter and her husband booked their wedding reception here for 35 people.  While the restaurant is small, we all fit beautifully - and in very comfortable chairs I might add.

The food was traditionally Italian and of a super high quality, and beautifully laid out:  plates of bruschetta for starters and then several platters of seafood and antipasti were brought to each of the 7 group tables.

For the pasta course: cannelloni, which my brother said was among the best he had ever eaten.  I am severely gluten intolerant so they customized a penne plate for me with lots of veggies - delicious.

Then came a choice of Osso Bucco or salmon, or a vegetarian plate.  I chose the salmon which was a HUGE and perfect portion with lovely mango and baby tomato bits as a sauce.  It was perfectly seared, served alongside baby carrots and grilled asparagus.  Bottled flat and sparkling water was served, alongside choices of wine.

For dessert we had a customized gluten free wedding cake delivered, and they placed it on a dedicated table in the corner of the room near the light - beautiful.  Servers sliced and plated it at no extra charge.  Guests also ordered digestifs; our table had Amaretto with large orange slices - wow!

Everything was brilliant and service was impeccable - wine and water glasses were refilled and plates were cleared at a comfortable pace.  Staff was super professional and chatted with us in a friendly manner.

Few receptions are planned in small neighbourhood restaurants as people often turn to banquet halls or wedding-specific venues.  Several guests said this is what they would choose for their future weddings.

Thanks Banfi back-and-front-of-house staff - and owner!  My daughter was elated as everything went so well and the restaurant was beautifully set up with traditional thick crisp white linen tablecloths and huge linen napkins - so classy.

On each table was a glass with a large sprig of freesia in it - Banfi didn't know this, but that was the [memorial] flower of the day - and in my daughter's bridal bouquet as well."
Pizza Banfi,Italian,"333 Lonsdale Rd Toronto, ON M5P 1R3 Canada",ON,43.6884375,-79.4131124,5,"Absolutely stellar service, and amazing food. Will definitely be returning. Best dinner I've had out in a very very long time."
Daldongnae,Korean,"658 Bloor Street Toronto, ON M6G 1K9 Canada",ON,43.6642855,-79.4156824,4,"Pretty standard Korean fare, the quality of the meat was good, prepared food was tasty. Cozy interior with friendly service. Amazing that they are open late every night. Great place to cap off an evening out with friends or if you just want to grab a tasty meal. Minimum 2 orders of meat or vegan set per table!"
Daldongnae,Korean,"658 Bloor Street Toronto, ON M6G 1K9 Canada",ON,43.6642855,-79.4156824,4,The place was packed when we arrived but wait times were quick and we were seated within 10min.   Quick and attentive service by staff. High quality meats and vegetables paired with wonderful sides.   Atmosphere was clean and lively.  I would definitely recommend dining here again.
Daldongnae,Korean,"658 Bloor Street Toronto, ON M6G 1K9 Canada",ON,43.6642855,-79.4156824,5,"Took a friend who has never had Korean food before. This place was very convinient & clean to introduce Korean table top cooking, all the side dishes, kimchi & Korean soybean stew all at once.
They loved everything especially the quality of meats, soybean stew & kimchi. My Korean food introduction dinner was such a success.

Although it was hard to get attention from the server because they were way too busy and I heard if we go during the weekend it could be even worse.

They also have 1.5 hours limited seating time due to the restaurant being so popular. For me I need minimum 2 hours to sit down and have a few drinks, chat, order more meats.

If you have any friends who would like to experience Korean food for the first time, this place might be it!"
Daldongnae,Korean,"658 Bloor Street Toronto, ON M6G 1K9 Canada",ON,43.6642855,-79.4156824,5,"If you are looking for the best Korean barbecue in town, this is the place to be. It is not a very big place but it is one of the best. Pork and beef barbecue are delicious! All the complimentary sauces and side dishes are delicious. Of course order a pancake, it is a bit spicy but not really. The kimchi soup is moderate spicy as well and so so good. Comparing to the one I had in South Korea, i didn’t feel the difference. The staff is so friendly and helpful. There is a paid parking lot right behind the restaurent. Place is so busy all the time (evening time)."
Daldongnae,Korean,"658 Bloor Street Toronto, ON M6G 1K9 Canada",ON,43.6642855,-79.4156824,5,"Went there to have a soju and eat some good meat with my friends~

We got there RIGHT before the rush at 6pm, so I’d recommend to go around that time or you might have to wait.

Each meat comes in 200g worth, and I’d say that’s ABOUT one portion, but I also shared some seafood pancake and ate rice with it. So I’d say a minimum of $30 of food per person to get full.

This plays is famous for their infinite corn cheese, so take good advantage of that! You can always ask for more side dishes, and if you’re someone like me who likes kimchi at kbbq you can ask for extra :)

I feel like I should’ve drank another bottle of soju, I’ll do that next time LOL"
Seoul Food Take-Out,Korean,"606 Sherbourne Street Ground Level Toronto, ON M4X Canada",ON,43.6719658,-79.3768762,5,"A longtime favourite of mine for weekday lunches. Prices are extremely reasonable especially considering the quality and quantity you get. Their daily specials are all excellent - the spicy pork and bulgogi are my favourites. The fish katsu (only available on Thursdays) is also delicious and freshly fried to order. All hot foods come with side dishes (japchae, fried dumpling, spring roll, vegetables), which really round out the meal. Portions are big and I've never been able to finish it in one sitting. The owner is really nice as well and provides very quick service, so don't be intimidated by the lunch queue! Cash only."
Seoul Food Take-Out,Korean,"606 Sherbourne Street Ground Level Toronto, ON M4X Canada",ON,43.6719658,-79.3768762,5,"Wow!! I’ve always wanted to try this place and finally was able to today. I went with the veggie bibimbap as it was the daily special and added beef bulgogi. The flavour is out of this world! Rice, veggies, beef, japchae, a spring roll, a dumpling, a fried egg all came in my order. Serious bang for your buck and the lady who served me was so kind and quick. 100% will return."

Seoul Food Take-Out,Korean,"606 Sherbourne Street Ground Level Toronto, ON M4X Canada",ON,43.6719658,-79.3768762,5,I got the Chicken Curry and Spicy Pork. I like the spicy Pork very much Korean flavor.
Seoul Food Take-Out,Korean,"606 Sherbourne Street Ground Level Toronto, ON M4X Canada",ON,43.6719658,-79.3768762,5,My first time here getting take out and to be quite honest this place is probably one of the tastiest Korean places I’ve tried. I got the “bulgogi meal” that was packed with tons of food. The shop is ran by a kind and sweet lady that clearly puts all her love in her cooking! Will definitely come down here to have this place again!
Gyubee Japanese Grill - Bloor,Barbeque,"335 Bloor Street W Toronto, ON M5S 1W7 Canada",ON,43.6671472,-79.400645,4,"dinner menu during lunch time. tried almost everything. All of them are tasty. While all the beef and pork are good, other memorable ones are salmon, ajilo, bibimbap, pineapple.

Menu is not extensive but straightforward and covers all the things you might and might not expect, and none of them disappoints. It seems the current selection comes from years of experience, they left only most-demanded and truly popular delicious item. Very satisfying.
Comfy seating, quick attentive service"
Gyubee Japanese Grill - Bloor,Barbeque,"335 Bloor Street W Toronto, ON M5S 1W7 Canada",ON,43.6671472,-79.400645,4,"The Bloor location is my favourite in the Toronto area. The wait list isn't usually too long and the dining area is spacious and clean. The service is great as there are a good number number of servers, and they change your grill for you at a good frequency without you having to ask. The food here is always tasty as well. The meats are fresh and well seasoned, and I haven't had any complaints with the desserts or appetizers to date."

The restaurant and restroom are both clean. The staff is courteous and efficient. For a two-hour seating period, this is an all-you-can-eat restaurant. Fresh meat is provided. Dessert is also offered. The price is high, but the food is great. They also offer discount if you’re paying in cash. I highly recommended this restaurant."

I really recommend the pork belly and beef brisket. Their soda drinks are very good as well, the best we had are: ume, yuzu, and peach soda. It’s also nice they give you a melons by the end of the meal :)

It did not disappoint at all. The atmosphere, the food and our server TJ were nothing short of amazing! Highly recommend"
Sorrel,Mediterranean,"1158 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4W 2L9 Canada",ON,43.6802296,-79.3910738,5,My friend and I came here for her birthday and we had a great experience! Our server was incredibly nice and informative of their special menu. I had the hanger steak and my friend had the duck confit and both meats were fresh and delicious. Definitely a spot to check out for a special occasion!
Sorrel,Mediterranean,"1158 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4W 2L9 Canada",ON,43.6802296,-79.3910738,5,My husband and I dined here in February. It was a great romantic atmosphere with an amazing menu of delicious items and drinks. We sat at the bar and the staff were so accommodating and friendly. The food. Reasonable portions and flavourful. Can't get enough. Would definitely recommend and will visit again!
Sorrel,Mediterranean,"1158 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4W 2L9 Canada",ON,43.6802296,-79.3910738,4,"Came here to celebrate our anniversary. The ambience was really nice and I also like the bright and well-lit restaurant. For a Wednesday night in the middle of a storm, it was quite packed. Our host was alright, not very warm/helpful with suggestions but did his job well and was also kind to take photos for us. The food was quite good. The grilled octopus, linguine and duck confit stood out! We had a flourless chocolate cake and ice cream for dessert which was also nice. I had mentioned it was our anniversary dinner ahead and when we arrived but I still had to ask for a candle for the dessert; there was pretty much no acknowledgement of the celebration which is unlike other restaurants I've visited. Otherwise, it was a nice experience but I doubt I'll be back."
Sorrel,Mediterranean,"1158 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4W 2L9 Canada",ON,43.6802296,-79.3910738,5,"Sorrel with their French Mediterranean inspired menu, it’s a perfect spot to chill. All the dishes we tried were great. Amazing value for the $2 oyster (if that is your kinda thing) Reservation is highly recommended as they have a full house every time we went. Great atmosphere. Lunch from Mon-Fri. Dinner only for Sat and closed on Sunday."
Nozomi Fusion Kitchen,Asian Fusion,"3415 Bathurst Street Toronto, ON M6A 2C1 Canada",ON,43.7270115,-79.4312798,5,"Got the chicken sandwich and it was delicious! Very juicy with a nice crunch to it. Perfect amount of sauce and the owner was awesome to talk to as well. It doesn't feel oily or greasy and the spicy mayo gives it a nice kick to it. Everything was packaged neatly and organized.

We were the first customer of the day and even got some free cookies! The chocolate chip cookie was so fresh and soft. I can eat a box of them.

Definitely would be back if I'm in the area again."
Nozomi Fusion Kitchen,Asian Fusion,"3415 Bathurst Street Toronto, ON M6A 2C1 Canada",ON,43.7270115,-79.4312798,5,"Just had their food, and it’s amazing! All made in-house. Family-owned business.

Know of the place because of the folks at Dope Cannabis, located across the street. Ordered online and picked it up. Ordered the honey hot chicken sandwich, added on the rancheros fries. Also got the Kalbi burger.

The hot honey chicken sandwich was the perfect combination of crispy, juicy and flavorful. Expect a spicy kick with the sauce and jalapeños, and the bun is just the right amount of softness. This sandwich will not disappoint. Actually the best chicken sandwich I’ve had in a long time.

The rancheros fries was a nice side choice. Meat with the fries was yummy and the addition of sauce, jalapeños, onions, etc. was a great combination.

The Kalbi beef burger was juicy and flavorful, packed between two pillow soft buns.

Since I picked it up, I visited the store. Small, cozy spot for pickup. No seating in-store other than a two-seater bench. Delightfully decorated inside. Also, love the yellow “Believe” (Ted Lasso reference) above their kitchen doorway.

Excited to try their poke bowl and other items on the menu next time!"
Nozomi Fusion Kitchen,Asian Fusion,"3415 Bathurst Street Toronto, ON M6A 2C1 Canada",ON,43.7270115,-79.4312798,5,Love this place. Everything is amazing. Burgers are California style smash and oh so good and decadent. The poke bowls are fantastic. It all comes down to the best quality ingredients. Don’t leave without trying a homemade cookie.
Nozomi Fusion Kitchen,Asian Fusion,"3415 Bathurst Street Toronto, ON M6A 2C1 Canada",ON,43.7270115,-79.4312798,5,"Absolutely amazing value for money! The food here is really tasty, good portion size, and won't make a dent on your wallet.

I've tried their chicken sandwhich and loved it: crispy skin, super tender meat l, nice springy bun, tangy secret sauce. Also tried the bulgogi bowl which I also enjoyed: sweet beef, good amount of side veggies.

Nozomi is a take-out spot so you'll been to grab and go. Despite that, the owners make it as welcoming and friendly an environment as any dine-in place. Male sure to stop by if you want a really tasty and affordable bite!"
Nozomi Fusion Kitchen,Asian Fusion,"3415 Bathurst Street Toronto, ON M6A 2C1 Canada",ON,43.7270115,-79.4312798,4,The food was pretty good.  They were kind enough to let me switch my order after the fact when I called them. Thankfully got the poke bowl because we like the tofu poke bowl better than the burger. The burger got too soggy by the time I got home. Should've asked to put the sauce on the side. Both are on the sweeter side. The cookie was ok because it was way too sweet. The owner was too busy to make a conversation with us but her husband was very sweet and even helped me put the food in my bag. The ambiance is very clean and they have a funny sign with a weighing scale!
Mezes,Greek,"456 Danforth Avenue Toronto, ON M4K 1P4 Canada",ON,43.6781397,-79.3502475,5,"Always great food, fresh, vibrant, tasty. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating, even at their most busiest time. Highly recommended."
Mezes,Greek,"456 Danforth Avenue Toronto, ON M4K 1P4 Canada",ON,43.6781397,-79.3502475,5,"One of my favourite Greek restaurants on the Danforth, we’ve been back multiple times and loved it every time! We typically get some skewers, dips (their pita bread with the dips are THE BEST) & a salad. This time we opted out for the seafood platter, which was delicious full of shrimp, calamari and grilled octopus! It was good, but definitely a lot for 2 people!!"
Mezes,Greek,"456 Danforth Avenue Toronto, ON M4K 1P4 Canada",ON,43.6781397,-79.3502475,5,"The service here is top notch. The food arrives fast and hot, dishes are replaced instantly once finished, and the water does not stop flowing. The restaurant is lively and the prices are better than some of the competitors down the street.

The fried calamari was truly excellent. The squid was abundant, juicy, and seasoned and fried perfectly.

The Aegean Fare Special was loaded with savoury meats and veggies. Unfortunately the moussaka was dryer than I’d prefer.

Overall, it was a 4.5 for me."
Mezes,Greek,"456 Danforth Avenue Toronto, ON M4K 1P4 Canada",ON,43.6781397,-79.3502475,4,"been here one time before and the food is amazing! Saganaki and the chicken breast plate were so damn good!
Other items ordered: lamb chop by piece, dolmades, grilled octopus.
Our waiter did not smile once though and the service was so blah - not engagement or enthusiasm at all."
Mezes,Greek,"456 Danforth Avenue Toronto, ON M4K 1P4 Canada",ON,43.6781397,-79.3502475,4,"It’s a pretty busy Greek restaurant. We tried their Lentil soup, grilled vegetables, grilled Octopus, and lamb chop. The food was good. The octopus had too much vinegar, and it became sour. It was cooked properly though, and not overbooked. We wanted the lamb chop to be medium rare, but it came out medium. It still tasted good. The staff was friendly; the place was clean and vibrant. Overall probably would go again."
Eastside Social,Seafood,"1008 Queen Street E Toronto, ON M4M 1K1 Canada",ON,43.6614591,-79.3391978,5,"Great place to watch the game and eat delicious food.  Loved that you could also see into the kitchen.

Tempura duck confit was tasty and crispy.
Dessert would have me returning.  It is big enough for 2, but I crushed it on my own. No complaints."
Eastside Social,Seafood,"1008 Queen Street E Toronto, ON M4M 1K1 Canada",ON,43.6614591,-79.3391978,4,"The vibe here was very good and I was overall a fan of the food. The kung pao broccoli was my favourite dish. I wasn’t expecting much from it but it was so tasty and the sauce was amazing. The tuna was also good although a small serving. All the appetizers were good to share.
My main was the fish and chips and that is the reason we are at 4 stars. It was genuinely nothing special but I had some of my wife’s  poke bowl and that was tasty. I would come back to try again and try something else next time."
Eastside Social,Seafood,"1008 Queen Street E Toronto, ON M4M 1K1 Canada",ON,43.6614591,-79.3391978,5,"We had a fantastic experience at the Eastside Social. Our party of 4 didn’t have a reservation on a Friday night and the busy Eastside social was so accommodating and lovely.

We had drinks by the bar while we waited for a table to become available and boy, let me tell you- they were so good!

Dinner was fantastic, definitely order the eggplant crisps! The olives were nostalgic, tasted just like my uncles olives from Italy. Our mains (pictured) were very satisfying, big portions, and had so much flavour.

Service was exceptional and so friendly - going above and beyond! Not to mention when we left, they still remembered our name.

We would definitely recommend the Eastside Social and can’t wait to come back!

Thanks for having us!"
Eastside Social,Seafood,"1008 Queen Street E Toronto, ON M4M 1K1 Canada",ON,43.6614591,-79.3391978,4,"We would probably need to come back and try dinner menu.
Brunch was ok. Burger buns were cold.
The kiddo didn't like the kid's menu at all.
We didn't like that it was super noisy (all tables were occupied), can't hear each other."
Eastside Social,Seafood,"1008 Queen Street E Toronto, ON M4M 1K1 Canada",ON,43.6614591,-79.3391978,4,"We ordered a smash burger and doner from their brunch menu. House-made aioli was amazing. The doner was definitely not your regular shawarma, it had a beef patty and and overwhelming sweet sauce. I still think the place is great, but i should have ordered something else."
Omai Restaurant,Japanese,"3 Baldwin Street Toronto, ON M5T 1L1 Canada",ON,43.6560802,-79.3926526,4,"Fresh quality food and enjoyed every dish.

Omai Restaurant,Japanese,"3 Baldwin Street Toronto, ON M5T 1L1 Canada",ON,43.6560802,-79.3926526,5,"Good food. On the pricey side as portion is small. Bring lots of people so you can try more items. Uni is recommended, tuna roll is bang for your buck."
Omai Restaurant,Japanese,"3 Baldwin Street Toronto, ON M5T 1L1 Canada",ON,43.6560802,-79.3926526,4,"Good food, slightly on the pricier side. Everything tasted nicely cooked and fresh. Service is great, attentive and friendly. We sat on the patio out front

Croquettes: nice and cheesy, crisp on the outside
Tomago temaki: the truffle overpowered the egg
Scallop temaki: our favorite bite
Bluefin futomaki: big pieces of tuna with freshly grated wasabi, really good
Omai futomaki: deluxe roll which are quite big

Could've done without the truffle flavor as it was quite strong that masked all the natural sense

Inside had a bar seating but felt very dark inside
They also have a tasting menu for $85/pp"
Omai Restaurant,Japanese,"3 Baldwin Street Toronto, ON M5T 1L1 Canada",ON,43.6560802,-79.3926526,3,"Bad quality fish. Overpriced. Worst uni ever had, especially considering the price.

We split a Tofu Pad Thai from the Summerlicious menu, and the mushroom sandwich. The amount of food was a lot, and it all tasted great.
The service was very kind."
Amsterdam Barrel House,Breweries,"87 Laird Drive Toronto, ON M4G 3T7 Canada",ON,43.706078,-79.3614605,4,"Nice service and ambiance. We ordered the chicken wings with apple butter sauce, brisket burger, and the pasta special (spicy sausage with penne). Overall, the food tasted good.

The chicken wings weren't worth it for its price. It's $17 for only 7 wings. They gave a lot of brisket for the burger which was great. The brisket can use a bit more sauce since it was a bit dry. The pasta was unremarkable."

When you are planning a milestone event like a Retirement Party....you want a lovely setting with great food and wonderful staff....Trisha (Events Manager) and the team at the Amsterdam Barrelhouse delivered on all counts!

I was so thankful for Trisha's kindness and support...there was not one request that was met with a willingness to make it happen.  Trisha and the restaurant managers helped make every detail (including the showing of photos, a special film and our music) a reality.

All of the guests loved the beautiful upstairs patio setting, great food and atmosphere created....I loved the magical evening!

Many thanks to the Amsterdam Barrelhouse for helping to make my celebration so wonderful!  I highly recommend having your next special event there!

Good burger, salad, and steak sandwich. The pizza is also great. Situated in Longo's renovated historic building, it is a unique experience."

Compliment the meal with drinks from the bar. All served by friendly and attentive staff. Portions are sized for sharing or if you're hungry they will fill the void.

Skylight Rooftop Bar,Desserts,"90 Bloor Street E 9th Floor Toronto, ON M4W 1A7 Canada",ON,43.67087,-79.3845923,4,"I love visiting this new hotel in downtown Toronto as they have a number of great venues, including the Skylight rooftop bar!
I recently brought a colleague for Summerlicious, and we had a great experience!
The portions and offerings for this menu are a bit different than the regular menu, but the quality and service are maintained. We weren’t able to enjoy the lovely patio given the weather, but it’s great if you have a chance!
You wouldn’t think that a typical hotel restaurant like this would be known for Middle Eastern fare, but it’s authentic  and delicious! We had the hummus with chicken, the baba ghanouj, as well as the Wagyu beef kebabs, and they were all very well presented, flavorful, and very filling!
They also make a mean, Paloma, which is my favourite beverage!
While you’re visiting, be sure to check out the beautiful library bar with a large open fireplace not to mention a Moët and Chandon vending machine!
Thank you, kindly and I’ll be back soon!"

However, the food was below our expectations and even below average compared any Mexican restaurant in Toronto. The presentations were perfect yet they fail to make up for the taste.

I would recommend going only for drinks."

There's a DJ spinning mostly (what seems like) latin-inspired music and the venue is just beautiful.  Can't wait for the summer-time when the patio opens up.  I can't really speak to the food, as just one person ordered the octopus, but she said she enjoyed it.  I ordered the chocolate dessert and it was amazing.  Our waitress was so amazing and attentive to our needs and she was so sweet and put sparklers on my dessert and took it off the bill - it was really nice.  Cocktails were great!  Would definitely come back for drinks again."

Everyone there working was awesome and nice. The food was delicious. My only comment is that there wasnt that many options for chicken and meat. Not many cuts of protein for the lunch menu. Also not many sides or appetizers for the all you can eat lunch as well. But for the cuts and options there were, they were super good"

This spot is great for gathering, sharing and meat lovers. If you have dietary restrictions, I recommend you stay away from this place, given everything is shared and it gets quite hard to keep everything tidy.

I hope they keep it up and I will keep coming back/keep ordering delivery."

Meat tastes very high quality and the servers are always on top of everything and very attentive brining you things immediately. We were a bit worried the lunch menu wouldn’t satisfy us as there are less options but it was still more than enough and you can still choose the dinner menu during lunch time if you really want. Beef is definitely our favourite as it’s a bit more marinated and we’d honestly be happy just getting it and skipping the pork. Hope to be back soon!"

As a restaurant where Korean and Japanese cuisines are well harmonized, I want to visit again next time. thank you

P.S. I was very satisfied with the way each individual was provided with convenient tongs to grill the meat."

Red meat we ordered is only beef which is very tasty. Cold noodle and bibim rice are strongly recommended. Every portion is small so we can try one each.

Tokyo Kitchen,Japanese,"20 Charles Street E Toronto, ON M4Y 1T1 Canada",ON,43.6690709,-79.3851306,4,"Came for a weeknight dinner with a friend just before 6pm. The restaurant is quite small (although they do have patio seating once the weather warms up enough) and filled up quickly, so I'd recommend making a reservation if you can.

I ordered the pork katsu curry. Pork katsu was cooked well, very fresh and not dry at all. The curry was rich and came with chunks of beef. Rice was on the sticky side though. But overall, tasty and very good quality/quantity for the price.

Service is friendly although it was a bit difficult to get their attention at times. Would be helpful if they updated the menu on their website, as some items are no longer available."

Once we sat down, it felt like everything went really fast. We were served our meals and the side we ordered in a matter of minutes. We got a side of tempura, one sashimi don, one chicken katsu, and one beef sukiyako udon. The food was delicious, and even the atmosphere was really nice.

Yummy Korean Food Restaurant,Korean,"620 Bloor Street W Toronto, ON M6G 1K7 Canada",ON,43.6646826,-79.4140715,4,"Yummy is a pleasant surprise with good quality, big portions and low pricing. The Bulgogi on rice ($12) had a nice hint of smoke flavor but was dry. The noodle with red sauce and fish cake ($12) was a generous serving. Seafood pancake was my favorite - extra crispy and crunchy, although took time to come out.

Every table here is a large booth with high back rest, gives you lots of privacy.

Very low price point, and 10% discount when paying cash.

This has become my new go to for K-food.

Highly recommend."

Yummy and cheap!! It's a nice comfy place for 2 -4 ppl. The tables are nice even if its only 1 or 2. If you come when it is busy, you have to wait at the front but the service is pretty fast and the one girl with the glasses is always very polite with me. I appreciate it very much. Food is delicious! Cheaper than majority of Korean restaurants I've been to. Great value for your dollar."
Yummy Korean Food Restaurant,Korean,"620 Bloor Street W Toronto, ON M6G 1K7 Canada",ON,43.6646826,-79.4140715,5,"I have been coming to this place (since the days at their old location) for more than 8 years.

This is the best Korean restaurant based on portion sizes, value-for-money, and flavors! And service is as good as humanly possible, given how busy this place is. It is always busy for a good reason!

The quality of the food has been very consistent over the years! Great job! And I must say I love all the Banchan.  The kimchi and the potatoes always hit the spot!

Yummy Korean Restaurant is an institution of Toronto like Swatow and Manpuku! ❤️

One thing I would suggest is to update a small portion of the tables to be 2-tops, so the flow of customers (especially solo diners and couples) can be managed more effectively.

Another thing is that I will recommend servers to ask about drinks orders, or at least mention both alcoholic and non-alcoholic options. This should help boost drink sales!

Last but not least, I recommend creating an Instagram page to connect with your fans! Yes, many Torontorians are your fans!"

My friend took me here on a Thursday night for dinner and it was really good! We ordered 3 dishes and had leftovers for tomorrow.

Okonomi House Restaurant,Japanese,"23 Charles Street W Toronto, ON M4Y 2R4 Canada",ON,43.668238,-79.3871472,5,"I went here with a friend and we ordered a shrimp Japanese pancake and a chicken teriyaki. The shrimp Japanese pancake was delicious! It came with the right amount of fluffiness, sauce, and fillings. Definitely get the fish flakes as an addition, otherwise I feel like the pancake would be lacking such a vital component. The chicken teriyaki was pretty standard that you could find anywhere. However, their pancakes are certainly worth it - I find Japanese pancakes are also not always super common to find. The prices were also super reasonable, this place is definitely worth a try."

osaka style okonomiyaki, that’s fairly priced and portioned. flavours were great and savoury, we tried the beef, squid, both great options! yakisoba was also memorable. definitely recommend to visit, just a heads up there can be a bit of wait during the evening! Also, I recommend the plum wine, it’s delicious!"

But let's talk about the real reason you're here - the tacos! The menu is full of delicious options that cater to all tastes and dietary needs. From traditional beef and chicken to fish, every taco is bursting with flavor and fresh ingredients.

What really sets this taco joint apart is the attention to detail. Each taco is made to order with care and precision, and the flavors and textures are perfectly balanced. Whether you're looking for something spicy and bold or mild and comforting, there's a taco here for you.

And let's not forget about the sides - the chips and guacamole are the perfect accompaniment to your meal. And if you're feeling thirsty, there's a great selection of drinks to choose from, including delicious margaritas and refreshing beers.

This place is a nice restaurant, but of an elevated atmosphere. I could take a date here for a nice dinner kinda vibe. Intimate. Staff are friendly and helpful.
Classic margarita on point.
Guacamole - tastier than most. Smooth not so chunky and you'll want to order 0ne for each individual.
Pastor, barbacoa, fish and steak (arrachera I think) all super flavorful.
House sauce is very flavorful, heat forward, but not there to punish you. White people may find it too much, but the heat does not linger long. I will 100% be back."

We ordered 3 tacos to go. The Al Pastor, Black Tiger Shrimp, and Fried Fish.

The tacos come with one tortilla and the size is just fine. Not too big, not too small. (More filling than Pastor Taco on Gerard St for comparison).

The Al Pastor - really dry. I was worried about this as other reviews state dry meat. I indeed, also received dry meat. There's potential with the flavours here, but the meat was dry and hard to enjoy.

Black Tiger Shrimp and Fish tacos were fine, but nothing memorable.

Considering this place's other location has great reviews and they are still working on opening their dine-in space, I plan to return in a couple months to give them another chance because this area needs more taco spots!"

The Cheese Quesadilla combo which comes with Tortilla chips was disappointing as the portions were very small and barely any chips. It was not filling.

The girl couldn’t explain what is the dish about, but probably she was not her fault, she was rushing, it was only one waitress for paying attention to the tables, take out, pick up and everything, maybe they need more staff to fill. From my point of view the price is so high 1 taco for $7.50+ tax but I guess they wanted to give Mexican gourmet food experience but as expensive gourmet food the customer service should be at the same level or above"

Its certainly different from other pho restaurants as their soup was unique imo. If you prefer non greasy clean taste this is not the place for you. But if you love rich meaty flavour you should definitely give this place a try.
Price was cheap for the amt of food they serve. I felt like I shouldve brought 4 people to finish two bowls  of noodle.
*I really liked Hue special which they only sell on Fri, Sat and Sunday. Never had any bowl like this elsewhere. Broth was so rich w flavour and it had interesting toppings like crab cake, meat ball (which looked lik a spam) and variety of tendon, beef & more.
*Regular pho comes with huge chunks of beef with a bone. Broth was quite greasy with sooo much meat but because of that, its so rich w meaty flavour.

**be warned of the XXL portion. For ladies, I recommend sharing one bowl. I eat alot but I was defeated after eating 1/3 of the bowl.
**there will be a line but wait time is short, about 10mins or so.
**this place would be perfect esp during wintertime 👍👍"

Title: ""A Culinary Journey to the Far East: Tao Northern Chinese Cuisine""

When seeking a dining experience that waltzes across the tightrope of exotic flavors, lavish presentation, and warm hospitality, one need look no further than Tao Northern Chinese Cuisine. Tucked away at 220 Laird Drive, this hidden gem is a veritable treasure trove of dishes that transport your taste buds to the mystical Far East.

Our culinary odyssey commenced with the Chicken Won Ton Noodle Soup, a soothing symphony of delicate flavors that nourished our souls. The Chicken Spring Rolls were next to grace our table; their golden, crispy exteriors revealing a delectable filling that married the playful textures of perfectly seasoned chicken with the earthy crunch of fresh vegetables.

Tao's Chicken Fried Rice danced on our palates, a whirlwind of flavors that united smoky, caramelized notes with the tangy sweetness of pineapple. The Lemon Chicken was a true masterpiece, as if Da Vinci himself had crafted the dish. Tender, succulent pieces of chicken were lightly battered, then bathed in a vibrant lemon sauce that dazzled the senses with its perfect balance of sweetness and acidity.

The Pepper Beef left us utterly speechless, with its tender morsels of beef that melted in our mouths, juxtaposed against the fiery heat of black pepper and the delicate sweetness of caramelized onions. The Assorted Seafood & Vegetables was a delightful marine medley, harmoniously combining the briny freshness of the ocean with the natural sweetness of colorful, crisp veggies.

As for the Chicken Singapore Vermicelli, it was a tantalizing fusion of textures and flavors, each strand of vermicelli expertly coated in a fragrant curry sauce that bewitched the senses.

Our adventure culminated in the sinfully delicious Deep Fried Bananas with Vanilla Ice Cream and strawberries. The bananas, enrobed in a feather-light batter and fried to crispy perfection, were the perfect accompaniment to the creamy, velvety ice cream, while the vibrant strawberries added a dash of color and tang to the exquisite dessert.

Throughout our epicurean escapade, we were guided by the ever-charming Lambert, whose genuine warmth and attentiveness elevated our dining experience to celestial heights. The ever-vigilant Manager Jackie ensured that every detail of our evening unfolded seamlessly, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in the culinary wonderland that is Tao Northern Chinese Cuisine.

In a world of commonplace dining experiences, Tao Northern Chinese Cuisine is a beacon of culinary creativity and hospitality. It's not just a meal; it's an enchanting voyage to a land where flavors reign supreme and gastronomic dreams come true."
TAO Northern Chinese Cuisine,Chinese,"220 Laird Drive Toronto, ON M4G 3X2 Canada",ON,43.7123357,-79.3644713,3,"Tried this spot as it’s close by and we were hoping to satisfy our dumpling craving. We tried the Xiao Long Bao (pork soup dumplings), steamed chicken dumplings, steamed pork & chive dumplings, and pan fried pork buns.

We felt satisfied with the amount we ordered due to the small sizes of the dumplings and we found the flavours to be quite fresh.

Our favourite dish was the pork bun- it was so warm, the filling was delicious, flavourful and fresh.

The dumplings we found to be just okay. All in all, we spent $40, which I think is definitely a little pricier than other dumpling options relative to quality. The soup dumplings were not comparable to others I’ve had - they were mediocre and just didn’t get the job done in my opinion. As well, we found the wrapping of the dumplings to be quite thick. I don’t think that we would order dumplings from this spot again; however seeing the reviews others have left, I’m definitely open to trying other dishes here.

The staff were very pleasant and friendly, and our order was ready in 15 minutes- quick and prompt!"

TAO Northern Chinese Cuisine,Chinese,"220 Laird Drive Toronto, ON M4G 3X2 Canada",ON,43.7123357,-79.3644713,3,"We tried the lunch menu and the food was a bit underwhelming, think a fast food place on the food court quality. The prices are reasonable though and the lunch combos include a choice of meat, soup, spring roll and rice. The service was good, so it is ok for what it is. If you are in the area and you want a quick Chinese meal, it is not too bad."
EAT BKK Thai Kitchen,Thai,"4704 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M2N 5M4 Canada",ON,43.759247,-79.4107601,4,"1st time trying this place during lunch. Had late lunch n restaurant still full. Was greeted by two amazing and smiling wait staff. Added nicely to the restaurant coziness.

Yellow curry was amazing n had right balance of Thai herbs which is hard to find in Toronto. Each lunch special also came with Thai spring roll...which came hot n freshly fried. Luv hot food! Slightly surprised with crispy pork as it was cooked in heavy sauce so the pork wasn't crispy but since sauce was good, dish was ok at the end. What was unexpected was the hot & sour soup which had enormous amount of black pepper. Was hoping Thai soup so surprised with Chinese. Just a note that there's limited parking space (only 1 spot in front and 3 paid street parking on the south Street beside Hero burger) so easier to take public transit/walk."

And also added the Laab grilled chicken! A must try. I always order the Laab wings and had asked if they had it in chicken form. They do. They have a cash discount available.

I ordered the braised beef with rice. My friend ordered the veg pad see ew. And we got wings.

My order had something wrong with it. Had to send it back and they corrected it. I hope. They sent us complimentary spring rolls for the experience. I cant dock them. Mistakes and accidents happen. They did well to make up for it.

Helpful staff, though they were slammed with many customers and pick ups.

These wings are on my top 5 list of best wings. A must try."

The server was so sweet and she did everything for us to enjoy our dining experience. Excellent service. The food was just perfect. The ambiance of the restaurant was like wow. We felt like we were in Europe. The tour of the Gallery was impeccable.
RH Courtyard Restaurant at RH Toronto,Cafes,"3401 Dufferin Street RH Toronto Toronto, ON M6A 2T9 Canada",ON,43.7249034,-79.4555998,4,"During our recent visit to the restaurant, my wife and I had a satisfying dining experience. I opted for the shaved prime rib sandwich and found it to be quite delicious. The flavors were well-balanced, and the meat was tender and flavorful. My wife, on the other hand, chose the quarter chicken, which was cooked to perfection. The chicken was juicy, tender, and had a delightful crispiness to the skin.

The restaurant itself had a charming and elegant ambiance. However, one minor downside was that the tables were positioned a bit too close together, which made it feel a bit cramped at times. On our way to the bathroom, we had the opportunity to browse the furniture they sell, which was a unique and interesting touch.

While the overall experience was enjoyable, we did find the service to be a little slow. It would have been great if the staff were more attentive and prompt in attending to our needs. Nevertheless, the friendly and accommodating nature of the staff made up for the slight delay in service.

In conclusion, the restaurant provided us with tasty food, a pleasant atmosphere, and a glimpse into their unique furniture offerings. Although the tables were a bit close together and the service was a touch slow, these minor drawbacks did not significantly impact our overall positive dining experience."

It has a very tall and delicate ceiling and there also have a lot of green plants around you. The food presentation and portion is terrible. All of our main courses only have one piece of parsley as garnish. And for Salmon and lobster roll just have additional piece of lemon. There is no side dish with any of those main courses. I feel really disappointed about that because the price does not match with food quality. The only thing make me feel happy is their service. Our waiter is super nice, she pay attention to any details that we asked. Also, she replaced our steak after we told her that was over cooked. She said sorry to us because the steak was bad. I really appreciate for her service."

The interior is decked out in the most beautiful and luxurious couches and chandeliers. The entirety of the main floor is just brightly lit with the warmth from the chandeliers and it makes the whole atmosphere so warm and inviting.

The food was also quite good too. We got the lobster roll, the half roasted chicken, and the gem lettuce salad, and all of them were superior. The price is a bit in the higher side but they really do give you an amazing experience, so I would say that it’s reasonable.

The waitstaff was also super nice and since we were celebrating a birthday they even came out towards the end to give us a celebration dessert (a chocolate chip cookie) it was so cute and unexpected and overall really made our day.

In short, if you get the chance to, please give this place a visit. The food is good and the atmosphere is even better, but just note that the price is on the higher side."

The chicken was a bit dry in the caesar salad but the rest of the salad was fresh. The truffle fries are great to share.

Overall, the food tasted very good. With the pricing and atmosphere they’ve set, you do expect things to be high quality and to not miss a beat. It is expensive for brunch but makes for a solid outing once in a while. 4 stars."

The service is top notch and the staff is extremely friendly. I’ve been here quite a few times, so if you’re planning a trip here, make sure to order the Gnudi, and if you like fish, sharing the grilled seafood board is a must. The only downside this visit was the pizza was undercooked.. could’ve got a better char on it. Also, portion sizes are very generous so you are able to share everything with your table if you like to eat family style."

Carpaccio di Manzo 💕
Grande Fritti di Mare 💕
Gnudi ai Funghi 👌
Pizza N'duja 💕
Tiramisu 💕

I order Calamari at most places I see it on the menu but I've got to say this is probably the best calamari I've ever had 🤤 it was so fresh and soft with a light crisp batter exterior! Carpaccio was very light and seasoned very well, topped with alot of parm & arugula and a soft and cheewy homemade bread. The gnudi (gnoochi) was melt in your mouth soft, I've never had it at such a soft texture before- very different but also so good with the mushroom truffle sauce! I'm very spicy sensitive and this was the first time I had a N'duja pizza I could handle, thanks to the great recommendation of our bar server! Spreading the burrata over the top of the pizza likely helped a lot. The tiramsu was rich and creamy, a bit thicker texture than others I'm used to and loved it!

We sat at the bar and our bar server was great, he provided the best recommendations and everything we had was amazing!

Can't wait to come back and try other dinner items and the brunch menu!"

We definitely enjoyed the food even though it was super loud. We could barely hear each other. I’m not sure if the restaurant was too small with too many people, but it was loud and crowded."

We didn't catch our servers name but he was awesome! Super friendly, honesty, no fuss when we said we were just in for drinks (at first). Gave a great recommendation for food. Honestly, he was a big part of us enjoying our experience. It was refreshing to have such a memorable and pleasant server.

We enjoyed 2 rounds of the espresso martinis. We can't wait to come back on another weekend and enjoy the cocktail hour specials (I believe between 3-5pm!)."

There were a few things I did not enjoy. But first, the restaurant itself was clean and bright. The tables small and enough for 2 people and two bowls of noodles. The service was good and i liked their bubble tea.
I ordered the pickled vegetable beef noodle soup. The beef was so overcooked it was all crumbling in my soup and there wasnt a lot. The noodle portion sizes were crazy big. CRAZY BIG. There were so many noodles in there it felt like the more I ate, the more noodles there were. The flavour was alright.
It was definitely something that can be shared among two people or they could even have a size small."

One of the best noodle dishes in the city for sure!!! Please visit the restaurant as well as it will enhance your experience.

Ordered through Doordash before once and enjoyed the beef noodles. This time tried the Braised Beef Noodles and it was delicious!! Reheated the broth but that was due to my dasher not putting in a heating bag. 9.2/10

Restaurant is relatively small but humble and I really enjoyed my meal! Fair price point for flavor and quantity. Definitely appreciated that!"

The service was excellent and the food super yummy. Everything was reasonably priced. Their beer list is extensive with a lot of yummy options on tap. Where they are lacking is their cocktail menu. They were unable to make several simple bar staples - but I suppose that’s just not their jam.
I had their special “chicken Big Mac burger” which was amazing. Their fries were excellent - although my DH found them too greasy.

They have a curated menu with probably 10-15 or so options yet somehow all of them sounded insanely delicious. In addition to that, if you check out their Instagram you’ll see they have a daily special. To come up with something of that caliber everyday is extremely impressive. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food and service.

The fish tacos are some of the best I’ve ever had, great fusion flavours. That being said, I’m confident that anything off this menu would be amazing. Everyone at our table was very happy with their meals, and they have a great drink menu to go with it. Definitely stop here for a meal if you’re in the area but it’s also worth going out of your way to get there."

I had an order that was less spicy but will try the regular spiced one next time. The flavours were on point. The pork neck bone was not boiled/simmered enough. The flavours of the broth was not infused enough into the bones as the pork bones didn’t break apart easily. Overall the flavour profile was there but just required a bit more time in the pot. The Kimchi that came with the side dishes were delicious. Service was fine since we went in the late afternoon. They are between a 3 - 4 star, I will make adjustments base upon my next visit."
Mabu Generation,Taiwanese,"575 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4Y 1Z3 Canada",ON,43.6656019,-79.3846082,3,"Overall, Mabu Generation is rather mediocre all things considered. Although some menu items here do stand out, the majority are exceptionally overpriced. On busy nights, you can expect to join a virtual Queue and will have to go elsewhere and wait for a table to open meanwhile, which detracts from the experience.

The atmosphere is rather flashy and aesthetic, though not necessary comfortable. It feels more so like a trendy pub at times, as it can get quite crowded and loud.

Of the food, notable appetizers include the okonomiyaki fries and the Deep Fried Tofu with Garlic Sauce, both being exceptionally flavourful for the price. I don't recommend the BBQ crab sticks as they tasted as if they were overseasoned with pepper. Entree-wise, I highly recommend sharing the Mabu Egged Sukiyaki with Rice, although pricey, it is exceptionally filling and is definitely a meal fit for more than one person. I'd advise against getting the House Special Deep Fried Pork Chop with Mapo Tofu sauce on rice. For the price, it isn't really noteworthy, nor does it taste as spicy as one would expect of mapo Tofu and is overall a letdown.

I will note however that the rice bowls are decently filling, and probably one of the few decent recommendations at Mabu. Likewise, the only other solid options at Mabu are the desserts, but they are exceptionally overpriced. If you're fine with burning a bit of cash, sharing either the mango or matcha honey cube toast ice cream tower with friends is a solid choice, same applies to the Mabu House Special Grass Jelly with Brown Sugar Milk Tea.

To conclude, Mabu Generation is overpriced, underwhelming and overrated."
Mabu Generation,Taiwanese,"575 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4Y 1Z3 Canada",ON,43.6656019,-79.3846082,4,"I dined at Mabu Generation 麻布 at the Yonge & Wellesley location. As its website sums it up, it's a trendy Taiwanese fusion cuisine. I found the staff provided excellent service and by default check on me to see if everything is ok and refilled my ice water by default. Interesting and unique decor with all the nostalgic artwork that reminds us back home and the memories.

I ordered the Tawianese spicy beef soup noodles. It's spicy, just the way it should be, spicy broth. $16.99 + tax isn't cheap per say but at downtown location and inflation, it's the norm nowadays.

Overall, I enjoyed my visit."
Mabu Generation,Taiwanese,"575 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4Y 1Z3 Canada",ON,43.6656019,-79.3846082,4,"Pretty good Taiwanese spot. I loved the decor and vibe. There were retro movie posters and a large cute mural on the opposite wall. Everything appeared to be made of wood. The food was fairly good. I really liked the hot plate. I found the hot pot to be just okay. The portion was good for 2 people. Taste-wise it was okay, not amazing. The desserts looked pretty ridiculous and very sweet. The service was very good and attentive. I would probably come for the other sizzling plates and maybe the dessert with a group."
Mabu Generation,Taiwanese,"575 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4Y 1Z3 Canada",ON,43.6656019,-79.3846082,4,"I got many recommendations for this restaurant. The food was great: crispy chicken, soft and juicy pork feet. The cocktail was pretty and not strong.
But the customer service experience was not good:
1. the menu needed to scan QR code, while the network was super bad in the restaurant. I struggled for a while until I was told there was wifi available by waiters.
2. The crispy chicken rice actually included egg, but not mentioned on the menu. Then I added extra egg while ordering. At the end I got 2 eggs and no one reminded me of it…

Overall it’s great and some customer service experience can be improved."
Mabu Generation,Taiwanese,"575 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M4Y 1Z3 Canada",ON,43.6656019,-79.3846082,5,"Went in to grab a small bite late at night. Now I think I found my new favourite! Their food is so delicious and so well seasoned. When I came in, the restaurant was PACKED, we sat after 10-15 mins and the wait was worth it, the manager even gave us free dessert as an apology for waiting. Their restaurant was closed when we ordered but they even waited for us until we finished. So happy about the service and the food, it’s rare but definitely  a gem"
Nomé Izakaya,Lounges,"4848 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M2N 5N2 Canada",ON,43.7625081,-79.411549,5,"So happy to be so close to one of my favourite spots for oysters, sushi rolls and other Japanese fares. Love the yuzu cocktails and unique take on dishes./ Absolutely love the salmon roll with asparagus and apple. Such an interesting flavour pairing and it was so filling!

Definitely love bringing folks here for the vibe and it’s so conveniently located right off Yonge and Sheppard, near the highway and transit. Parking is tricky if it’s full but other than that it’s a great location.

Make sure to try it out at least once and head over Tuesday and Wednesday for specials."

Pretty nice vibes but they had a mandatory 18% gratuity for a group our size. We tried various items. Their sushi rolls were not conventional but not my favourite. I liked the octo wasabi appetizer and it was pretty good with the oyster too.
Nomé Izakaya,Lounges,"4848 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M2N 5N2 Canada",ON,43.7625081,-79.411549,4,Food tasted pretty good. We enjoyed the seared salmon roll the most. However menu prices are on the higher end. Service was good and ambience was also nice. They have $1 oysters on Tuesdays and Wednesdays!
Nomé Izakaya,Lounges,"4848 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M2N 5N2 Canada",ON,43.7625081,-79.411549,5,"What a susprised for this little izakaya.  We couple frds gather for drinks and food.  They have $1 per oyster, which is good for what we came.  We ordered 5 dozen with other food.  Food is acceptional good. Service is fast for the 1st round.  Abit slow for next round as the restaurant got busy at late night.  It is a good place for some drinkz Nd food. Chill and relax.  Highly recommeded."
Nomé Izakaya,Lounges,"4848 Yonge Street Toronto, ON M2N 5N2 Canada",ON,43.7625081,-79.411549,4,"Definitely on the pricey side but loved the creative touches they added to the items on the menu and the quality of the food. Restaurant ambience was lovely  and felt classy.

We had the Seared Salmon roll, Cali Donburi, East and West Coast Oysters, Crispy Pork Belly, and their specialty sakes. Food took a bit to arrive but it was absolutely worth the wait.

Servers were also very friendly. Sometimes took a little to get their attention as it was busy  but generally very attentive.

Consider coming with a group of friends as they have many shareable options.

Overall a great experience, will be coming again in the future."
Itacate,Mexican,"998 St. Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M6E 1A2 Canada",ON,43.679555,-79.4372325,5,Probably the best tacos in Toronto. I’m not the biggest taco connoisseur but I think anyone that likes tacos and has a half decent palette would appreciate this place. This is a very small restaurant that is out of the way but it’s worth travelling to. Don’t expect a lot from the decor. It’s a food served on paper plates type of place. Incredibly nice staff. Everything I had was great.
Itacate,Mexican,"998 St. Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M6E 1A2 Canada",ON,43.679555,-79.4372325,4,"Chorilocos nachos were fantastic - just the right amount of heat, loads of flavour, and lots of crunch! Beware, you’re likely to fill up on these sausage-topped nachos before your tacos even arrive.

I really enjoyed the shrimp taco, but the volcan (steak), pastor (marinated pork), choriqueso (cheese and sausage), and pescado (fish) tacos tasted just alright.

Very limited indoor and outdoor seating. No frills, cash only, authentic and local."
Itacate,Mexican,"998 St. Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M6E 1A2 Canada",ON,43.679555,-79.4372325,4,"An authentic, small and family run place. I loved their taco, very fresh and felt like a homemade one. It's cash only by the way, but they take e-transfer too."
Itacate,Mexican,"998 St. Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M6E 1A2 Canada",ON,43.679555,-79.4372325,4,"Thought this place was a bit pricey for what you get. We ordered the torta sandwich with pork and it was very large and can be split between 2 people - very tasty. Opted out of the tacos since fancier dining establishments charge the same amount per taco if not less and this place is more of a take out or quick bites place. Also got the beef quesadilla and it was ok, wasn’t wowed by it."
Itacate,Mexican,"998 St. Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M6E 1A2 Canada",ON,43.679555,-79.4372325,5,"Itacate is a small, family-run taqueria on St. Clair West. We usually come to St. Clair for sushi (but Shunoko is gone now 😭), and always walked by Itacate on the way to get dessert at Futura.

There isn’t a lot of seating and a lot of people get their food to-go. However, we were able to grab a table near the door where there was additional window seating. Expect longer wait times during peak hours.

The place has a bunch of different luchador masks adorning the walls which were super cool. The kitchen is open and you can see them preparing the food right in front of you.

We got 7 tacos for $8 each, served with 2 hot sauces. It is on the pricier side compared to other Toronto taco places we’ve been to but the food was delicious nonetheless.

Good eclectic menu that tries to cater to different palates and needs. My friends loved the food. I felt it could have been a bit better in terms of the flavor. I got the coconut shrimp, chowder and the caramel/cake dessert. Nevertheless it was minor compared to the whole experience. The string of people that keep coming and the fact that its always packed is a testament to them being one of the best places to be in this area!"

Now coming to the food, it was refreshing and mouth watering. We tried multiple dishes like mango salad, chicken satay, beef salad, one shrimp dish, one crab dish, stir fried beef, stir fried chicken, green curry, iced tea and no complaints and a special thanks to the chef for the mango and beef salad. I would highly recommend this place and would love to be back again."

But take note that I just came back from Thailand few months ago so my tastebuds are tamed to real thai authentic cuisines. Pad thai and tom yum was good. Khao soi is very different from what I used to get in Northern Thailand. Tasted a bit too artificial.
Service is superb, nice smiley Thai staffs."

The mild option is pretty blunt. If you order mild, make sure you ask them to give you extra chilli paste on side. If you add their Thai Chilli in soup, it will make the soup 10 times better. You will get the kick. I loved their Mango Salad, Tom Kha, Pad Thai, Penang Curry the most."

It’s a tad bit disorganized if im being honest but I don’t mind cause it’s made up for overall with everything else. If you’re an impatient person or just very critical of the places you eat this might not be the place for you. If you’re looking for a casual place to eat some good food then it’s pretty great."

It was mine and my wife's first time and the food and drinks were great. I had the mexitaco beer which was a light tasting lager and my wife a strawberry margarita. Both drinks were brought instantly as well as the food. I cannot say how quick it was because we ordered it and less than 10 minutes later we had the food we ordered.

We ordered the nachos and tacos de birra. The chips were fresh tasting and crispy and delicious and I would definitely recommend them. 👌 The tacos de birra were phenomenal and I cannot say enough good about them I loved the flavourful beef, the complimentary sauces and the beef au jus wasn't necessary but a nice touch.

The food was so good we also tried the baja fish tacos and then shared the churros.

Overall the experience was great and all of the staff was so very friendly and helpful.

I will definitely return probably next weekend for the live music and more of their delicious food."

It’s quite small and unassuming. As a veteran home smoker I’m often critical of smokehouse’s as “you can’t beat my own cooking”. Beach House Smokehouse does not disappoint! As soon as you walk in, the sweet aroma of authentic BBQ fills the air.
I’m greeted by people that are proud of they are serving. I ordered the ribs with the intention of bringing some home. They offered BBQ sauce. I took it just in case my ribs would be dry. That sauce remained untouched as the ribs were juicy and perfectly cooked. They let me try a piece of brisket and…. I have no words. Melt in your mouth.
I would highly recommend to any smoke enthusiasts and I will definitely be back!"

Beach Hill Smokehouse,Barbeque,"172 Main Street S Toronto, ON M4E 2W1 Canada",ON,43.6841063,-79.3004064,3,"I was traveling in Toronto and took a train to this side of the down to try this restaurant. I ordered their ribs and brisket.

Ribs were very meaty (nearly St.Louis style) and prepared pretty well. I should say that they were cooked for enough time so they were tender. Yet, there was still too much fat that was oozing out, so overall they didn't taste very pleasant. Personally I would like them to be cooked a bit longer to render the fat.

The brisket was well trimmed and cooked. Yet, the brisket itself, especially the flat muscle, was very thin, feels like those cheaper ones from Walmart. And it had a bit weird taste at the first bite. I personally didn't enjoy that much, and I think it's related to the meat quality, not cooking skills. I also had a couple of slices of point muscle, they were okay. Afterall, they were not high-priced, though I would be willing to pay a bit more for slightly higher quality of meat."

Everything was tasty but only 2/5 dishes were excellent. The decor inside is seriously lacking as well. #10 was really good! The cold rolls were a good size but were a bit bland compared to other places I've been. #12 had lots of veggies and good flavors. I didnt love the basil chicken.. Res curry was good too.

Sea Witch Fish and Chips,Fish & Chips,"636 Saint Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M6C 1A9 Canada",ON,43.6822977,-79.4240366,3,"Fish and chips is a classic dish that I hold near and dear to my heart. The perfect combination of fried fish, crispy fries, and tangy tartar sauce is hard to resist.

Sea Witch Fish and Chips boasts a welcoming atmosphere and friendly staff. The main staff members were knowledgeable and helpful, but I suspect the person who was battering and frying the fish that day may have been new to the job.

Their menu offers four different types of fish: halibut ($26), haddock ($17.50), trout ($18), and pickerel ($19). Although I typically prefer white fish, I decided to try the pickerel, and I was pleasantly surprised by the well-seasoned fish, despite the thick batter. The fries were decent, but a bit inconsistent in texture.

While my experience at Sea Witch Fish and Chips was good, I believe there is room for improvement. I would be willing to give it another try if I were in the area. Overall, I would give Sea Witch Fish and Chips a 3.5 out of 5 rating."
Sea Witch Fish and Chips,Fish & Chips,"636 Saint Clair Avenue W Toronto, ON M6C 1A9 Canada",ON,43.6822977,-79.4240366,4,"We first came here because we learned they fry everything in tallow! Far better for you than seed oils (vege, canola etc), and the taste is better too. I do think the first time we visited - right as they opened for dinner - was the best visit. The fish wasn’t too greasy, fries were good. Since then we’ve visited a couple more times, some visits it felt a bit greasy with differing levels of batter.

That being said, still enjoy coming here. The service is so friendly, and love the atmosphere and unpretentious vintage decor."

Our server Tianna must have been having a bad day and decided to take it out on us. She was very short and rude when asked simple questions like one would dining  out and not friendly at all. We got our amazing food (not all together but close enough) minus one persons meal being told it will be out shortly. After all four of the people finished eating and still no garlic fries to be found I told her we didn’t need the fries anymore as we are all finished and just the bill. I was then handed the interact machine with the total and when I asked for my bill with the items on it before I pay I was given a nasty look, she went and printed it and it was thrown on the table in front of me. The fries I never received was still on the bill even though she knew we haven’t received them. When I showed her that it was still on the bill it was then snatched out of my hand with another not so pleased look on her face. I have never been treated like that in any establishment and it was not the way we wanted our grad celebration to go for our daughter. Again food was amazing the the lady who sat us started off the evening wonderfully and was so nice just sucks it couldn’t continue. “Girls night grad fun” ruined by one person."

Asahiya Japanese Restaurant,Japanese,"309 Jarvis Street Whitehorse, YT Y1A 2H3 Canada",YT,60.7211728,-135.0573227,1,"Appaled at the level of customer service at this restaurant.  See photo attached, ordered Boat B.

First bullet point specifies that the order comes with California roll, tuna roll or salmon roll.  I chose the tuna roll.  My order came with both a California roll and tuna roll even though the bulletpoint says ""or"".  I noted this to the waiter and said perhaps it was a misunderstanding of the menu and that I could not eat California roll due to dietary restrictions, and I had properly specified when giving the order that I wanted Tuna Roll.  The waitress indicated that she could change the order but it would be an extra $1.  She indicated that no one else has ever had this problem and that I am the only one.  Furthermore, she indicated that I should have told her about my dietary restriction.  Granted I should have done so, but a tuna roll doesn't go against my dietary restriction so I felt no need to indicate as such.  This was merely an error by the establishment in the grammatical structure/wording of their menu for Boat B.

I pointed my concern to the menu and the wording of the menu to my server.  I am sympathetic to the fact that it was a misunderstanding and miscommunication between both the server and I; however, the manner in which the menu miscommunication was dealt with by the server was subpar, including the adding of an additional $1.  I indicated to the server that I'll speak to her boss; however, no such manager addressed my concerns."

so on a Monday night , nothing special going on in town we decided to return as we have many times befor , we'll it was packed ! line ups on a Monday night ! go figure !
they did fantastic, service was great , food was better and the poor servers were run off their feet !
overall it was a 5 star service ! no way you could predict that many on a Monday!

Asahiya Japanese Restaurant,Japanese,"309 Jarvis Street Whitehorse, YT Y1A 2H3 Canada",YT,60.7211728,-135.0573227,3,"Great service. Food was so-so. They have a really good selection, and everything was reasonably fresh, taking into account this isn't Toronto or Vancouver. I got the Alaska roll. There were 5 pieces in the roll, a decent lunch serving for me. The rice was a little wet and tasted rather bland. There were maybe 7 pieces of salmon roe in the whole roll. The chopsticks for takeaway were the flimsier ones that can give you splinters. The wasabi was good though."
Asahiya Japanese Restaurant,Japanese,"309 Jarvis Street Whitehorse, YT Y1A 2H3 Canada",YT,60.7211728,-135.0573227,5,Delicious dinner with quick and friendly service.

The atmosphere was relaxed and enjoyable.

The staff managed by Megan were professional and attentive.
The pizza was top notch as was the pasta.
Megan recommended Burnt Toast for breakfast prior to our departure. We were so pleased with her service that we decided to give it a try.

Burnt Toast was packed and did not disappoint, service was great again the following day.

Thanks to Megan and the staff at both restaurants.

Both meals helped make Whitehorse even more memorable."
G & P Steak House & Pizza,Pizza,"209 Main Street Whitehorse, YT Y1A 2B2 Canada",YT,60.7191761,-135.0533582,4,"The service at this establishment was nothing short of exceptional, and the culinary experience was simply out of this world, for  Whitehorse! The host and our server exuded a delightful blend of charm and professionalism, ensuring that our dining experience was nothing short of perfection.

We decided to quench our thirst with a local beer for  Yukon Brewery Company , the name of which eludes my memory, and a classic Moscow mule.  The bar tendered nailed the Moscow mule and the beer was the second best since we have been in the Yukon.

In the mood for some delectable pasta, we opted for the seafood fettuccine and rustic vegetarian pasta dish. Both dishes were a symphony of flavors, leaving our taste buds dancing with joy. My dish , the seafood fettuccine was a true masterpiece, with succulent seafood perfectly complementing the velvety pasta. As for the Vegetarian dish my friend described it as any explosion of flavors! We couldn't help but marvel at the expert seasoning and juicy tenderness of the dish.

While the pasta dishes were undeniably superb, I must admit that I have a knack for recreating pasta dishes at home, and I felt I could do better. Nevertheless, the experience was a culinary delight that I would highly recommend to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience, in Whitehorse. We will most certainly be returning for both of these exceptional dishes, if we ever come back to this part of the world."

The atmosphere, the soft music, the comfortable seating, the FANTASTIC FOOD and the wonderfully, tentative staff.
Meagan is the manager and served us on both occasions.
We are from Ontario and were there on a fishing trip and plan to return....I digress.
We returned, not only for the food but, because of Meagan. She also runs a breakfast restaurant called BURNT TOAST.....naturally we ate there too.
A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE !!

I didn’t really enjoy the coleslaw or pasta salad’s, the beet and onion was good.

You definitely want to come here for a good sandwich, remember you need to come before 3pm otherwise sandwich bar is closed."

Sandwich counter is always delicious, but quality takes time so it's a bit slow even with the whole team working together.

Cannot recommend enough!"

For the main entree we ordered the spicy fish which hit the spot! The salad and fish was fresh and the rice is full of flavor and heavenly!!

The beef curry was also good and very tender.

We had the honor to meet the Master Chef Andrea and she makes everything with so much affection which shines through the wonderful flavors she is bringing to everyone.

They also have a fun table that showcases the visitors from all over the world- so when you stop by make sure to bring currency from your hometown to continue this fun tradition!

A must try when visiting Whitehorse!"

Had the jerk chicken roti, and it was quite tasty. The jerk chicken salad might be a good option too.

I'd go back to try the ox tail and goat for sure, I'd bet it would be very tasty and made authentic!"

The broth is delectable and the meat fresh. Fresh sprouts and lemon. Sriracha and Hoisin at the table so you can make it as spicy as you want. I had given up on this place but decided to give it another shot and I'm so glad I did.

Wish I could give 5 stars but sometimes the quality is world class, other times it'a like maybe the broth hasn't been prepared long enough and or the ingredients like bean sprouts aren't all that fresh"

The waitress saw us but didn’t come say hi or open the door. We wait till 11:40, she finally opened the door. Picked a little corner for us, we move the table a little bit but she stopped us right away with a condescending attitude towards us. We decided to step away from this trash attitude. Me and my friends in Whitehorse always come eat here, from now on, you will not see us ever again."

But I am addicted to this awesome soup and have to try it everywhere I can.

Well this place was a huge mistake. Staff were unfriendly, couldn't get our orders right and then tried to serve me someone else's food. When I told the guy that's not what I ordered he started yelling and slammed the food down. I don't care if you're having a bad day, or you work in a Vietnamese restaurant where nobody is Vietnamese, in the Yukon of all places. Learn to behave yourself. Be professional.

And here's a tip, anytime you mention tips or say something about not getting one, you're getting nothing.

As for the food, the soup was bland and tasted like dollar store chicken stock watered down. The vermicelli noodles looked like they came from a pack of Mr. Noodles and tasted like soggy cardboard. The meat was mostly fat and what looked like dog food scraps they got on sale from a refinery.

I wouldn't feed this to prisoners and I'm pretty sure they eat better than THAT anyhow."

Giorgios Cuccina,Italian,"206 Jarvis Street Whitehorse, YT Y1A 2H2 Canada",YT,60.7219179,-135.0553005,2,"I don’t often leave a bad review, but.
Upon arriving to our reservation at 7:30 we were waiting in the lobby for 35 minutes before getting sat. The table had been sitting empty otherwise. When we were sat it took about 15 minutes for our server to come and drop off waters and plates. She walked away before we could get a drink order in and one of the members of our party had to flag her down to order. We ended up ordering everything all at once because by this time it was 8:30 and we had no drinks or food. The appetizers came out quite quickly but by 9:45 we had still not eaten and we had at least 6 empty drinks piled to the end of the table(pictured below).
A member of the table asked to speak to management about the wait for our food and they said ‘yeah it’s ready it’s coming’. When they were setting down our food I had to ask them to actually clear the glasses so they could put the plate down. The manager or supervisor came over and gave us some wine but no apology, no reasoning, nothing. No water refills, no drink refills- super weird. We were really disappointed- a sorry goes a long way with bad service and as a server myself I just don’t think this is justified. The only reason I’m leaving two stars instead of one is because the food tasted good. I won’t be going back"
Giorgios Cuccina,Italian,"206 Jarvis Street Whitehorse, YT Y1A 2H2 Canada",YT,60.7219179,-135.0553005,4,"Nice restaurant.. look classy. Great food, friendly staff but quite a while to get our food.

Besides a small set back of waiting for someone to take my order (waiter came and apologized for a mis-communication between staff on who would be attending to my table) the food and drinks were delivered promptly, the food was delicious and well prepared, large serving of pasta and great dessert (I had the penne asparagus and berry new york cheesecake). Overall great service and food and next time I am in Whitehorse I would eat there again."
Giorgios Cuccina,Italian,"206 Jarvis Street Whitehorse, YT Y1A 2H2 Canada",YT,60.7219179,-135.0553005,1,"Place was about 1/3 full.  I was seated and got a glass of water and menus immediately.  10-min later a table of about 12 shows up beside me.  I left 15-min later when the waitress started taking their order.  A few different waitresses walked by my table over a dozen times with hardly a glance in the 25-min I sat there.

Thanks for the bad experience on Thursday May 11th 2023 at 6pm.

I went to Tony's Pasta and Grill and got prompt service and great food."

The service and food were quick, the place was clean and the food was tasty. The portions were gargantuan. The omelette could have easily fed two people!"
Gold Pan Saloon,Bars,"Best Western Gold Rush Inn 411 Main Street Whitehorse, YT Y1A 2B6 Canada",YT,60.71845,-135.05772,4,"This is one of the rare places that open for lunch as the rather famous places for bison burger or food is only open for dinner till late. This place is located at the first level of the Best Western Inn and there are 2 ways to enter it, via the main entrance of Best Western Inn and then the side door which is the main entrance of Gold Pan Saloon or you can go by the back door which gets you to the restrooms (which was how I entered but it doesn't matter as they still checked your vaccination status and ID).

Do note that this place has a lot of regulars (given that Whitehorse downtown is a very small downtown and everyone kind of knows each other). Don't be upset if they don't service you immediately. I found that the regulars there know the menu better than the servers. My server actually didn't know the price of the special of the day and how much the beers cost so she had to return to the bar to ask and get a menu to show us the price instead. All in all service is not strong here for new customers, but regulars know the service staff by name.

The bison burger is pretty nice (first time for me), gamey, lean, tasty, well marinated and burger well made. The fries were pretty good as well. As for the special of the day, it was butter chicken (ended up being an Indian style of butter chicken which was fine).

Beer was really cold and nice in a retro looking plastic cup (probably because many customers broke them after too many a glass).

Given they are one of the few lunch joints, I'm pretty happy with what I got, and service was never my emphasis anyway so this place is worth my time and stomach."
Gold Pan Saloon,Bars,"Best Western Gold Rush Inn 411 Main Street Whitehorse, YT Y1A 2B6 Canada",YT,60.71845,-135.05772,3,"Had a bison burger and some wings for take-out one night while staying at the Gold Rush Inn.

Although the place looks very dated and in need of a renovation, the food and drinks were very good. We returned twice in the same trip. We tried a few beers, and tried a variety of food and starters from breakfast to dinner. The only dish we didn't care for was the Gold Nuggets from the dessert menu. Was hoping for more of a donut hole, and instead was more like fried pizza crust dipped in brown sugar/cinnamon. But everything else was great! Would gladly return of in the area! 🍻 If my review helped, please give me a 👍 Cheers 🍺"
Gold Pan Saloon,Bars,"Best Western Gold Rush Inn 411 Main Street Whitehorse, YT Y1A 2B6 Canada",YT,60.71845,-135.05772,1,"I was here in Yukon for business. The food itself was decent, but literally the worst service i have ever witnessed, table was not clean when we were asked to sit down, our server never really checked in on us after food was brought out. When confronted about this, she complained that we ordered late and she’s handling 3 tables at once. You cannot just wave down any server, you have to wait for your own waiter who would disappear once they take your order. Our whole morning was ruined by her nonchalant attitude. We asked for takeout box and she almost threw the box on our table. Very disrespectful staff and entitled servers. When we asked for a manager to explain our situation better. She came back to our table and said ‘’I’m the manager and if we have any complains we could let her know’’, we asked if the owner is at the restraunt and her reply was (and i quote) this is a big establishment and the owner never comes at big restaurants like these. Which almost made us choke on our food lmao! we did not tip and told her that she’s the problem. I’m from Vancouver and sit at restaurants mostly for business meeting and never once had a complain from service. Not sure what was she trying to point out by bringing big establishment? 🤣 Would never recommend any visitors, not a worthwhile service for the money they’re charging."

The atmosphere was nice. They have a pleasant outdoor eating area, and everybody around me seemed to be enjoying themselves.

The only downside was how long it took for a server to take our order (20 minutes, estimated), especially since we had a toddler with us.

I hope to come back at some point this summer!"

The staffs were friendly and helpful.

Food was more enjoyable out in the patio. A sparrow was trying to snatch our nachos.

Their portions weren’t generous but just enough to feel stuffed.

They have specials written on the whiteboard, so make sure you check it out.

They do not take Amex."

Golden Sakura Sushi,Japanese,"404 Wood Street Whitehorse, YT Y1A 2E8 Canada",YT,60.720558,-135.058168,2,"Came here for dinner earlier this month, during my first night in Whitehorse. The atmosphere was cozy and the service friendly, but the corners were a bit dark. The way to the washroom was not very well maintained.

We ordered a ramen, the firecracker roll and the BC salmon skin roll. The rolls tasted good and were reasonably priced, but they were poorly made. The rice was not rolled all the way around most of the rolls, causing many of them to be wackily shaped, and they disintegrated easily when picked up by my chopstick. I was honestly quite shocked at how easily they fell apart...They need to hold together as you dip them in soy sauce and then send them into your mouth...Hope the restaurant improves the roll-making."

Its been a while so I decided to take-out for the family. Wow has it gone down hill. Box A: zero teriyaki flavour on greesy chicken, rice was undercooked, dry and rubbery, and the California rolls fell apart and were stale as if they were made days ago. The wanton soup was just brown salt broth. Zero tofu and one tiny morsal of seaweed.

Beef Udon: noodle were good, beef and broth were super fatty and salty

I'm left feeling ill and like I should have ordered pizza.

I used to love sekura but won't be back again now that it has become quite terrible and not at all worth the $65 I just paid.

Sorry for the bad review as the staff were very friendly. I feel bad but I also feel slightly sick."

Although it was fresh, the food was very plain tasting.  I don't think the waitress understood my English, because it was very difficult to communicate with her, and I never received the pork fried rice I ordered.  I received plain, steamed rice instead, and it was just easier to keep it.  There was another person in my party, but our meals weren't served at the same time.  They only offered canned soda to drink, so even refills weren't free, unless you just had water.  At the register, which was being run by the same person that was our waitress, I told her we didn't get fried rice, only steamed rice.

The customer service was outstanding especially to the staff named Jose he was so welcoming and very friendly! He is very knowledgeable about the products and helped me choose the perfect food and the product was exactly what I was looking for! He went above and beyond to help me find the perfect food and the service was very quick. It made me feel at home and I left the restaurant with a smile in my face and satisfied tummy! Thank you Jose! I will keep coming back to talk to you and of-course to try out  the other food you will recommend! Jose deserves a pat on the back for a great service! Boston Pizza is lucky to have you!

Took forever to before anyone came to take our order, then my family’s food came a good 10 min before mine did, in fact we had to ask waiter where my order was. It finally came out 5 min later and was soggy and ice cold.
Not once did waiter ask if we wanted any drink refills or about dessert but was very prompt to arrive with the bill and machine in hand.
Next time we visit, we will not eat at Boston Pizza."

Fish was totally undercooked after informaing the wait staff. The cut piece of fish was just thrown back into the fryer. My vegatables were barely warm. Most of the food was uneaten.

Funny story, I ordered online for pick up for 1:20pm and set up the wrong address. Surely my mistake, I still bought another sandwich at the closer location from my work, I told them what happened but I still have to pay my food. Understandable. After I got my food, I made sure to call the other location no answer after 3 calls. I didnt even receive a call that my food is still sitting there after 5 hours. After my work, around 6pm, I went to the right location to see if possible to get a refund. The girl said no as the sandwich was built already. I said okay and left. I’ve been a manager to a fast food chain, and if I know my customers online order been sitting for more than 5 hours, I would offer a new sandwich if refund can’t be done. So probably the first and last ordering here. Good customer service helps if you want customers to come back."

The plexiglass causes an issue for hearing, especially if you have hearing issues like me, so I couldn't hear what he was saying, maybe the annoyance. Nonetheless, I was the only customer at the time, no line up behind me and plenty of time until closing. I know it's hard to find skilled, committed workers.

Sun Fortune Restaurant,Chinese,"2077 Pembina Hwy Winnipeg, MB R3T 5J9 Canada",MB,49.8149583,-97.1536379,5,"After a few days of running around getting stuff and organizing the new place, I finally got a chance to check out the new neighbourhood’s restaurants.

1st stop was the Sun Fortune Restaurant.

This restaurant has been around for many years now and was packed when we went there without a reservation. However,  the nice lady at the reception was nice enough to accommodate us.

The place was your typical nondescript Chinese restaurant - no fuss, simply decorated joint.  Prices were a little high for the small servings (smaller than I’m used to back in Calgary) but the real attractions were the amazing quality of food!

We ordered:
*** Cantonese Chow Mein - 9/10!
*** Crispy Pork Chop Topped with Dried Garlic - 9/10!
*** Deluxe Fried Rice - 9/10!
*** Deluxe Chop Suey - 7/10
*** Steamed Fish Fillet with Tofu - 10/10!😍😋
*** Beef Brisket Noodle Soup - 8/10

This place is highly recommended and will definitely be one of my go-to-places if I decided to move in the city permanently."

Protip: order the fried rice. I haven't been so excited about fried rice in awhile

They are one of the few places that do a Peking duck dinner. You need 24 hours advance notice to order it however.

Its a favorite of a lot of people.
Serving Hong Kong cafe style food.
It was popular to go there for Ying Yang (mix of hong kong style tea and coffee).
They have afternoon tea specials as well. $5.95 we did the fried rice with tomato sauce. It didn't really have much tomato but that was fine as it tasted delicious with a smoke flavor (Cantonese people call it wok hay)
We also did the lunch special which was breaded pork cutlet. $8.95
We upgraded and got spaghetti for $1.50 additional charge.

For this price it's great! If I come back soon I would upgrade to 5 stars if it stays consistent.

Parking is available in a large lot shared with other businesses."
Yujiro Japanese Restaurant,Japanese,"1822 Grant Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3N 0N3 Canada",MB,49.8567336,-97.20147,3,"Very average food (both lunch box and the roll). Pretty pricey given the quality of the food. However, the ratings for their ramen seem better than their lunch box so I might come back to try their ramen and give an updated review but for now, 3 is pretty generous tbh. Service was fast tho."
Yujiro Japanese Restaurant,Japanese,"1822 Grant Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3N 0N3 Canada",MB,49.8567336,-97.20147,4,"This place has gotten a lot busier over the years. Majority the time it’s tough to get setting for lunch. Today was my birthday. One of my best friends made reservations in advance.

Me and the company I was with dine out frequently so here’s the feedback.  Raman and it’s main ingredients, egg, pork belly, noddle texture and soup flavour all great.

Seafood Tampera was lacking some crisp. And oil didn’t taste right.

Just had uni recently from Vancouver. Even though it was supposed to be super fresh here. It is pretty hard to beat."
Yujiro Japanese Restaurant,Japanese,"1822 Grant Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3N 0N3 Canada",MB,49.8567336,-97.20147,4,"Lovely ambience, the restaurant is a cozy size with about room to seat around maybe 10 groups of four plus a bar that sits about 6 or so. Its usually very busy, so if you want to get a seat you should reserve ahead!

Presentation is very aesthetic, food is tasty and light on the stomach. It does not feel like it weighs you down. Sushi rice on the rolls is a good texture and not too sticky.

If you are able to go for ramen, its one of the better bowls you can find in the city! They only offer these at lunch though, and they are limited, so be prepared!

Price point relative to other sushi restaurants is pretty average. Quality is definitely above average, but be prepared that I think the rolls are smaller than average and you may need to order more to be full.

Otherwise a good experience!"

We got in, small restaurant outside downtown but it was clean, friendly staff. Everything we order in the menu was super good very very fresh.

I love their food and their menu. Honestly, you probably need more than 1 visit because all the items on their menu sound really good. The food is in a higher price range but I think it’s worth it. The service is fast and professional, the seating and restaurant interior design is really nice. We only had their coffee and it was tasty, will come back and try other drinks and update.

They also have underground parking which they validate on weekends, which is great, especially for downtown.

The only miss is the portion size, which is definitely on the smaller side, taking into account it is definitely on the pricier spectrum for brunch style food."

My most recent visit to this charming restaurant with a very special lady was nothing short of exceptional, thanks to the personalized menu and remarkable service that elevated our night to a whole new level.

From the moment we were greeted at the door, we were treated like royalty. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and keen to create a meal that would delight our palates and cater to our dietary restrictions. We could tell that they truly cared about curating a unique experience just for us.

We were blown away by every dish that came out and even though they looked too pretty to eat, it was like heaven on a fork. Pair that with some wonderfully curated wines and we felt lifted to a higher level of dining experience.

What really sets Deer + Almond apart is their commitment to catering to each and every guest's unique needs. Every detail, from the thoughtfully sourced ingredients to the stunning presentation of each dish, was taken care of to ensure our experience was nothing short of perfect.

Amazing service, good vibes and they topped up my coffee :) nice and warm. Everything tastes fresh and delicious. Always fresh to order. My favorite no. 1 dish always the bacon Benedict. This time my friend picked all the dishes so I didn't get the Benedict. My friend ordered the matcha latte,  it looks so pretty. The side dish potato always steal the show. So crispy...Make sure u complete your meal with their waffle or other dessert. They have amazing creative dessert.  It's a full package date at Clementine. PS: We saw the wall decor has little duck and pup hidden in the crack, how cute :) We had a great time!!"
Clementine,Cafes,"123 Princess Street Winnipeg, MB R3B 1K8 Canada",MB,49.8990129,-97.1415883,4,"Tried this place after seeing all the positive reviews.

I had the Fried Chicken on Toast which intrigued me as I typically love the waffle combination but also love sourdough. The toast was not soggy (which I was concerned about) and the chicken crispy. I prefer a thicker piece of chicken than when it is flattened down but good nonetheless. The Thom Bargen drip coffee was good.

My wife had the Brussels Style Waffle which had lemon curd, whipped cream, berries and hisbiscus syrup. There was waaaay too much whip cream which took away from the lemon curd and she didn't really notice the syrup.

It's a cute little restaurant down a flight of stairs that was nice and bright. Had to get the attention of a server to order and get refills."
Clementine,Cafes,"123 Princess Street Winnipeg, MB R3B 1K8 Canada",MB,49.8990129,-97.1415883,5,"One of the best places to go for brunch. The food is amazing, it’s flavourful, fresh, and very filling. I also love the vibe of the restaurant, it’s very cozy.

One small thing I noticed is that some of the chairs are tiny, so it may not be accessible to some people."
Clementine,Cafes,"123 Princess Street Winnipeg, MB R3B 1K8 Canada",MB,49.8990129,-97.1415883,5,"I decided to visit Clementine on my visit to Winnipeg, Manitoba. It was an amazing breakfast and brunch restaurant. One of the most famous items they have here is Fried Chicken on Toast. In fact, not only are they generally known for it, but there were people waiting in line to get into the restaurant talking about this menu item. Fried Chicken on Toast came with Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Dill Ranch, Maple Calypso, Pickles, and Sourdough Toast. The chicken was fresh, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and very nicely cooked. The flavour of the fried chicken was very unique, and absolutely delicious. It had a hint of spice and a decent amount of sweetness in the buttermilk batter which made it quite flavourful. The sourdough toast with maple calypso and dill ranch added a hint of sourness and some creaminess. The toast with maple calypso and dill ranch and the buttermilk chicken with sweetness and a hint of spice was just a fantastic combination of ingredients and flavours that made this dish absolutely outstanding! This is one of the best fried chicken dishes I’ve ever had.

I also had a side of Fried Potatoes which came with Chickpea Mayo, Bravas Sauce, and Green Onion. The potatoes were fresh and crispy and the sauces combined with the potatoes were absolutely delicious. I also enjoyed the cappuccino.

The staff were very friendly and the service was perfect. I am very happy I came to this restaurant in Winnipeg!"
Clementine,Cafes,"123 Princess Street Winnipeg, MB R3B 1K8 Canada",MB,49.8990129,-97.1415883,5,"Wonderful brunch place tucked away in the downtown area.

Ive been to Clementine multiple times and have never been disappointed. Food always tastes fresh, is thoughtfully prepared and filling enough for brunch.

My favourite dish there is the fried chicken on toast. The batter is very crunchy and contrasted with a hot honey for a sweet and savory combo that does not disappoint. Menu size is small and focused. Many of their other dishes are also very good and I cannot think of any weaknesses in the menu.

Service is always professional and friendly.

This place is very busy, they do not take reservations, so if you arrive at a busier time for brunch you will be waiting for about an hour or more, so prepare accordingly!

Would strongly recommend this restaurant and will be back!"

Well after a lovely evening with lovely people and service the bison was amazing and the people where great as well. Will be going again in the near future as the price was also good. First time having mussles and wow superb.

The food... Amazing. Not often I find a place where I can, and want to try literally everything on it.

Duck Confit was super good. Fell off the bone.

Will definitely have to come back for the perogies and the Char and.... lol"
Fusion Grill,Canadian (New),"550 Academy Road Winnipeg, MB R3N 0E3 Canada",MB,49.8741313,-97.1974105,5,"One of the best meals my wife and I have had in a long time.  Everything we had from the menu was consistently delicious.  We started with the Northern Manitoba bruschetta with wild foraged & cultured mushrooms, fresh herbs, grilled focaccia, goat's cheese, truffle oil & white wine cream, then Caesar salad with romaine, creamy roast garlic anchovy emulsion, spiced croutons & asiago cheese.  Our entrees were the Grilled Manitoba bison saddled with a blue cheese compound butter, balsamic plum gastrique, popped wild rice potato gratin & seasonable vegetables, and Ice caught pickerel with ricotta stuffed ravioli & wild mushroom whisky cream.  For dessert we had Boreal Forest Cake with Bernard Callebaut dark chocolate, freshly whipped, Saskatoon berry compote and Baked cheesecake with Chaeban mascarpone cheese topped with a changing variety of local organic preparations.  Both the food and service were incredible.  We will definitely be back!"

The food was beyond delicious! I had the Angus tenderloin from Arborg...cooked to perfection! Atmosphere was great and the service impeccable."
Fusion Grill,Canadian (New),"550 Academy Road Winnipeg, MB R3N 0E3 Canada",MB,49.8741313,-97.1974105,5,"Unbelievably tasty boutique restaurant on Academy! So tasty I went twice last week. I had the pickerel cheeks, the bison steak and apple crumble. For me to leave a restaurant full is rare but that's because a lot of food these days is filled with preservatives. This is REAL FOOD so it fills you up. The tastes are unbelievably fresh.

I've never had Juniper slaw before and now that I have, I wish it was this instead of Frank's that was on everything.

Cooked to perfection, great ambience, helpful and wonderful staff. I'll be back many times over."

The food, the ambience, the service, everything was amazing! For the antipasto, the baked brie was top notch! And my personal favourite for the entrée has to be the Agnello, which was cooked to such perfection that the meat just fell off the bone. Definitely going back for more!"
Bellissimo Restaurant & Lounge,Italian,"877 Waverley Street Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V3 Canada",MB,49.8449163,-97.1806142,5,A trendy Italian style restaurant in the south side of Winnipeg that offers great pasta dishes and deserts. Nice atmosphere with great serving and great food. I wanted the lasagna but was told it would take fifty minutes so I went with the seafood pasta instead. It was really good but I would have liked a lemon wedge and some pepper. The rest of our group loved their food. All around great experience! Add a lemon wedge and maybe some ambient music? Not enough to lose a star though. Highly recommend!
Bellissimo Restaurant & Lounge,Italian,"877 Waverley Street Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V3 Canada",MB,49.8449163,-97.1806142,5,"Very happy with this visits meal. You can have a look at my picture. To get a visual. Scalps cooked to perfection. Just the perfect amount of sauce. Rich and creamy! It’s been over a decade since my last visit here. But since my last visit, my love for pasta has grown significantly. If I like this meal, you will also appreciate this meal"
Bellissimo Restaurant & Lounge,Italian,"877 Waverley Street Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V3 Canada",MB,49.8449163,-97.1806142,4,"We had a great time at Bellissimo. Everything was great from the appetizers, entrée and desserts. We enjoyed the Aragosta the most. I had a cappuccino after my meal though not gonna lie but I was expecting coffee art on my cup as it was a bit overpriced."
Bellissimo Restaurant & Lounge,Italian,"877 Waverley Street Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V3 Canada",MB,49.8449163,-97.1806142,3,"The food was ok. Was a little disappointed with the sauce that accompanied my chicken, or lack thereof. The peacan crusted chicken was amazing. My sister had the special which was a lobster carbonara, had only a cpl pieces of lobster, the noodles were very chewy and when you are paying $$$ for a plate you expect the quality and quantity to come with it. The place was beautiful, the atmosphere was simple and elegant. The staff were outstanding. Very attentive and humorous. Everyone was having a good time. I would give this place another chance."
Sous Sol,French,"222 Osborne Street Unit 22 Winnipeg, MB R3L 1Z3 Canada",MB,49.8756135,-97.1423302,5,We loved where we were seated. A cozy nook and it was such a romantic date spot. The food was very good. Our favourite dish was the potatoes dauphinoise. Our food was a little slow to come out that evening and they apologized and brought us some free drinks. We hadn't even noticed it was slow as we were just enjoying the relaxed pace. Will definitely return!
Sous Sol,French,"222 Osborne Street Unit 22 Winnipeg, MB R3L 1Z3 Canada",MB,49.8756135,-97.1423302,5,The atmosphere and just the whole experience of this place is a must. Our server was very nice and very attentive with us thru out our whole time there. Food was plated really nicely and everything tasted real good. The potatoes are a must!! Definitely coming back here in summer with our pupper ☺️☺️
Sous Sol,French,"222 Osborne Street Unit 22 Winnipeg, MB R3L 1Z3 Canada",MB,49.8756135,-97.1423302,4,"Sous Sol has a really unique vibe (i.e: candles on the tables, decorations, furniture). The servers were friendly but nothing exceptional about the services. They will not check on you or your food after the food came or explain/make suggestions on the menu. We ordered quite a bit of different dishes but the highlight turned out to be the bread and butter. All the appetizers were decent, and the dessert was good. However, we were pretty disappointed with the main since they were too salty. The tenderloin was really juicy/tender/high quality but it was just too salty. However, given this amount of food/drink and the quality of their ingredients, the price is pretty good especially compared to other steakhouses in town (main reasons I gave 4 stars). I don’t think we will come back, but it’s good to try it out at least once. Our bill was about 200$/2person."
Sous Sol,French,"222 Osborne Street Unit 22 Winnipeg, MB R3L 1Z3 Canada",MB,49.8756135,-97.1423302,5,Love coming here every time!

It's perfectly weird, but in a way that makes you feel comfortable, not uncool.
Everything was incredible. The food and drinks were amaze-balls but the biggest highlight was the service. The main person that took care of us was incredibly knowledgeable and attentive, but other staff members seamless stepped in to run food, refill drinks, and run payments. I love a good restaurant, but I don't know if I've ever had a better dining experience.
I can't wait to come back."
Asian Hot Pot,Hot Pot,"740 Corydon Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M 0W6 Canada",MB,49.870554,-97.1529167,3,"Their soup based tastes really flavourful and delicious. We had fun mixing in different sauces to come up with flavours that our tastebuds would love. Prices were a bit much. Paid $90 for two people. Not worth the price we paid.

Service 3/5  |   Food 4/5   |   Atmosphere 3/5"
Asian Hot Pot,Hot Pot,"740 Corydon Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M 0W6 Canada",MB,49.870554,-97.1529167,3,"We went there on Sunday night and it’s pretty busy. Decided to try this place simply because of the individual hot pot. You can mix you own sauces, which was really fun and everyone was meant to get their own broth,so that’s an additional cost on top of the AYCE price.Also the price not included any drinks and the broths didn’t have that much taste. The choices not as wide as some other hot pot places I have been to."
Asian Hot Pot,Hot Pot,"740 Corydon Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M 0W6 Canada",MB,49.870554,-97.1529167,4,"hidden spot in winnipeg, definitely give it a try if you’re interested in asian cuisine, on another note go for lunch, it’ll be half the price. 80$ for two people… wasn’t expected and was hidden on the menu. service was 3.5/5, price was 3/5 but keep an open mind because 5/5 food. make sure not to over boil but meats boil for about 15 seconds and vegetables 30. it was absolutely delicious and i loved being able to cook it myself. it was cozy inside but another table made my stay less enjoyable as they were very noisy and provocative. overall definitely worth trying and i will be going back for the lunch specials."
Asian Hot Pot,Hot Pot,"740 Corydon Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M 0W6 Canada",MB,49.870554,-97.1529167,1,"Nice idea poorly executed. Food is decent , service bad . Watch what you're ordering and check your receipt,  very misleading.  Not a place I would return for a meal ."
Asian Hot Pot,Hot Pot,"740 Corydon Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M 0W6 Canada",MB,49.870554,-97.1529167,5,"Absolutely fabulous place if you like soup! Good selection of broths from mild to spicy.

The Merchant Kitchen,Cocktail Bars,"314 Donald Street Winnipeg, MB R3B 2B9 Canada",MB,49.8943208,-97.1442907,4,"Scallops are delicious. I highly recommend them.
But the noodles were hard and a little raw.
The lemongrass tart has lavender flowers on it, which is very unique. Cocktails are refreshing."
The Merchant Kitchen,Cocktail Bars,"314 Donald Street Winnipeg, MB R3B 2B9 Canada",MB,49.8943208,-97.1442907,4,"The food was good, we had wings which were delicious. We also tried the fried rice, the noodles and the tacos. Everything was good, the tacos are a bit expensive for the quantity but it was good. We also tried chocolat tart and lime tart, both were delicious. The wine is super expensive , good cocktails a bit expensive too. Overall a good experience.
But the place is very noisy which makes it hard to have a discussion with everyone at the table.
100 bucks for 1 cocktail, 1 beer, 1 glass 6oz wine, noodles, tacos and 1 dessert, is a bir pricey ( price for 2 ).
I'd still recommand, not sure I would go back because of the noise."
The Merchant Kitchen,Cocktail Bars,"314 Donald Street Winnipeg, MB R3B 2B9 Canada",MB,49.8943208,-97.1442907,5,We had a great time in the restaurant. There are different dishes and drinks on the menu that are inspired by Latin American countries. The Chajá dessert was amazing. Great service and quick.

The Merchant Kitchen,Cocktail Bars,"314 Donald Street Winnipeg, MB R3B 2B9 Canada",MB,49.8943208,-97.1442907,3,Heard great things about this restaurant but found it to be somewhat average. Corn with nachos tasted like canned corn with some cheese on top. Korean chicken was basic fried chicken and nothing more. Dandan noodles were good again but nothing special except sauce was tasty. After hearing good reviews I was disappointed and found it pricey for what you received. Pleasant service
Marion Street Eatery,Canadian (New),"393 Marion Street Winnipeg, MB R2H Canada",MB,49.8821763,-97.1090184,5,"Not knowing anything about this place was hesitant at first going to this eatery inside a hotel/casino but so glad we did.

This restaurant is nicely decorated and spacious which is a contrast from the hotel lobby we came through. The staff was very friendly and attentive to our kids. There is a nice kids menu.

All our dishes were excellent not a single complain. They were well done and very flavorful. We will definitely come back."
Marion Street Eatery,Canadian (New),"393 Marion Street Winnipeg, MB R2H Canada",MB,49.8821763,-97.1090184,5,"Marion might be the most delicious breakfast- brunch place in Canada. Waiters are friendly and kind, portions are more than fair and the food is just perfect every single time. Nowhere else you can get a well-served, tasty salad with pistachios sufficient for two with less than $20. Sweet potato fries are always fresh and perfectly crunchy. Their iced latte has no competition. Don't forget to order their weekly dessert special every time... I just wish they stayed forever in the menu."
Marion Street Eatery,Canadian (New),"393 Marion Street Winnipeg, MB R2H Canada",MB,49.8821763,-97.1090184,3,"Overall decent. I was so excited abt the mini pancake such a good idea, the cream wasn't airy and a bit bland, apple was crunchy like hard. It wasn't caramelized or cooked. Biscuit was good with nice texture but also bland. I think everything cooked well but missing flavor from herbs, garlic, shallots, pesto hit a hot pan & oil that kind of flavor. So overall cooked well but bland..Just something missing. Good menu and has potential. Nice place and service was pretty quick."
Marion Street Eatery,Canadian (New),"393 Marion Street Winnipeg, MB R2H Canada",MB,49.8821763,-97.1090184,5,"The food was excellent and I was happy to see that they use high quality ingredients from a local bakery (Tall Grass Prairie) and dairy (Cheaban). I had the overnight oats and the dish was an easy competitor for the best oatmeal I have ever had.

The staff was friendly, efficient and helpful.  We sat at the counter and my coffee never made it to half empty before being topped up.

Ample parking out back."

BMC Market,Mexican,"722 Osborne Street Winnipeg, MB R3L Canada",MB,49.8616832,-97.1313232,5,I was extremely satisfied with these tacos!🌮🌮🌮 The tacos were a bit on the small side but they were also quite inexpensive. They are authentic Mexican not Tex-Mex (if that matters to you). I would most definitely go here again and would recommend it to everyone I know. The staff was friendly and service was quick. The closest thing I have to a complaint is the tacos were drippy (but I think that's better than them being too dry)
BMC Market,Mexican,"722 Osborne Street Winnipeg, MB R3L Canada",MB,49.8616832,-97.1313232,5,"I have gone here throughout the years and the restaurant has maintained making their tacos with homemade tortillas, great flavors, and low-pricing. I personally love the chorizo sausage and al pastor tacos. Service has always been fast and friendly."
BMC Market,Mexican,"722 Osborne Street Winnipeg, MB R3L Canada",MB,49.8616832,-97.1313232,2,I came here 3x and loved it. We’d order 5 kinds of tacos as well as Hibiscus drinks. Recently they upped the prices of everything by a LOT (I understand a slight increase…but they still use paper plates) Sadly don’t think I will go back unless I am desperate craving it 💔
BMC Market,Mexican,"722 Osborne Street Winnipeg, MB R3L Canada",MB,49.8616832,-97.1313232,5,"Great Mexican restaurant.  Very authentic!!! When you see grandma in the kitchen,  you know the food will be 🤌🏾🤌🏾."

Pho Hoang,Vietnamese,"794 Sargent Avenue Suite 5 Winnipeg, MB R3E 0B7 Canada",MB,49.8965239,-97.1677904,5,"This place is amazing for pho and anything else on the menu really.

Portions are massive compared to a lot of places I’ve tried prior.

Amazing service, they’re very quick with lots of staff and even with the restaurant full they don’t neglect tables.

At around 15$ per bowl it’s really worth the price.

Restaurant is clean and besides the urinal
being out of service I had no complaints.

Would 100% eat here again."

I pick this one as it's nearby, good review ,  good parking and lots of reviews. I must say for such a small town it had an Excellent selection and the pho was pretty good. The soup tasted like it's been simmering all day. I got the combination with extra meat plus a Vietnamese coffee which was freshly made on the table. Definitely recommended and would go back for a quick bite. The bowl was about $11.00."
Pho Hoang,Vietnamese,"794 Sargent Avenue Suite 5 Winnipeg, MB R3E 0B7 Canada",MB,49.8965239,-97.1677904,5,"Love this place! They can definitely use better systems for ordering and seating but the food is excellent! Traditional pho without MSG (or so they tell me, the lady at the front didn’t know, but the cook said no) good size and priced right:)

The place is busy for lunch, looks like everything is fresh and they are friendly. I’d return for sure! Hopefully they can figure out how to organize the chaos by then. Thank you again!"

Awesome meals with generous portions, quick service, decent prices and they make substitutions with no fuss.  Made fresh and not spicy - provide hot sauce on the side if ask.

I had the special of the day of shrimp and veg with wine sauce and a side of fettuccine Alfredo (Alfredo is always on point here) husband ordered lamb shank (so tender and succulent) and kids got gnocchi so creamy and always their order when we are in. For apps we had meatballs (moist and tender), calamari so tender and fresh and an order of focaccia which they make in house.
For dessert we did gelato (hazelnut, lemon and strawberry) all were delicious and I had tiramisu which was surprisingly light and airy yet creamy and decadent. Service was great and fast as always. Always love having family nights here!"

Tre Visi Cafe,Italian,"926 Grosvenor Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M 2W9 Canada",MB,49.8704604,-97.1630418,5,Small restaurant on Stafford with 6-7 tables we had olives for appetizer and pasta. They were very flexible with changing the type of pasta from ribbon to spaghetti. Food was very good and lots of flavor and huge portions. Most of the pasta on the menu will come with half portion and full portion options. Half portion was still plenty of food for me - if you are indecisive and want to try out couple different pasta doing half portion would be a great idea. Most things on the menu can be done gluten free too.
Tre Visi Cafe,Italian,"926 Grosvenor Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M 2W9 Canada",MB,49.8704604,-97.1630418,5,"Excellent as always. I've been here 3 times and have enjoyed the food every time.

Vera,Pizza,"670 Osborne Street Winnipeg, MB R3L 2B9 Canada",MB,49.8626329,-97.1321393,4,"Delicious pizza. The salad was also reaaaally good. Friendly service. It’s a bit small and if all tables are occupied it’s extremely loud. Dough was a bit undercooked in the middle. There is an upper level, may be quieter."
Vera,Pizza,"670 Osborne Street Winnipeg, MB R3L 2B9 Canada",MB,49.8626329,-97.1321393,5,"There is a lot of street parking all around this restaurant.
This restaurant has a few tables and can be tricky getting a table. It is so worth the effort to get a table!
The pizzas are great, the dough/crust is thin light and chewy. The cheese was flavourful and tasty. Overall I found these pizzas pretty close to what I got in northern Italy.
The staff is wonderful they really made our visit great.
Definitely go and eat in."
Vera,Pizza,"670 Osborne Street Winnipeg, MB R3L 2B9 Canada",MB,49.8626329,-97.1321393,4,"I heard that this place can have lines down the street so we had to give it a try. Luckily it wasn't too busy, and we were even able to sit on the patio. Service was quick and we got the food quickly too. I'm a believer that the crust makes the pizza, and the crust is crispy on the outside and has a nice chewy texture as well. The ingredients tasted fresh. Not a heavy pizza, which is always good."
Vera,Pizza,"670 Osborne Street Winnipeg, MB R3L 2B9 Canada",MB,49.8626329,-97.1321393,5,"I have been going to Vera for several years now and it never fails to disappoint. Fantastic pizza, lovely atmosphere and a cute small patio in the summer. Definitely one of my go to pizza places."

Nicely portioned meals pleasing anyone with an appetite for the Italian flare. The specials are indeed special but don’t shy away from the traditional pizza- wood fired (dining mate really enjoyed it as it looked great as well). Don’t forget to have a dessert- the tarts were packed with flavour.
Bonfire Bistro,Italian,"1433 Corydon Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3N 0J2 Canada",MB,49.8635921,-97.1851188,5,Bonfire bistro has amazing pizza and pasta.  I highly recommend.  We needed a reservation on a Monday to get in! I am glad we did because the atmosphere is lovely.  All in all I give this place a full star review and will recommend to everyone I meet. Only down side is the tables are a bit small. But we managed three people at a table so it worked out.

Desserts are well done and very tasty. (Photos included) the place looks very clean and quite. Staff are also friendly and very helpful."
Bonfire Bistro,Italian,"1433 Corydon Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3N 0J2 Canada",MB,49.8635921,-97.1851188,5,"Not a high-end restaurant, but the variety of food choices was very good and the wine selection limited but well chosen for any wine pallette. We enjoyed the pizza as well as a couple of other entrees. It was a nice environment and pleasant service.  Most importantly is that we'd go back again."

Fringe festival was going on on the other street, the atmosphere was amazing !"
Peasant Cookery,French,"283 Bannatyne Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3B 1M3 Canada",MB,49.8984842,-97.1412977,5,"Day 12 of my pre birthday celebrations and  in pursuit of discovering the new (possible) home city’s food.  Today  has been the best meal we’ve had so far.

This restaurant is in the historic Exchange District of YWG and housed  in one of the many turn-of-the-century beautifully preserved masonry structures in one of Canada’s designated historic sites.

The mode was casual and the ambiance had this quirky old world charm.

Service was outstanding! 10/10!

We ordered:
Starters:
*CHICKEN LIVERS. $19
Pan-fried with brandy peppercorn sauce, baguette toast. I hate liver but I loved the rich flavours of the sauce. WOWZA and YUMZA! The president said the livers had this amazing flavour profile and had beautiful texture. He finished the entire dish. 10/10!
* PORK DRY RIBS. $16
Baby back ribs braised then fried until crisp, with chili and lime. The ribs was soft but not fall-off-the-bone so they were just  perfect. The caramelized crust added more flavours and texture to these delectable bites. WOWZA and YUMZA! 10/10!
Mains:
*HOUSE SAUSAGE MEATBALL PAPPARDELLE. $28
Smoked tomato and pepper cream sauce, garlic, onions, arugula and chêvre cheese. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce was a real winner. The meatballs were just ok. 8/10!
*PORK CHOP. $36
Roasted root vegetables, green beans, pickled apples and grainy mustard jus. The chop was pure perfection. So tender, juicy and just packed with incredible flavours. The mustard  jus elevated the sensational texture and flavours to another level. WOWZA and YUMZA 20/10!!! 🔥😍😋😱💕

A remarkable culinary experience for sure."
Peasant Cookery,French,"283 Bannatyne Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3B 1M3 Canada",MB,49.8984842,-97.1412977,5,"We come here often for buck a shuck on Wednesday night! Sometimes for dinner but usually late night after kids activities. Great spot to unwind and have a few drinks and snacks! We had oysters, a cheese plate (which they always have an amazing selection) desserts and drinks. My husband always try’s all the beer they have on selection and I always get a glass of red which is reasonably priced at $14 for a 9oz and heavy pour at times! Great friendly service and food comes out fast. Ambiance is dimmed and great spot for conversations and good times!
Make sure to make a reservation for Wednesday’s as its always packed."
Peasant Cookery,French,"283 Bannatyne Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3B 1M3 Canada",MB,49.8984842,-97.1412977,4,"Peasant Cookery is a delightful spot for charcuterie, oysters on the half shell, and classic French favorites.

The food is all presented beautifully, but only giving 4 stats as the French onion soup and gravy on the steak frites was very sweet. Sweet beyond normal French onion soup level of sweet.

On the other hand, the chicken liver paté with pickles and grainy mustard was out of this world, as was the escargot on puff pastry.

And, as it was Wednesday, it was buck-a-shuck oysters - well worth the visit.

The steak was cooked as requested, but the volume of fries was overwhelming - almost couldn't see the steak!

I'm sure if we go back it would be a 5 star experience. Service was great and interior is atmospheric."

The atmosphere is very welcoming and chic. Service was top-notch. Definitely not a cheap place to go out to eat at, but well worth the price!"
Harth Mozza & Wine Bar,Italian,"980 St Anne's Road Winnipeg, MB R2M 2X9 Canada",MB,49.818728,-97.0813004,5,"Harth is… a gem. We’re so fortunate to live so close, it’s incredible every time.

We got the family style for my wife’s birthday last Tuesday and loved every bite.

There was a nice variety of items and they totally changed the menu since our last visit.

One minor critique, our break could have been a bit more hot and toasty.

We will be back, time and time again and continue to suggest and recommend Harth to our friends and family.

We hope you enjoy it as much as we do!

Harth Mozza & Wine Bar,Italian,"980 St Anne's Road Winnipeg, MB R2M 2X9 Canada",MB,49.818728,-97.0813004,5,"Oh god I don't know where to start! One of the first things the server said to us was ""if you don't know something on the menu, don't google it, ask me. Let me serve you"". That left us an extremely impeccable first impression. Everything we had here was incredibly delicious and of high quality ingredients. The service, the presentation, the space, the vibe, the decoration,... Top notch! Harth is easily one of the finest restaurants in the prairie region of Canada (and I have been to and eaten at a lot of restaurants in all of the big cities - Regina/ Saskatoon/ Calgary/ Edmonton/ Winnipeg). Totally worth the drive all the way from Regina. 6 stars!"
Harth Mozza & Wine Bar,Italian,"980 St Anne's Road Winnipeg, MB R2M 2X9 Canada",MB,49.818728,-97.0813004,5,Truly a romantic and amazing place. The pizza bar is perfect for a date because you can impress your date by pretending to know what the chef is doing when explaining make up cooking techniques to her. I also pretended to know my wine. I ordered white by mistake when my date asked for a recommendation for red. But this place is so nice with perfect ambience she forgave me and thought it was funny instead. Just make sure you book ahead cause that place is packed even on a Tuesday night.
Harth Mozza & Wine Bar,Italian,"980 St Anne's Road Winnipeg, MB R2M 2X9 Canada",MB,49.818728,-97.0813004,4,"Celebrated our anniversary and booked a table for dinner, its our first time here and read a lot of food things on the reviews so we already know what we wanted to try out. Started out with a glass of Chianti and Prosecco and a Margherita pizza which had wonderful crust and rich cheese, lack a bit more of the basil flavor but still very good; lamb shank was good, succulent and flavorful; our favorite was the Tagliatelle which is a must have in my opinion! The pasta is perfect and the sauce is well balanced both savory and creamy and the delicious duck 😋 To end the meal we ordered the lemon curd but it took sometime before it was served so to apologize they just charged it on the house. We are already planning when to come back to try out the other dishes! Highly recommend this place 🥂"

The server managed to understand our vegetarian needs and directed towards the best options.

Definitely worth exploring !!!"

Veggies, lamb, pork , beef , chicken, seafood.  The staff are very helpful and knowledgeable.  It was a fun time, and 2 hours flew by.  We will be for the supper menu next time, I think. We also had the peach flavored soju.  It was a great experience."

Normally I do a pros and cons list but no real cons. Delicious food, cool experience, very nice staff. More meat that I thought we could eat and it was all delicious. I guess the only cons is for people that don’t want to cook their meat themselves (but there’s a good list of sushi and other items anyway). Highly recommend, make sure to visit in an empty stomach!"

First time. Incredible experience and good way to try new food.
Staff is the best I've ever seen and very very friendly.   Expensive, but worth it.

Best in a group, but wow... Just wow."
IGI BBQ and Sushi Bistro,Sushi Bars,"10-1875 Pembina Highway Winnipeg, MB R3T 2G6 Canada",MB,49.8217704,-97.1546952,2,"Unfortunately I have to say all in all I’m disappointed with our experience.  The restaurant (right now at least) is reservations only.  I booked 2 weeks ahead of time and still didn’t get the desired dining time I wanted.
We got there and the place was packed and loud so if you want to have a conversation with someone, good luck.  Not a romantic couples date spot in the least.
We were seated and waited an awfully long time for someone to come to our table, keep in mind there’s a pretty strict 2 hour time limit in place here, your times are even scribbled on your order sheet as reference.  We finally had a server come and explain how the menu works after we explained it’s our first visit.  We ordered and waited a long time again to get our food delivered.  To the point that we were getting annoyed because several tables that arrived after us were getting heaps of food delivered and well into their meals.  Food finally came and honestly at the steep $40.95 per person price tag, it wasn’t worth it.  You can see from past reviews and my pictures that the price has literally skyrocketed.
They offer no guidance on cooking, you just toss things on your in table bbq and hope for the best.  I’d suggest skipping the sushi because it’s sloppy and just mediocre.  A lot of rice and seaweed and not much else.  So the sushi was a big disappointment.
The beer price tag was a bit of a shock too, at $10 for a single pint.
The bathrooms are pretty run down and gross.  Doors don’t latch and the toilet didn’t flush.  Our server was nice enough, not outstanding service or anything, just adequate.
The parking lot is atrocious with huge severe bumps and holes.  The parking spaces are a joke, so tiny, you can barely get in and out of your vehicle.
Overall I’m glad to have given this restaurant a shot but I was not wowed and am not in a rush to return."
East India Company Pub & Eatery,Indian,"349 York Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3C 3S9 Canada",MB,49.8887807,-97.1432601,5,"This restaurant has so much history that it could be a museum. It was Winnipeg's first Indian restaurant in 1967 and from the moment you enter to this beautiful place, you can see a bunch of wooden sculptures which we were told were even 200 years old, probably more. The decoration alone is an amazing reason to come, but as if that was not enough, the food is just as good!
We tried to try everything from the bufette and no single dish disappointed us, there are many vegetarian and non vegetarian options for every taste. We were particular fans of the shrimp curry but every dish is worth trying.
The staff is amazingly friendly and attentive and take care of you really well.
This is a must visit place in Winnipeg!"
East India Company Pub & Eatery,Indian,"349 York Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3C 3S9 Canada",MB,49.8887807,-97.1432601,3,"First time back in 3 years. Came in for a Sunday lunch. It’s $24.99 per person. We missed the food and interior. The food was basic. Use to be the best Indian restaurant and now just the average. Stand outs were salad bat and the basic mayo pasta salad. The samosa had good flavor, tandoori chicken was better than other offerings, and the eggplant dish. Things that weren’t great were butter chicken, palak paneer (no paneer) and the shrimp with creamy curry"
East India Company Pub & Eatery,Indian,"349 York Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3C 3S9 Canada",MB,49.8887807,-97.1432601,5,"Drive your car, fly your plane, sail your boat up the Red River! I don't care how you do it...drop everything and come eat here. Friendly staff, brilliant atmosphere, incredible food awaits! Order off the menu or sample a massive buffet option for under $30. And that buffet! So many options that the average human being simply cannot taste every offering without causing massive gastrointestinal trauma. It's just that good!

Seriously, this place is a hidden gem in Winnipeg's downtown. Get a Kingfisher, grab a plate and enjoy some of the best food you'll ever taste. Then tip the serving staff very well because they've done an incredible job taking care of you! 5* all around!"

East India Company Pub & Eatery,Indian,"349 York Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3C 3S9 Canada",MB,49.8887807,-97.1432601,4,"Went on a Tuesday evening and it wasn’t too busy. There’s a large selection of East Indian food to try as it is a buffet style restaurant. I wasn’t familiar with East Indian food so I just tried a bunch of different things. It works out because you find out what you like and what you don’t like.

There are both vegan and meat options which are labeled accordingly which is helpful. To end the meal, there are yummy desert options. There was ice cream, jello and mousse among other things. The orange swirl ice cream and mango mousse were really good.

Indoor decor is pretty unique and interesting. Water service is very fast. Staff is pretty nice other than the odd looks some of them were giving, not too sure why. Despite the downtown location, there’s FREE convenient parking right across the street with dedicated spots."

Well, the portion for appetizer and dessert is so small but the main food was awesome. I brought his Birthday cake over there and asked them to bring it after dinner and they surprised me with sparkles and my boyfriend  was so happy. Their staff are friendly."
Cafe Dario,Latin American,"1390 Erin Street Winnipeg, MB R3E 2S8 Canada",MB,49.9009183,-97.1840769,4,"A completely mellow atmosphere at lunch on a Thursday in late May.  Be aware, the outdoor patio can get warm, but it's a very nice space that continues the decor of the interior. We had the good fortune to have had Dario himself waiting today, so the interactions were lively and very engaging.  He is a master of the light hearted tease. The food as always was a fusion of flavors that meld into a most enjoyable gastronomic experience.  The spicy pork tenderloin with mango, lives up to it's spicy name, but is well worth a try. The presentation is whimsical, as always. Without question a reliable place to find delicious fare."
Cafe Dario,Latin American,"1390 Erin Street Winnipeg, MB R3E 2S8 Canada",MB,49.9009183,-97.1840769,3,"Good service and good food

My appetiser escargot Diabolo was awesome, the spring rolls were delicious, the soup a five spice Asian beef soup was just ok my bowl had very little beef while my friends had chunks of beef.

The salad of mixed greens and berry vinegarete was delicious!

I chose the rack of lamb for my entrée, while it tasted fabulous the portion was extremely small. Friend ordered the chicken and she loved every bite. The mashed potatoes were excellent

Dessert was great however small

Overall it was. Good experience may or may not be back will have to see what the menu has at the time."
Cafe Dario,Latin American,"1390 Erin Street Winnipeg, MB R3E 2S8 Canada",MB,49.9009183,-97.1840769,5,"I got the cheapest off the lunch menu thinking it might be subpar... I couldn't be more wrong! This stuffed chicken breast is absolutely fantastic. Might be too much to say this dish is life changing, but it is fair to say this is the best chicken breast dish I ever tasted! Found this place because of my gluten intolerant friend, and while it sounded wrong, today I thank him for that.
Second picture entrees is a beef tenderloin, so good!"
Cafe Dario,Latin American,"1390 Erin Street Winnipeg, MB R3E 2S8 Canada",MB,49.9009183,-97.1840769,5,"What a great restaurant! Dishes are presented beautifully and are flavourful.  The chef (Dario) comes out of the kitchen and explains dishes or just has fun with his guests.

I highly recommend this spot."
Santa Ana Pizzeria & Bistro,Pizza,"1631 St. Mary's Road Unit F Winnipeg, MB R2N 1Z4 Canada",MB,49.8197103,-97.111791,5,"This restaurant is in a strip mall but don't let the ordinary facade trick into thinking this is an ordinary pizza joint.

Located in the strip mall there is eay more parking than ever could be used. However there is a limited amount of seating inside so it would be prudent to reserve well ahead of the date you want.

Friendly staff sat us quickly.  They have comfortable seats in a lovely atmosphere.  They have decent sized menu  starters, pasta, pizzas and salads etc.

They had 11"" wood fired pizza and 15"" stone baked pizza, which we could have had thin crust or the regular (we chose the regular).

Both pizzas were cooked right, neither being doughy/undercooked nor charred/hard and dry.  Our loaded pizzas were just right.

The regular crust on the 15"" was awesome. The crust wasn't greasy. The crust light and airy. It was cooked but neither doughy or tough. Even the edges didn't get hard or crusty, just the right amount of chew.

The wood fired 11"" was very good, the dough handled the toppings without getting soggy and the crust wasn't burned or dried out.

The quality of the toppings were very tasty and the pizzas were very filling. Everything we saw that came out of the kitchen looked really tasty.

Don't let the exterior fool you, this is one great restaurant.
We will be back."

Its a very small restaurant - so it fills up fast.  Best to call ahead by 1-3 weeks and make a reservation if you want a specific date for your outing.  We had an 11 inch woodfired pizza called the Roman.  It had prosciutto, roma tomatoes, green olives and asiago.  We also ordered a 15 inch Stone Baked Pizza - designed our own with pancetta, black olives, pineapple and cheddar and mozzarella cheeses.  Both were excellent.  Lots of choices on the menu for pizza lovers.  They also had starters, pasta, and salad on their menu - though we didn't try any this time.  Decent wine menu was available as well.  The decor was quite nice - thought the table lights inside the bottles were interesting and worked well.  Our server was friendly and took care of us very well.   Takeout is available.  Saw that they offer vegan and gluten free crusts as well.  We will certainly go to this restaurant again to try more of their menu - this was our first time there."

Asked that I pick, looked at their menu online and decided on their Philadelphia Pizza; wood fired steak, mushroom, onion, garlic, cheddar & Pesto Pizza; chicken breast, roasted red pepper, asiago, basil pesto.
We picked them up ourselves so as to make sure that the profit goes only to the restaurant and not to a delivery service.
They looked amazing! The crust was crisp and chewy. They do not shy away on toppings, each piece was a meal. Soo hearty, flavorful and downright delicious!
Going to visit my cousins again before new years and hope order from them again while in town."
Santa Ana Pizzeria & Bistro,Pizza,"1631 St. Mary's Road Unit F Winnipeg, MB R2N 1Z4 Canada",MB,49.8197103,-97.111791,2,"Was very put off by this place last time I picked up my order. The pizza is fine, but not worth the money (in my opinion). I'm mostly writing a critical review because the service I received was awful. I wasn't greeted when I came in. Instead, I was ignored and the couple that came in AFTER me, was helped. When I finally was helped, the lady was unfriendly and had no interest in helping me. Customer service goes a long way, so I don't plan on returning."

The Oval Room has been refurbished to keep its integrity and it looks great. The food was spot on, and the delivery of appetizers and entrees was perfectly timed. The price is on the high end but if you are looking for a special evening this could be the place. I recommend reservations."
The Palm Room,Cocktail Bars,"222 Broadway Winnipeg, MB R3C 0R3 Canada",MB,49.8879884,-97.1367387,5,"Beautiful, elevated, cocktail and dinning experience at the Oval Room Brasserie located in the Hotel Fort Garry. Stopped in for impromptu cocktails (Yuk Yuk’s Comedy Club in Lowell level) and small bites. We didn’t have a reservation but were easily and amusingly accommodated by the lovely hostess.
Ambiance is of fine French decor. Elegant and vey comfortable. Cocktail book was extensive; you’d be hard pressed to not find something of your liking. This gin aficionado tried truffle gin and it was fantastic. Who knew?! Thoughtfully curated cocktail menu and dinning menu. Service was excellent, witty and entertaining.
Pickerel bites and mussels were well seasoned and delicious. Both prepared well. I have not had a terrible meal at the Fort Garry EVER. Should be on your dinning and cocktail list in Winnipeg."

The burger on take out a while back was great, and the manager Pauline helped me out tremendously although the dining room was full. I was so thankful.
However, the meatloaf I had today was awesome, actually the whole experience was elevated maybe not so much by the meatloaf, great taste, but more of the atmosphere and the people that worked there. I was greeted by Fran, a very pleasant person and a great server. She said she would look after me, and boy, did she! Not only did she put me in her favorite spot (ask her why that is), her recommendations were on point, everything from the margarita to the dessert, and who will ever forget the meatloaf wine combo?! Everything was absolutely wonderful.
Would I recommend this place? You bet! And I will be back, for sure!"

The architecture is like no other restaurant in Winnipeg and there are no words to fully express my admiration of the atmosphere at Oval Room. The prices of the dishes were on the high side—to be expected. The mains are a la carte, and sides were pricy too. Regardless, the food was quite tasty and the gnocchi dish left me feeling full.  Service was kind and fast, a little rushed, but satisfactory. This restaurant is definitely a special occasion spot and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a very special date night out."

The food and drinks were also amazing!  What stood out to us was the exceptional service by our server Fran.  She was very personable and helpful all around.

Later on in the evening, we returned for cocktails.  While on her break, despite not being our server, Fran checked up on us.  This level of service and personability is very rarely seen.

Yes the food and drinks were great but it's hands down due to the service that I would recommend the Oval Room Brasserie."

The plates are meant to be share so for a party of two we were recommended to get 4 dishes. Reservation at this place is pretty much a must for dinner as the place only hosts a handful of tables.

The food was pretty great but you must be open to enjoying more interesting flavors."

We got the beets, pork bellly and beef cheek, but I could have tried the whole menu. My husband and I were surprised at first at the presentation but a few bites in and we were amazed. Don’t be fooled you will leave happy, content and full. The foods flavours seriously blew us away, brining me back to my moms cooking, nostalgia is one thing a that not many people nail, but this was an experience we will remember for years to come. All this combined with a unique but incredible beer and wine list, and last but not least our server was nothing but but high class, efficient, and awonderful conversationalist. Highly reccomend to anyone coming to Winnipeg. If I could give 6 stars I would. Come here get that pork belly and never look back. 🤤🤤🤤"

Ichiban Japanese Steakhouse,Japanese,"189 Carlton St Winnipeg, MB R3C 3H7 Canada",MB,49.889776,-97.144192,5,"I haven't gone out since December so this was pretty scary of an experience, but the atmosphere was so amazing that I felt entirely at ease. The prices are worth it for the quality of service and interactive experience alone, but the deal is sweetened by the large amount of food you get and the fact that it's seafood cooked literally perfectly. I don't think I've ever had scallops that were cooked to a perfect texture before I came here.
The hosts are super friendly and attentive and the cooks are all equally friendly and a whole lot of fun. The cook at our table was able to fit right into our group's sense of humor and it was like just adding another friend to the table.
I also absolutely LOVE the Geisha drink I got. Not only was it super tasty, but the glass was beautiful and I got to take it home. I want to come back to collect them all, especially the Lucky Cat.
Thank you for the lovely food, service and experience!"
Ichiban Japanese Steakhouse,Japanese,"189 Carlton St Winnipeg, MB R3C 3H7 Canada",MB,49.889776,-97.144192,4,"Fun experience and yummy food. A little expensive, but you do get a ton of food. Only a few different meal options. Great place if you enjoy meat as you get chicken, steak, and then your choice of shrimp and giant scallops, or lobster. Warning, the comedy doesn’t change much as the jokes were all pretty much the same as my previous visit 12 years ago."
The Grove Pub & Restaurant,British,"164 Stafford St Winnipeg, MB R3M 2V8 Canada",MB,49.8707268,-97.1632326,5,"One of my fave local spots. They have a fantastic bar, craft beer, attentive and friendly staff, and the food always works—there’s a little something for any mood."

Will be back as I’m already craving that gravy! Friendly staff, clean… an all around nice spot."
The Grove Pub & Restaurant,British,"164 Stafford St Winnipeg, MB R3M 2V8 Canada",MB,49.8707268,-97.1632326,5,"The food and service were excellent. I had the burger w half Ceasar salad half fries. Both sides were excellent and the burger was delicious. Generous servings, excellent quality, great prices. We arrived for lunch early at 1130 and this seems like a good idea as it really filled up at lunch time. Even when it was very busy the wait staff were very present and friendly."
The Grove Pub & Restaurant,British,"164 Stafford St Winnipeg, MB R3M 2V8 Canada",MB,49.8707268,-97.1632326,5,"Came in on Sunday afternoon with a large party, and we were quickly seated to a table and we received waters, drinks and menus right away! The server we had was all smiles and she was welcoming to us without being ""in your face"" (like Earl's or similar chain-style banter).

We had a variety of food off of the menu and aside from there being almost only spicy dishes on the menu, we were accommodated by the cook for getting less spices.

The food came to us quickly from the kitchen, and our server was attentive to us, always checking in throughout our stay. She gave us a lot of choices and she seemed to know ""a little something"" about each of our dishes, drinks and the deserts.

Food was wonderful all the way around, and the service was above par. We really enjoyed our  afternoon, (we stayed quite long, and never felt rushed or pushed to leave the restaurant).

Thank you, I think I speak for everyone in saying that we will definitely return to the Grove."
The Grove Pub & Restaurant,British,"164 Stafford St Winnipeg, MB R3M 2V8 Canada",MB,49.8707268,-97.1632326,5,"The food was delicious, the atmosphere relaxed, an overall delightful experience.

We had the three weekend specials (see photos) and shared. We decided the pizza was the best of the three; the salmon and the lamb sandwich were really good but were surpassed by the pizza.

We ate on the patio and it wasn't too noisy  as it was on a side street. Not too crowded.

A little pricey but I would definitely recommend for a special night out."
JOEY Polo Park,Canadian (New),"635 Saint James St Winnipeg, MB R3G 3R4 Canada",MB,49.8816013,-97.2011837,5,"Initially was a little bit of a wait to get our order taken, but the staff were so kind and accommodating once the issue was brought to light. We enjoyed every single dish we ordered, and the food came out almost immediately. Our server, Noah B, stepped in when we were left waiting and was absolutely amazing. He was very efficient in taking our orders and bringing us our food, and was a joy to be around and talk to! He also went the extra mile in getting us free drinks and dessert because of the original wait. Plus, he went the extra mile in putting a sweet little message with our dessert when he found out it was our anniversary (pictured) :)"

Loved the presentation, taste of the food is ok. Had a good experience.

I just didn't like how they didn't have blinds to remove some bright outside light.

Food is a hit or miss sometimes, so go at times when not so busy

Also sushi cone sucks 90% rice, 10% fish"

Packed over st Patrick’s day but still great service. I ordered the herb salmon. Salmon was small but with recession I get the portion control. Mashed was awesome and veggies were still crunchy. Food came fast!
Always can count on some good food, ambiance and service!"

Was lucky enough to roll the dice on a chance at supper, and ended up putting this place into our Google Maps.   Ended up coming to Capital Grill and Bar, and all I can say is what an incredible experience.

From the wait staff, hosts, and chef, we were amazingly surprised!
The service was incredible, and the food was that much better.

Winnipeg is lucky to have an incredible.resturant like this with so many unique flavours.

Thank you to the crew at Capital - can not wait to come back!"

The service was exceptional. One of the servers saw I had a cut finger and offered me a bandaid. We live in the area and yet we kept procrastinating to come here. We look forward to coming back."

It was a busy day and they could not fit us inside, so the owner Greg asked us if we would be comfortable on the patio. The service he provided us was the best service I have ever received, we all were blown away. The food and drinks were excellent and came relatively quickly, and he checked on us frequently. He even pulled out a heater so we wouldn’t get cold. Not one of us had any complaints and we all will be back. Highly recommend this place."

Our today’s server - Alex was deeply knowledgeable and helpful. It was a prominent example  of professional service.
The food was delicious and drinks were tasty.
I truly recommend this place!"
Cibo Waterfront Cafe,Mediterranean,"339 Waterfront Drive Winnipeg, MB R3B 0G8 Canada",MB,49.8987619,-97.1318846,4,"This was my first time coming to this restaurant and it was great!
I came with a group of six, including myself, and I absolutely loved the table we were sat at. It was a triangle shape, which allowed us all to see each other and hold great conversations, unlike a rectangular table would.
Staff were very friendly and attentive as well.
The restaurant had a beautiful indoor atmosphere, which created a calm and relaxing environment.
My entree, the Scampi, was delicious! The Tiger Prawns are great quality. The pasta sauce was full of flavour with a little kick!
I was eager to try the raspberry cheesecake, but they unfortunately ran out and I resorted to a mocha cheesecake- which was delicious! Very rich and creamy.

Side note: the restroom is in the hotel across from the Cibo’s front entrance. Staff have to walk you to the hotel door to let you in!"
Cibo Waterfront Cafe,Mediterranean,"339 Waterfront Drive Winnipeg, MB R3B 0G8 Canada",MB,49.8987619,-97.1318846,2,"Their Carbonara didn’t taste like it used to so we asked the manager if they have changed their food, we were told it depends on how long the pasta is cooked with tomatoes but Carbonara doesn’t have tomatoes. Other tables had their water refilled multiple times but we only got a refill when we stopped the waiter and asked. We were happy to share our food with flies maybe they liked it?
They also need to have a more detailed menu as they have some ingredients that are in their food but not listed on their menu."
Bistro Dansk,Modern European,"63 Sherbrook St Winnipeg, MB R3C 2B2 Canada",MB,49.8806063,-97.159425,5,"Excellent schnitzel!   We had one plate of pork schnitzel and one plate of chicken schnitzel.  The o’brine potatoes were delicious!  The bread basket was fantastic but could have used a bit more butter.  The service was shockingly fast!  The only thing I didn’t care for was the hazelnut pie, I felt like it was missing something like a gooey filling.  The eclair was very good.  We will definitely be back!

Tip: bathrooms are in the basement."
Bistro Dansk,Modern European,"63 Sherbrook St Winnipeg, MB R3C 2B2 Canada",MB,49.8806063,-97.159425,3,"An underwhelming experience overall.

The chicken schnitzel with O'Brien potatoes and sweet and sour cabbage was definitely the highlight. All the flavors were excellent and the portions were generous. Very crisp and tasty schnitzel. On the other hand, the paprika chicken was disappointing. The portion size was generous again; however, the flavours were nothing special and the dish was overpriced in our opinion.

The server was curt throughout the meal and we felt like we were inconveniencing them. Not friendly and made no attempt at making it a personal experience. Besides this, it is a cozy little restaurant for a winter evening. The food also arrived quickly and drinks were refilled as needed.

I wouldn't call it a terrible experience by any means but I doubt we will be back. We have wanted to try Bistro Dansk for a few years after hearing many recommendations but our experience fell flat. 3 out of 5 stars."
Bistro Dansk,Modern European,"63 Sherbrook St Winnipeg, MB R3C 2B2 Canada",MB,49.8806063,-97.159425,5,"Absolutely yes
Hype is real - get the pork schnitzel!

They were kind enough to allow us to dine in for lunch at 1:30p even though they closed between 2-5p. Crispiest schnitzel I’ve ever had, and the cabbage on the side is so tasty. Lunch plate is an excellent portion size - you get two schnitzels! (Lunch is also better priced than dinner)

I can see during busy services having one server might increase your wait time, but staff is extremely kind and humble, and I love that it’s a family business. Charming restaurant (it’s not very big) and was featured on “You Gotta Eat Here!”."
Bistro Dansk,Modern European,"63 Sherbrook St Winnipeg, MB R3C 2B2 Canada",MB,49.8806063,-97.159425,3,"I went here on a date a few weeks ago. The decor and ambiance is incredible! I really liked the homey feel of the restaurant. The staff were super friendly and personable. You can really tell the food is home style with good simple ingredients. For this reason, some dishes might take longer to come out (which they give proper notice of and is expected when items are prepared for you and not in mass). The chicken soup was pretty delicious and I liked the walnut stuffing in the chicken. I thought the schnitzel was impressively crispy and the sour kraut was good. The desserts are interesting, for example the hazel nut pie is made with a lot of actual hazel nuts as opposed to Nutella or extract (is what it seemed like). Flavor-wise, it tasted like my mom was in the kitchen, which is good, but flavors I can accomplish at home. Overall I'm glad we tried it!"
Bistro Dansk,Modern European,"63 Sherbrook St Winnipeg, MB R3C 2B2 Canada",MB,49.8806063,-97.159425,5,"It's been years since I was last here.... Why did it take so long to return?? Delicious meal, friendly staff, cozy environment and enormous portions.  Reasonably priced for the amount of food you get.  The cabbage side dish is phenomenal as are the O'Brian potatoes.  Be sure to try the schnitzel! I won't wait this long for my next visit."
529 Wellington,Steakhouses,"529 Wellington Cresent Winnipeg, MB R3M 0A1 Canada",MB,49.876662,-97.1613829,5,"One of the best steaks you will have hands down. This is a classic fine dining experience so be ready to pay for it. And pay well! But it's worth every penny and I fell in love with their rib eye steak. The service is top notch and the decor is super classy. It has the old school English vibe and it was great.

The steak was delicious. It was nicely pink in the middle and juicy. You have a ton of options for side dishes and we loved the spinach. However the mushroom wasn't all that and it felt a little oily. The star is the steak and you have to try it.

It's not just the food but an experience."
529 Wellington,Steakhouses,"529 Wellington Cresent Winnipeg, MB R3M 0A1 Canada",MB,49.876662,-97.1613829,3,"My husband and I came for a date night after work. As construction season is here and traffic is bad everywhere, we decided to come to dinner straight from work. I’m not sure if it was because we weren’t dress up and came in work clothing, we felt our server wasn’t interested in serving us. Though we were willing to pay for the food!

He didn’t introduce their feature for the night when he first came over. We even asked for recommendation, he briefly mentioned a few appetizers and still did not mention their feature items. We overheard the feature items from the tables beside us. My husband wanted to order beef Wellington and didn’t see it in the menu so he thought they no longer carry this item. Imagine his surprise when he overheard the conversation in the next table! Overall, we felt judged. Our food was great, just disappointed at the service.

We were looking forward to dinner experience and left disappointed. We haven’t been to 529 Wellington since COVID. It was different a very different experience in comparison to when we last came here!"
529 Wellington,Steakhouses,"529 Wellington Cresent Winnipeg, MB R3M 0A1 Canada",MB,49.876662,-97.1613829,5,"529 is great. We love the food and the ambiance. Whether we are stopping in for a quick lunch or dinner, the service has always been wonderful.

The food isn’t groundbreaking, but they do serve classics and they serve them well.

If you intend to come for dinner, I would recommend making a reservation, esp on the weekends as they do tend to be busy.

We, personally, prefer the lunch ambiance because it’s not busy and super laid back."
529 Wellington,Steakhouses,"529 Wellington Cresent Winnipeg, MB R3M 0A1 Canada",MB,49.876662,-97.1613829,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at 529 Wellington, and I have to say it was an absolutely amazing experience. From the moment we walked in, we were  greeted by the friendly and welcoming staff. The decor was beautiful and inviting, with a cozy and rustic feel.

The menu was extensive and had something for everyone, but I decided to try one of the their Canadian Prime steaks they are know for and I was not disappointed. The flavors were expertly balanced and the presentation was stunning. Each bite was a taste sensation, and I couldn't help but savor every mouthful.  The side dishes are also wonderful for sharing with the table and are portioned large enough for many to enjoy.

The service was top-notch, with the waitstaff being attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. They were happy to make recommendations and helped me pair my meal with the perfect wine. I also appreciated that they checked in on us multiple times throughout the meal to ensure everything was to our satisfaction.

The restaurant also had a great atmosphere, with a lively but not overwhelming buzz. It was the perfect spot for a date night or a special occasion. I also loved that they had a great selection of desserts, and I couldn't resist trying their homemade lemon cheesecake. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a fantastic fine dining experience, I highly recommend checking out 529 Wellington. The food, service, and atmosphere are all top-notch and I can't wait to go back and try more of their delicious dishes."

So hospitable and accommodating. The chow mein was a revellation. It was not greasy at all! My daughter loved the wonton soup which was divine. They gave us free rice and soda too.

The restaurant is located in The Norwood Hotel. The restaurant itself is renovated and it looks great! The server, Alice, was very attentive and friendly. I got the Tacos and they were delicious. My girlfriends got the lettuce wraps and both added the protein to it. The portions for the lettuce wraps were tiny. Everything came in separate dishes and you had to construct it your own. Definitely recommend adding the protein because it is a very small portion.
All in all it was really good, and I would be back!"

Would definitely recommend it."

Fries were crispy and the wings were alright, the sauces I got were good, honey dill and some honey mustard I think? The taste just fell flat and charred.

@TheWoodTavern, Thanks for the response, I did make an issue on Skip and it wasn't full filled. Thanks
@TheWoodTavern, thank you but you didn't have to do that, nothing yet. I appreciate the gesture."

Dancing Noodle,Chinese,"1393A Pembina Highway Winnipeg, MB R3T 2B8 Canada",MB,49.8384744,-97.1517795,4,"I enjoyed my quick stop here. The place has a big variety of noodle dishes and they are good, but what really stood out was their dumplings.

With a butterie and zesty flavour, dumplings were melting in my mouth. The place seems to be owned and managed by a family, grandma was in the front folding dumplings.

Wee bit of a suggestion, the dining area need a bit of... care. Making a few small improvements will make dine-in enjoyable."

We definitely recommend all the above dishes!!"

Every time we have gone here for dinner (I think this was our fourth time), the food has been prepared beautifully, the flavours paired nicely, the service polite and attentive, and the portions and prices impressive. I can honestly say that some of my favorite dishes I have ever had in Winnipeg have been at The Blue Marble. The atmosphere is very nice and calm, and I enjoyed the choice of music playing over the speaker while we dined, so that's a bonus. I will be thinking of that dessert for a long time: Banana bread french toast with apple cinnamon ice cream...mmmm! We will definitely be back."
The Blue Marble Restaurant & Lounge,Tapas/Small Plates,"1979 Wellington Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3H 1H5 Canada",MB,49.9047955,-97.2249427,3,"My first visit at this restaurant and even though the food was pretty good I doubt I will be back. The airport location is a bit out of the way but the main deterrent for me was the complete lack of ambiance. The restaurant is right next to a fairly busy walkway and has windows all around. I felt pretty uncomfortable with people walking by and literally staring into my plate. Maybe tinting the windows might solve this problem? The restaurant had more of a cafeteria vibe rather than a higher scale restaurant.
The food...nice presentation, pretty good but nothing that made me say wow. The serving staff were very nice even when they were dealing with a extremely drunk and belligerent customer who was disturbing everyone."
The Blue Marble Restaurant & Lounge,Tapas/Small Plates,"1979 Wellington Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3H 1H5 Canada",MB,49.9047955,-97.2249427,5,"I stopped in to have a bite during an overnight layover while staying at a nearby hotel. It was a bit confusing whether or not I could seat myself, but the bartender came up and greeted me within a couple mins. The burger was spectacular and the fries were just right, i have another layover and will be coming back for it again! I had to ask for the bill but it was clear they were very busy so I didn't mind. They only had two people for a whole bar and 20+ tables..."

Blue Marble always has a fantastic wine list which is appreciated and it’s usually quiet but don’t let that fool you. It’s a great place to stop, even if not travelling."

For those who want good food with exceptional flavor pairings and a vast & well-stocked wine room -- this is the place for you.  Will be coming back many more times, I would recommend you do the same. Pricey but worth every cent. Thanks Brett for taking the time to talk wine with me, and Chris for the fast service."
Saperavi,Middle Eastern,"709 Corydon Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M 0W4 Canada",MB,49.8714792,-97.1521675,5,"This is another instance that if I could give more stars, I would. Especially for the service. Our server did an excellent job helping us navigate the menu and suggest dishes we might enjoy. We were those people that asked to be moved after we had been sat and the server was very accommodating.
We ordered the meal for four and it was a LOT of food but if we hadn't done that we would have missed out on some excellent dishes. Like the bread. We would never have ordered the bread and most of the table voted it their favorite part of the meal.
It was not an inexpensive meal but definitely worth it."
Saperavi,Middle Eastern,"709 Corydon Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M 0W4 Canada",MB,49.8714792,-97.1521675,5,"We had a great  time at this place. It was our first visit there so we decided to order the most popular dishes- Khachapuri Adjaruli and Khinkali. We were really impressed, because those meals were so delicious and fulfilling and their price was quite reasonable. So we highly recommend them!!!

However, it should be mentioned that we also had Veal Shashlik which was really tasty, but portion is so small. We had a Large one for 28$ and it was only 6 small pieces, so consider your wishes before ordering Shashlik..

Also, we want to admit the professional and knowledgeable service of their waitress - Olya. She helped us with all inquiries and did the great job!

Overall, we do recommend this place. It is tasty and cosy."
Saperavi,Middle Eastern,"709 Corydon Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M 0W4 Canada",MB,49.8714792,-97.1521675,5,"If you’ve never tried Georgian food, do yourself a favour! Imagine meats marinated in the most flavourful mix of spices cooked over wood coals… side dishes and dips prepared from scratch with fresh veggies and herbs. The food here is of the best quality possible for the price and truly traditional and authentic.

Not only that, but the hospitality and consideration is incredible. Chris - the floor manager personally delivered an order for my mom’s birthday when the delivery apps were down - thank you SO much! My parents  (who never eat out and prefer to cook at home) really enjoyed the meals.

Can’t say enough great things about this place!

PS if you are into wine tasting, they have a great selection of imported Georgian wines."
Saperavi,Middle Eastern,"709 Corydon Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M 0W4 Canada",MB,49.8714792,-97.1521675,4,The food was great! I think it was a very good quality and well made food however the portions were very small compared to prices. Apart from the portion sizes i think it is a good place to go!
Saperavi,Middle Eastern,"709 Corydon Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M 0W4 Canada",MB,49.8714792,-97.1521675,5,"Recently went for dinner here and had a wonderful experience.

The food was simply amazing. So much flavour, but it all worked very well together, no one thing overpowering another. The portions were a good size as well.

The service was great, they timed things very well, so when we were almost done with an appetizer they bring the next item out, no need to sit and wait with empty plates.

The atmosphere was lovely for an evening meal,  close and comfortable without feeling cramped."
Monticchio Ristorante Italiano,Caterers,"684 Osborne Street Winnipeg, MB R3L 2B9 Canada",MB,49.8625412,-97.1320455,5,"I will definitely be coming back. It took a second to find it, but I also was distracted for a second while looking but we arrived.
The food was spectacular. Great portion sizes for price, and it tasted delicious.
I went with my partner and he had the Stromboli, and he had plenty leftover, after he and I shared garlic knots and greek salad, and I had the chicken parmigiana.
Our server was super kind, she came by and kept note of our waters, and helped us a lot.
The tables and chairs were amazing. The place felt cozy and personal, and it felt like i could genuinely enjoy my time with my partner.

I will certainly be going back, and I can't wait til then."
Monticchio Ristorante Italiano,Caterers,"684 Osborne Street Winnipeg, MB R3L 2B9 Canada",MB,49.8625412,-97.1320455,4,I ordered the chicken Parm. The Alfredo sauce was grainy and not outstanding. The chicken was great. We attended as a large group. We had multiple servers and sometimes requests were overlooked as the message didn't make it from one to the other. The atmosphere was great for a staff gathering.
Monticchio Ristorante Italiano,Caterers,"684 Osborne Street Winnipeg, MB R3L 2B9 Canada",MB,49.8625412,-97.1320455,5,"Amazing food! The focaccia was INCREDIBLE. The best I have ever had. The calzone was humongous and just as tasty as it was huge! It could easily feed 2 adults. Get ready to wait a bit longer than usual for food, but it is soooo worth it. The staff are competent and friendly, what more can you ask for in restaurant service?  The reason atmosphere loses points is because the event room near the front of the restaurant got really warm  as the sun filtered in and the people crowded in but it was a very hot day and what can you do? Also the bathroom was kinda dingy, but it was at least clean."
Monticchio Ristorante Italiano,Caterers,"684 Osborne Street Winnipeg, MB R3L 2B9 Canada",MB,49.8625412,-97.1320455,5,"Loved the food! Service was great too! One nitpick: the garlic breadknots we ordered were decisively less fresh than the complementary plain breadknots. That said, I feel like it's still a candidate for the best Italian food in Winnipeg."
Monticchio Ristorante Italiano,Caterers,"684 Osborne Street Winnipeg, MB R3L 2B9 Canada",MB,49.8625412,-97.1320455,5,Very good Italian food! Highly recommend the fettuccini Alfredo!
Tehran Market & Cafe,Mediterranean,"8-1875 Pembina Highway Winnipeg, MB R3T 2G7 Canada",MB,49.8215976,-97.1543929,5,"This place is great! Tehran Cafe is the kind of place that you'll want to come back several times.
They have a bunch of traditional dishes from Iran and they are all amazing!
We enjoyed the Fesenjan and the Ghormeh Sabzi, both were really flavourful and unique, and we could tell that the ingredients used were top notch and the portions were really generous. For the Fesenjan they use a lot of walnuts and for the Ghormeh the beef is really tasty!
The place is also cozy and has a really nice decoration. The owner was really kind and explained us the menu and answered all of our questions. He also recommended us the persian baklava for dessert and we had to orden twice because it was delicious. You should also not miss the pistacho milkshake which I totally recommend.
Tehran Cafe is sure to give you a good experience. I totally recommend it!"

Fergies Fish N Chips & Seafood Market,Seafood,"1 Forks Market Road Suite 142 Winnipeg, MB R3C 4L9 Canada",MB,49.8870659,-97.1314518,5,"Probably the best place in The Forks for food.

Three types of fish to choose from: Cod, Pickerel and Halibut. Everything is prepared on a regular basis, so everything is fresh and crispy.

We opted for cod and it was probably the best choice. The fish is juicy and delicious. We didn't find a single bone in any of the pieces. The dishes are served with tartar sauce and a piece of lemon. Additionally You can choose ketchup or HP sauce in the amount you need.

I highly recommend it, at these prices for a complete dish it is really good choice in The Forks."

The fries for me needs to get replaced maybe use wedges.. they have seasonings so better use them because the fish and fries are pretty tasteless so it's up to you how you make it tasty.

The cod was really good, the batter is not thick unlike other places they put so much batter to make it look bigger. It was cook to perfection, so crispy and very tasty. My hubby had pickerel & stew/chowder  it was also very good & the fish chowder was loaded with fish  and it taste fresh season with like salt and pepper simple and tasty. The fries looks good but it was not really crispy even we eat it right away something that they can improve. The lady that help us was very energetic happy and friendly. The best Fish and Chips place that I have been."

Had the single meal with chowder and fries. The chowder is a fish and shrimp stew. The taste is good but it’s not a “chowder”
Pickerel was small but good. Fries were good. I would gladly trade 2/3 of the fries for a bigger piece of fish

I was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant's amazing food and friendly service. I ordered Edamame for starter and a Salmon Donburi.
* Food *
- Edamame: Not overcooked, nice freshness and satisfyingly crunchy 😋.
- Salmon Donburi: Rice was cooked evenly, came out warm and had a tender texture with a slight chew. The salmon was decent quality with a very clean taste. Its coldness and rich, buttery flavor paired perfectly with the hot and fluffy rice 🤤. The baran was a little off putting but overall very nice dish.

Loved it, very quiet and cozy. Staff were all very friendly.
Highly recommended"

They got this cute menu where you can see how the food will look like which is literally the same.
Service was amazing and people were very friendly. We had the Deep fried chicken dumplings, creamy tempura and mt Fuji.
Overall experience 9/10
So far the best sushi place ever! 🙌🏻"
The Tallest Poppy,Canadian (New),"103 Sherbrook Winnipeg, MB R3C 2B5 Canada",MB,49.8820705,-97.1592888,5,"If you're craving fried chicken, this is the place to go! I had the Chicken and waffles and let me tell you, it was the best fried chicken I've ever had! So crispy and yet so flavourful, my mouth just drooling. And who would have guess it'd go so well on a fluffy Belgian waffle with Blueberry syrup?! The tallest poppy knew! Now add little hot sauce and you've got yourself a delectable orgasm for your tastebuds!"
The Tallest Poppy,Canadian (New),"103 Sherbrook Winnipeg, MB R3C 2B5 Canada",MB,49.8820705,-97.1592888,5,"This place is great.  Hands down, the chicken and waffles (with two eggs on the side) was the best meal I've had at a restaurant in a long time.  I'm not great with names, so I can't remember our server's name, but she was great.  She offered drink suggestions since they were out of what we wanted, and they were really good.  I feel that she was perfectly attentive, sometimes you get servers that come by too often, or not enough.  But that wasn't the case.  Both her and the girl who cleaned our table and seated us were very friendly.  To say the least, our experience here was deserving of a good tip.  This is one of those restaurants I'm going to have to keep note of, I'd like to come back and try some more of the menu very soon."
The Tallest Poppy,Canadian (New),"103 Sherbrook Winnipeg, MB R3C 2B5 Canada",MB,49.8820705,-97.1592888,5,I'm surprised that I haven't tried this place yet as I always passed by this area.

The fresh cheese bread and super crispy chicken make it next level. A creamy peppery coleslaw cut it perfectly. My wife enjoyed the motza soup with mashed potatoes, which she reported was really good, but she kept picking off my meal ;) Atmosphere is very funky and a bit bohemian with great wall art around. Friendly casual servers, limited beer selection but full bar. Eclectic music playing. Great spot!"

The food is absolutely incredible, and the portions are HUGE!!!  Extremely reasonably priced.  I promise that you will not be disappointed.

The Egg Tarts are RIDICULOUSLY amazing - I could eat a dozen!  We also had Taro Root Cake, Spring Rolls, Sesame Balls, Steamed Pork buns and a bunch of other delicious dishes!

The owners are very hard working, and run a wonderful establishment.  We will definitely be back!"

Their Mango Pudding is the best!"

I did include pictures of both menus.

After 2pm this place is a great price as it's dim sum happy hour.

It has been around for a very long time. I came here as a child and they are still running. A long standing establishment that I enjoy going to. It's very much a hole in the wall place.

They do not push the food on carts. You order directly off the menu, but that ensures fresh food. Our meal was $62.83 for 4 people including tea and tax."

White Star Diner,Burgers,"258 Kennedy St Winnipeg, MB R3C 1T2 Canada",MB,49.8911855,-97.1482735,4,"If only this place could be a little bit bigger with more seating options, this would get the full five stars from me! Their food embodies how all diner food should be: it's obvious how much care and effort goes into making these delicious meals. The seating area left a lot to be desired since it was only a handful of tables, booths, and counter seating. My husband needed to borrow a chair to sit comfortably, but the server was definitely friendly and helpful with us throughout the experience. The parking is just ok, but I can definitely see how people can get frustrated trying to find a parking spot nearby.
They have amazing shakes, and their poutine definitely lives up to the high ratings we had heard about! Definitely worth a stop!"

We would go back anytime."

TH Dang Restaurant,Vietnamese,"1425 Pembina Highway Winnipeg, MB R3T 2C2 Canada",MB,49.8374043,-97.1513843,5,Omg the best soup we’ve ever had. You must try Beef Sate noodle soup! The other two dishes (pho and lemongrass chicken) we had were good but the beef sate noodle soup was very memorable.
TH Dang Restaurant,Vietnamese,"1425 Pembina Highway Winnipeg, MB R3T 2C2 Canada",MB,49.8374043,-97.1513843,4,"Food is actually very good and filling. I had the spicy vermicelli soup and spring rolls. Beef Pho is also good.

TH Dang Restaurant,Vietnamese,"1425 Pembina Highway Winnipeg, MB R3T 2C2 Canada",MB,49.8374043,-97.1513843,5,"Tried the crispy spicy pork, deep fried spring rolls, Vietnamese style coffee, and our regular, deluxe beef pho. Best pho in Winnipeg with a great broth. Great flavor in the pork and spring rolls. The pork is pretty spicy so this dish is not for you if you can't handle high spice levels. First time trying Vietnamese style coffee and it was really good."
Smith Restaurant,Canadian (New),"75 Forks Market Road Winnipeg, MB R3C 4Y3 Canada",MB,49.8879173,-97.1295363,5,"My family likes that the food on the menu tasted different. It was unique and gave an experience congruent to the vibe The Forks offers. We also likenthe dinner ware. We ordered mushroom toast with beets, lamb, pickerel, meat balls."
Smith Restaurant,Canadian (New),"75 Forks Market Road Winnipeg, MB R3C 4Y3 Canada",MB,49.8879173,-97.1295363,5,"Had a great dinner full of laughs and delicious food. Our server was excellent and gave us some tips on new drinks to check out and was very informative about the food. Really enjoyed all of the dishes, I personally recommend the rack of lamb. Nice place for a date or just to go have some fancy cocktails."
Smith Restaurant,Canadian (New),"75 Forks Market Road Winnipeg, MB R3C 4Y3 Canada",MB,49.8879173,-97.1295363,3,"Visited just before the dinner rush.

Service was pretty good. We made a reservation for a certain number of people, and they gave us enough seats, but for some reason, we were missing two sets of flatware and napkins. It was corrected, but it felt like the server didn't believe us at first.

Aside from that, our server was really polite and accommodating the whole time. I appreciated her patience since we were a pretty big group. There is an 18% gratuity included for bigger groups.

I ordered the Pan Fried Bearcat Pickerel. The taste was very mild, and overall, it was just okay. There is nothing to write home about. I wouldn't really recommend it. My partner ordered the special, which was a modern surf and turf with pork belly and octopus. That was much more flavourful. I say to definitely try asking what the special is before ordering. Food is very pricey, but you can see that in their menu online.

Overall, it was a good experience, but I won't go out of my way to come back."
Smith Restaurant,Canadian (New),"75 Forks Market Road Winnipeg, MB R3C 4Y3 Canada",MB,49.8879173,-97.1295363,5,Excellent food and service yesterday! Definitely will come again. I recommend the buttermilk fried chicken with the Brussel sprouts as a side.
Smith Restaurant,Canadian (New),"75 Forks Market Road Winnipeg, MB R3C 4Y3 Canada",MB,49.8879173,-97.1295363,4,"I had a few hours to kill while I waited for people and wanted to try someplace new. And this place had eggs bennie. I'll just say that the only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 was it was a really cold day and the tea for my Earl Grey came tepid. I really wanted hot tea and it doesn't take that long to preheat a cup. The eggs Benedict were good, not eggsellent but good. I loved the crunchy potatoes.
All in all, it was a good place for breakfast and to wait out a few hours watching people."
New Golden Inn Restaurant,Chinese,"1084 Pembina Hwy Winnipeg, MB R3T 1Z9 Canada",MB,49.8490547,-97.1523223,5,Amazing restaurant. Food is always tasty and healthy. Owners are really nice. Great price and delivery option. Large menu selection. Thank you
New Golden Inn Restaurant,Chinese,"1084 Pembina Hwy Winnipeg, MB R3T 1Z9 Canada",MB,49.8490547,-97.1523223,1,"I have been going here for years.  I can tell that the owners of old must have sold the restaurant to someone who hates their customers.
To start the rice was days old. They served us old rice they didnt want to throw out.  Then, We try to ordered chow mein.  The server asked if we meant bean sprouts with dry noodles.
I told her no, even argued that we wanted fried noodles.
Whoever took the order insisted we have bean sprout chop suey.  I told them I wanted chow mien noodles.   They sent me the bean sprout chop suey anyhow with dry noodles in a bag.
The beaf stew with bean cake had no meat in it. It was all cheap vegetables and tofu.   The real insult was the fact they used rotten bok choy that had black mold on it in the dish.   Something tasted off immediately.   By the time we noticed they had closed.  And we even tipped them for the abuse.  Not only would I not recommend anyone going here ever I will be reporting this establishment for their gross misconduct."
New Golden Inn Restaurant,Chinese,"1084 Pembina Hwy Winnipeg, MB R3T 1Z9 Canada",MB,49.8490547,-97.1523223,5,"We ordered pic up some beef chow fun, Singapore noodles, and Cantonese Sweet and sour pork
The food was tasty and plentiful. I can’t believe how many times I have driven past it, and never ordered from it. I see there were some negative comments on delivery times. I ordered in person and waited, the food was ready in less than 15 min.
Give it a try!"
New Golden Inn Restaurant,Chinese,"1084 Pembina Hwy Winnipeg, MB R3T 1Z9 Canada",MB,49.8490547,-97.1523223,1,"Ordered the Cantonese chow mein for pick up. Haven’t ordered since Christmas
Used to be excellent
Wondered why it was so heavy
Must be a ton of noodles I thought
Yummy!
They filled it with gravy/ juice???? WTH????!!!!
No taste, very little noodles, minimal veggies
Drained out the “juice” container was less than 1/2 full 😡
Get your old chef back!"
New Golden Inn Restaurant,Chinese,"1084 Pembina Hwy Winnipeg, MB R3T 1Z9 Canada",MB,49.8490547,-97.1523223,4,"My husband loves Chinese food with a passion. I'm not quite at his level of devotion, but this place is really good. The Golden Inn Beef is my favorite, and any of their hot plate choice are delicious. Word of warning: don't get the fried rice. There's absolutely nothing special about it, very bland and dry. Other than that, this is a great place."
Colosseo Ristorante Italiano,Caterers,"670 Corydon Ave Winnipeg, MB R3M 0X7 Canada",MB,49.8715228,-97.1503885,2,"The setting of places excellent, one can imagine that one is in Italy.
The seasoning of the food is very nice, the quality of the ingredients is good.
Unfortunately the service is terribly bad, the assignment of the table did not take long, but it took almost half an hour to take our order and almost an hour to serve us, then to ask for the bill was a similar story. It wasn't that there were many people, the service staff wasted a lot of time, joking with each other.

It's not a bad place when you have a lot of time to waste."
Colosseo Ristorante Italiano,Caterers,"670 Corydon Ave Winnipeg, MB R3M 0X7 Canada",MB,49.8715228,-97.1503885,5,"This restaurant has the most cozy atmosphere and delicious food. It is filled with Italian and Roman decorations, which adds to the charm of dinning there. The menu has so many options but for us the standout dishes were the onion and seafood soups, which were delicious. Also, the pastas were fantastic, especially the Linguini alla Pescatora and Linguini al Vongole. Both had amazing sauces and were rich in flavour. The service was excellent, with attentive and really nice staff. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for delicious Italian food in a super cozy atmosphere."
Colosseo Ristorante Italiano,Caterers,"670 Corydon Ave Winnipeg, MB R3M 0X7 Canada",MB,49.8715228,-97.1503885,1,"Where do I start?

The first thing I thought when I was here with my partner was ""I've always wanted to try this place out!"". The second one was ""I think I've seen this episode of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares before"". Some first impressions are the most important, but in this case, it was the second.

My partner got the pesto linguine, which as you can see from the attached photo, was drenched in oil. Immediately upon receiving the plate, pushing down gently on the noodles revealed a layer of oil underneath. Halfway through, as shown, the situation hadn't improved. I could picture Gordon Ramsay commenting about the quantity of oil, probably using language more colourful than the basil.

I had looked at the menu and saw ""homemade pasta"", with an entry for cannelloni. I make fresh pasta semi-regularly, so I was excited to try this entree. What I got was _not_ what I was anticipating. As before, images of Gordon Ramsay shouting ""it's not fresh, it's frozen!"" popped into my mind. The meat mixture alone was... off. The taste was acceptable but no more, but the texture was pasty at best. And the pasta. The pasta was well and truly bad. Fresh, homemade pasta is not a hard thing to make. Even just semolina and water can give excellent results. This, however, was not that. It had clearly been frozen at some point in it's lifecycle, perhaps long ago. It cracked a little from the dry interior as I cut through it with the knife. The flavor was off as well, in a way that I cannot explain. I've had better noodles from a grocery store box, by an order of magnitude. I've also had better frozen meat filled pasta dishes from a grocery store box as well.

And that's nothing to say of the overall experience. The staff cut my partner off twice when asking a question, put their hands on our shoulders without asking, and were the loudest fixture of the establishment. The guests were far quieter, and the only ""ambience"" was the staff joking with each other while sharing things on their phones.

Overall, this trip was characterized by regret. My stomach, not 30 minutes from my experience there, is gurgling and uncomfortable. My partner's is as well. For $30 a plate you would expect quality or at least quantity, but we received neither. I regret choosing to not waste the food, I regret making the choice to give it a try, and I regret mostly not having a personal tip line to Gordon Ramsay.

Edited to add: 2 hours after our seating my partner is now throwing up. 0 stars?"
Colosseo Ristorante Italiano,Caterers,"670 Corydon Ave Winnipeg, MB R3M 0X7 Canada",MB,49.8715228,-97.1503885,5,"Honestly I can't find better pasta & pizza than Colosseo in Winnipeg. If I want some pizza or pasta, I literally only visit this restaurant.

A bit loud inside, so 3 stars for atmosphere, however except for that, everything is perfect!

Recommended 👍🏻"
Colosseo Ristorante Italiano,Caterers,"670 Corydon Ave Winnipeg, MB R3M 0X7 Canada",MB,49.8715228,-97.1503885,4,Great food! Loved the pasta and pizza. Our server was energetic and enthusiastic while explaining the menu and serving. The only thing that didn't work for me was the atmosphere...almost dungeon-like interiors lighted with only artificial lighting. Patio seating may be better. A little on the pricey side but still worth it.
Jollibee,Chicken Shop,"1406 Ellice Ave Winnipeg, MB R3G 0G4 Canada",MB,49.8934896,-97.1985133,5,"When my wife asked for Jollibee for her birthday, I knew there was no denying that request. I mean, who am I to stand in the way of a Jollibee celebration?! Back in the Philippines, Jollibee was a staple for all our special occasions - birthdays, graduations, even just getting a good grade on a test. And let me tell you, every time I sink my teeth into their food, it's like a trip down memory lane to my childhood.

My go-to favorites are the Filipino-style spaghetti - sweet, meaty, and just like how I remember it; the Palabok Fiesta, which is a fiesta in my mouth with all its amazing flavors; and of course, the Spicy Chicken Joy - crispy, juicy, and oh so satisfying. Honestly, I could eat this every single day and never get tired of it.

So if you haven't tried Jollibee yet, consider this your official sign to go and check it out. You won't regret it - trust me, it's a whole experience in itself!"""
Jollibee,Chicken Shop,"1406 Ellice Ave Winnipeg, MB R3G 0G4 Canada",MB,49.8934896,-97.1985133,5,"So this was my first time dining at Jollibee. I've always seen the very distinct signage and was curious about the place. My perspective of the place was that it was inviting when I first entered the establishment I quickly came to the realization that this place was very popular for many people. I like the relaxed feeling in the atmosphere. It wasn't congested, the staff were really relaxed and continually on the spot with their roles, this made it feel even more welcoming.

The seating was comfortable and not cramped.

The speed of the service was excellent. When I asked for extra napkins a staff member stopped what she was doing and kindly obliged.

I liked the chicken it was something new to me the way the chicken was really crispy.

I gave this rating a five in atmosphere and service and only a four for food because I just selected exactly what my friend was having. I'm sure if I picked what I would have really wanted I would have given it four stars.

I'm giving this a 5 star overall because I was so relieved that it wasn't one of those nightmare food runs.

Overall no complaints."
Jollibee,Chicken Shop,"1406 Ellice Ave Winnipeg, MB R3G 0G4 Canada",MB,49.8934896,-97.1985133,5,"Had the regular and spicy chicken, mashed potatoes and fries.

Really like the chicken.  Enjoyed it much better than KFC and Popeyes.

Kids really liked the pineapple quencher. Reminds me of drinking the pineapple juice of a can of dole pineapple.

Overall, very good for a fast food chain."
Jollibee,Chicken Shop,"1406 Ellice Ave Winnipeg, MB R3G 0G4 Canada",MB,49.8934896,-97.1985133,4,"Place is good, pleasant people, food is good but sometimes their chicken is  undercooked.

Parking is a challenge ;) which also means that the place is popular, especially to Filipinos."
Jollibee,Chicken Shop,"1406 Ellice Ave Winnipeg, MB R3G 0G4 Canada",MB,49.8934896,-97.1985133,2,Doesnt even taste and look like Jollibee anymore. The chicken was old and the batter was too hard on the outside and undercooked on the inside. Hope it was a one time thing.

Only downside is that they're often very busy and it may take some time to get your order as everything is being made in the back from scratch.

I'd recommend getting a reservation and ordering appetizers. So you're not dissapointed."

Just at the restaurant with a full tummy but want to eat more because it is just simply too good. Ordered combination and a cerveza! Now I want to try all of their menu.

Red Top Drive Inn,Burgers,"219 Saint Mary's Road Winnipeg, MB R2H 1J2 Canada",MB,49.8754321,-97.117725,4,"An old time classic and iconic diner. An amazing ""find"" in THE PEG after a long road trip which ended here. Fortunately I have a life-long friend who resides here and knew I would LUUUUVVV this place.
Our gregarious server, Vickie was a joy and when I found out they served COKE FLOATS I was blown away. I have not had one in decades!!! The chocolate milkshake was a bit of a watery disappointment which did not taste like it was made with actual ice cream.
The GREEK CHICKEN BURGER was a lovely grilled breast but a bit smothered in too much tzatziki sauce which overpowered its flavour.The CHEEZ-BURGER was a delicious hand made pattie of flavourful juicy  meat, but, again, was a bit disappointing with the addition of a very smoky chili sauce which overpowered the burger. Apparently this is the house specialty which I did not know about and will know better the next visit.
A pleasure to see places like this still exist. And a great end to a sadly short visit."
Red Top Drive Inn,Burgers,"219 Saint Mary's Road Winnipeg, MB R2H 1J2 Canada",MB,49.8754321,-97.117725,4,"It’s a very busy and highly popular restaurant. I mean not by the internet influence, but loved by local people.
You could be waiting for a while to get your meal, but definitely worth to wait.
I like the fried chicken and Bolognese pasta. I guess many people be here for the burger. Burgers are also good. And you could be very comfortable to have a meal with your family or closest friends.
I saw there’s a Christmas card send from a customer to the staff. You can see, neighbors loves it. And many people come to eat as a naturally choice."
Red Top Drive Inn,Burgers,"219 Saint Mary's Road Winnipeg, MB R2H 1J2 Canada",MB,49.8754321,-97.117725,5,The food was absolutely Incredible big huge portions I will definitely be coming again and you spend half the money you would if you went to a fancy restaurant and you actually leave full !

Spicy Noodle House,Chinese,"99 Osborne Street Suite 102 Winnipeg, MB R3L 2R4 Canada",MB,49.8787065,-97.1463592,5,"The food arrived hot, and tasted absolutely delicious!

I would highly recommend the sweet and sour chicken, as basic as that sounds it was probably the best sweet and sour chicken I have ever had.

The noodles were nice as well, veggies tasted fresh. Even the rice was soft and fresh which you don't see to often anymore. The satay sauce is also very tasty!

Will be ordering here again. Really impressed with the quality and price."

Spicy Noodle House,Chinese,"99 Osborne Street Suite 102 Winnipeg, MB R3L 2R4 Canada",MB,49.8787065,-97.1463592,2,"Ordered on skip. Got the peanut soup. The broth was thin and there was a bad almost vinigar taste to it. If I had not paid money I would not have eaten it.
The spicy beef was okay.
We also got the curry chicken. It wasnt really a curry. The chicken was kind slimy. We did not eat it.
We wanted to try something new. We will never order from here again. Very expensive and we couldnt eat one dish, didnt really like but ate the soup. Only the beef was okay, but not that good."
Spicy Noodle House,Chinese,"99 Osborne Street Suite 102 Winnipeg, MB R3L 2R4 Canada",MB,49.8787065,-97.1463592,4,"Whenever I'm sick I get soup here. The broth is full of flavour. Unfortunately I usually can't taste much else as when I'm sick my sinuses are blocked. Reasonably priced for Osborne village.
Also even though I haven't actually eaten here when I'm not sick, for the last 10 years, it's the Village! Every restaurant here is good! Most have some creative aspect to them because it's the Village! But it's Chinese food... The broth for soup is flavourful you know that the food is good."
Tandoor House,Indian,"598 Ebby Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M Canada",MB,49.8609364,-97.149276,1,"Don't come to this place for buffet!! Just don't!  We went there today for buffet and found out there was nothing.  Only 5 chicken pieces and 2 pieces of beef on the meat part. We paid 16.99 dollars and had nothing to eat. Only veggies. We asked them more than 3 times to refill but they did not. And all of them were inside the kitchen. I don't know what went wrong today. It was a dinner buffet. One of my friends didn't even get to eat a single chicken piece. There was no tandoori chicken available. The samosas were stale from the day before so we threw it away. We called the waiter n told her that samosas were stale but she kept on denying. Worst place
I'm sooo mad. Paid 16.99 dollars plus tax n got out starving. I hate myself for even coming here. Don't go. There are many other Indian places just go there if it comes for buffet!"
Tandoor House,Indian,"598 Ebby Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M Canada",MB,49.8609364,-97.149276,4,"Came here for their lunch buffet on a Sunday.  The food was good, the naan that comes with the bread was hot and crispy when it came.  Decent variety of meat and veggies dishes."
Tandoor House,Indian,"598 Ebby Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M Canada",MB,49.8609364,-97.149276,1,"Had the Buffett, meh.
The butter chicken isn't even decent.
The Nann bread is doughy.
The pea, corn, slime was acctualy food.
Service is weak, slow, impersonal but also it's kind of nice to be left alone.
The fruit plate you get for free is pretty ok.
The Indian pasta was edible.
The rice was good.
The Buffett price is was to high ($13.99) for what you get
I wouldn't go back.
I didn't even want to pay for the food.
My total for 2 was $31.64 the guy stood there staring at the money and eventually came to the conclusion the out of $40 my change would be $6."
Tandoor House,Indian,"598 Ebby Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M Canada",MB,49.8609364,-97.149276,1,It was a whole empty area. It was dead I understand the point cause may be it was not the peak time. But it was dead in a sense that someone wouldn't wanna go and sit there to feel more lonely. Apart from that the food wasn't good enough to substitute with loneliness. We ordered 2 things from the menu. One of them was Naan with Shahi paneer they served in a to go tray like the subway stores have for dinning inside. Pretty bad experience.. It wasn't worth it. If you can see in the picture that's how they served the food.
Tandoor House,Indian,"598 Ebby Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3M Canada",MB,49.8609364,-97.149276,2,Been waiting over 20 for a pickup. Yet the dining room had only 2 table. Very slow.
The Nook Diner,Diners,"43 Sherbrook Street Winnipeg, MB R3C 2B1 Canada",MB,49.8801326,-97.1593862,5,"The Nook Diner does not pretend to be anything fancy, it's an old school family restaurant where portion sizes are generous and the menu is straightforward: breakfast all day, a few salads, burgers and sandwiches.
We were a large group on father's day and food arrived at the same time, and at the correct temperature. We had blueberry pancakes, grilled cheese sandwich, eggs benedict, a cheese dog, the chili cheeseburger and two eggs breakfast. Food was good, coffee was okay, service was excellent.

Last few visits were so disappointing that I don’t think I’ll go again. The prices have more than doubled (I can understand some increased pricing due to inflation, but the quality has also gone way down) - and 20.00 for a Benedict felt excessive for a locally owned diner. More expensive than Stella’s or Clementine! For a humble diner! Portion sizes are smaller and there were what seemed to be eyelashes or small hairs on my plate and my partner’s plate (??) careless presentation. Very sad!!! I’m so sorry to leave this review but I’m just so disappointed."
The Nook Diner,Diners,"43 Sherbrook Street Winnipeg, MB R3C 2B1 Canada",MB,49.8801326,-97.1593862,1,"Was my favourite and most reliable breakfast spot in WPG. Great staff. I’m all for price adjustments, but my go-to omelette went up by $5.50 last time I stopped in. Hard to justify an omelette for $17.50.

I ordered Gnocchi Al Tartufo but Gnocchi ran out so I got it substituted with Capellini. Then had a tiramisu. Finally tried a cappuccino with amaretto and topped it all off with a pistachio gelato. Cappuccino, gelato, wines were awesome, service was wonderful, ambience was spectacular (I sat outside, Al-fresco)!!! However the pasta dish and tiramisu were just okay, because the taste was bland! They mention the use of truffle oil but I could not smell it or taste it in the dish…moreover the tiramisu was dry and had a very subtle hint of espresso; so these dishes should have been flavourful for the appreciation!"
Mona Lisa Ristorante Italiano,Italian,"1697 Corydon Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3N 0J9 Canada",MB,49.8640977,-97.196843,5,Was here for a staff gathering during their regularly closed hours. We were able to eat and then play bocci ball on their courts which was super fun!  Service was perfect and the wine selection was great!  Very very helpful staff!  I’ve been her before and this just solidified my reasons for liking it. We had a buffet style meal which was really good and they looked after all the special diets in our group very nicely.

Mona Lisa Ristorante Italiano,Italian,"1697 Corydon Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3N 0J9 Canada",MB,49.8640977,-97.196843,2,"The front of the house was totally disorganized. Our server was doing the best he could with his workload being half the restaurant. The owner was walking around oblivious to the patrons trying to catch her eye for help. When I finally stopped another woman working there asking questions about dessert she had no clue. Would I go back? Never. Was the food good? Absolutely. I think the young family who took the restaurant over from their retired parents need to keep their eye on their customers and stop walking around like we should be grateful we are allowed into their restaurant. And the gelato was so cold the flavour could not be determined, my partner’s gelato was filled with ice crystals.
Our bill for 2 was just under 200.00.
My opinion.

Update. I was not complaining about our server he was doing his best.  I was pointing out the owner never took the time to actually see what was happening in her restaurant. The two ladies at the table behind us who had different server were having the same issues."

Both French Onion Soup and Clam Chowder are exceptional! Beef ribs is a bit spicy but tastes great. Kid menu offers lots of choices, and we particularly like the pasta – a bit under-seasoned for adults, but just right for kids or toddlers. The creamy crab dip with crostini (forgot the official name on menu) was a bit salty, but is still fine. Overall a great dining experience. Will definitely go again."

We had the mashed potatoes with gravy - was very creamy.  Started with a tossed salad- lots of salad dressings to choose from.  Fantastic flavours with this meal - the breading on the large prawns was crunchy and well seasoned.  Really enjoyed it.  BBQ sauce on the chicken and ribs was perfect.  Rib meat feel off the bone.  The chicken was fantastic.  Green beans were seasoned with a herb vinaigrette- was very nice.  The restaurant was very busy that night, but our server was attentive, friendly and helpful.  Great experience at this local restaurant.   Would definitely go there again."
Silver Heights Restaurant & Lounge,Steakhouses,"2169 Portage Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3J 0L7 Canada",MB,49.8770034,-97.238833,5,"An old-school beef meat place.  If you're old enough to remember when ""steak houses"" were a thing you'll feel right at home.  If you're not, this place will make you wish you were sixty so you could have the memory of simple, generously-proportioned food served by smiling staff.

We had the ribs - bravely advertised as ""the best ribs in town"" - and were not disappointed.  Our small sample size precludes confirming they're the best ribs in Winnipeg, but brothers and sisters, they were EXCELLENT ribs - tangy, fall off the bone masterpiece work.  Lots of flavour, lots of volume.  Ribs are very rich.  Lots of tasty fat.  A few ribs are a LOT of ribs.  Show up hungry, don't fill up on the buns, and when the ribs show up tuck in like Fred Flintstone and go HARD.  Well worth the money.

Vegetarian options are, ha ha, ha HA HA HA HA ""limited"".  If you came to a rib place for the salads, you done messed up. :)"
Silver Heights Restaurant & Lounge,Steakhouses,"2169 Portage Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3J 0L7 Canada",MB,49.8770034,-97.238833,4,"I joined my friends for an evening at the lounge, where we were greeted by an exceptional waitress. The ambiance transported me to a charming European bar, enhancing the overall experience. While the menu boasted an extensive selection, I found the prices to be slightly higher than my personal preference. Opting for the prime rib, I discovered that it fell short of the high standards I typically associate with renowned establishments like The Keg. This aspect was somewhat disappointing, particularly considering the comparable prices. However, I must emphasize that a lower price point would have greatly contributed to my overall satisfaction."
Silver Heights Restaurant & Lounge,Steakhouses,"2169 Portage Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3J 0L7 Canada",MB,49.8770034,-97.238833,1,"Our party was 13 of us! Paid $40 for a 10 oz Steak, maybe 7 ounces! Potato was baked but had to wait way to long to get sour cream and butter! Potato was warm when I finally did get it! The Cesar salad was so small. I first thought it was a joke! I’m not even five bytes of salad and croutons were rockhard. I saw no value in this meal, there is no way there was maybe $8 dollars of food cost but the charge $40 dollars for it!
Not going back! And yes other meals were not good also! So it’s just not me!
It’s to bad because I thought it was going to be a great night out with all of my family!!"

When we visited this place, it was operating in a more a la carte style than the cart style dim sum places I am more familiar with, but that didn't deter from how good and reasonably priced the food was (this visit was over a month ago)."
Sam Po,Dim Sum,"277 Rupert Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3B 0N5 Canada",MB,49.9015818,-97.1390118,2,"Went to sampo dim sum this morning and it was not really good. The shrimp rolls were very bad, the fried calamari were just a lot of fried batter…the only thing that was good was the beef balls and the pea tips in garlic. Turnip cake was mushy and the eggplant was also not so good… I wouldn’t go again I prefer by far Kumkoon…
It was also so silent with zero ambiance and the service was also bad and you have to order with a menu for dim sum.."

Parking was free right next to building so that was good. Service was quick and good. Dim sum was good, but only thing they didn't have was the chili sauce we get in US."
Sam Po,Dim Sum,"277 Rupert Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3B 0N5 Canada",MB,49.9015818,-97.1390118,5,Very tasty dimsums! And service was also good. It was a bit dirty on the table and on the floor. But food is delicious.
Sam Po,Dim Sum,"277 Rupert Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3B 0N5 Canada",MB,49.9015818,-97.1390118,1,"My family and I frequent here often, and it is often a good experience. There were four of us and we asked if we could sit at a table that seats 6 as we order lots. There was a family of 3 sitting at a 10 person table.
The employee told us that with a rude expression on her face that it was reserved.
She then returned to give us our plates, utensils etc. and we  showed our order. We asked again if we could move because we were sitting in a tight corner table, and we ordered a lot of food. She rolled her eyes and walked away.

We sat at the new table. Our ordersheet was full and the two employees looked at us and mumbled something and walked away. They passed by us a few times, and have not asked for our order sheet. It was the first that I can recall experiencing a negative experience here as we have been regulars since the 90s. We walked out and went to Dim Sum Garden across the street. Way better service and and treatment from the get go."
Ben & Florentine,Breakfast & Brunch,"155 Scurfield Boulevard Winnipeg, MB R3Y 1L6 Canada",MB,49.8167152,-97.196208,5,"First breakfast experience in Canada and it was great.! We went mid week so it wasn’t busy. The service was friendly and helpful. It was hard to choose what to have but I landed on the Banana & Chocolate crepe which was like a 3 course meal in one..! Crispy bacon with added maple syrup, eggs, sausage and potato. Then the highlight of the dish being the banana and chocolate filled crepe. This made my stomach very happy lol. Just a note.. I ordered a coffee. I am used to ordering a large in Australia so went for the “bowl” which was the larger of the 2 sizes. They aren’t wrong. It is a bowl of coffee..! Just be thirsty.. Thanks for a great experience. Will be back next time I’m back in Winnipeg."
Ben & Florentine,Breakfast & Brunch,"155 Scurfield Boulevard Winnipeg, MB R3Y 1L6 Canada",MB,49.8167152,-97.196208,5,"This was our first time here and it was easily the best breakfast place we've tried in Winnipeg and maybe anywhere (we've traveled around the world). We enjoyed this more than The Original Pancake House and IHOP in Winnipeg. Also better than Denny's and Smitty's. We haven't tried other breakfast places in Winnipeg. TOPH and IHOP have this beat hugely in terms of atmosphere and decor, but not in food IMHO.

Our server was very busy as someone had called in sick, but she was lovely and attentive. We were there during the Saturday breakfast rush (9am) but easily found seating for 4 and our food came out incredibly quick.

My meal (the first picture) was sooooo delicious and unique. The Old-fashioned Ham & Cheese Curds Skillet. It was described as: ""Shredded old-fashioned ham, mixed peppers, red onions and cheese curds. Covered with a mix of Hollandaise sauce and pure maple syrup.""

Ohhh it was good. Not remotely healthy but fun for every now and then. Our entire party thoroughly enjoyed their meals and we will return."
Ben & Florentine,Breakfast & Brunch,"155 Scurfield Boulevard Winnipeg, MB R3Y 1L6 Canada",MB,49.8167152,-97.196208,5,"My first time visiting Ben & Florentine on Kenaston.  The service was awesome, the breakfast options varied and delicious, spacious and clean environment and very good covid measures in place.  The only thing I would have liked was if my coffee was served in a tea mug that was warm because hot coffee in a cold mug makes your coffee cold before two sips.  Prices for breakfast items range between $12.95 to 17.95 approximately."
Ben & Florentine,Breakfast & Brunch,"155 Scurfield Boulevard Winnipeg, MB R3Y 1L6 Canada",MB,49.8167152,-97.196208,1,"My sister and I were not impressed by the cleanliness of the food we were serviced. (Both were on our cantaloupes and eggs).

This has not happened to me before and I have been coming to this location often. Not entirely sure if it is someone’s dog hair or  improper wear of hair nets.

I don’t recommended to go to this location."
Ben & Florentine,Breakfast & Brunch,"155 Scurfield Boulevard Winnipeg, MB R3Y 1L6 Canada",MB,49.8167152,-97.196208,5,Incredible eggs benedict! They have many different options to choose from. Their hollandaise sauce is spot on. Their BBQ version is slightly spicy with with meaty toppings. I wasn’t a huge fan of the goat cheese but it went well with the rest of the flavours. Their eggs Benedict also comes with a good portion of hash browns and fruit. I ordered a side of Crispy French Toast & Caramelized Apples which was very large. The topping was like apple pie filling with almonds. Very tasty… Their service great as well. Server was very attentive and polite. We also preferred a booth and appreciate how they made that happen. Will definitely be going back!
Confusion Corner Drinks + Food,Bars,"500 Corydon Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3L 0P1 Canada",MB,49.8739172,-97.1434241,5,"The food was the highlight of the experience, whereas some of the servers seemed to be new to the serving world, but were kind all the same.  One can simply tell when there is an experienced server vs when they're new; we found ourselves waiting for things like water refills and more drinks.
They also didn't have garlic bread available.. which I found almost shocking.    It's like a restaurant staple.. how do you not serve garlic bread?
In any case, the food wait was to be expected, and well worth it;  my partner and I absolutely loved the bruschetta, I had a cup of French onion soup, the steak sandwich and he had one of their burgers, all of which was absolutely fantastic.

During another visit, I tried their chicken tenders which are easily the best I have ever had.  And their parmesan fries are delectable."

Confusion Corner Drinks + Food,Bars,"500 Corydon Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3L 0P1 Canada",MB,49.8739172,-97.1434241,5,"Food was great, I had tacos and my friend chicken finger (portion was a good size). Service was fine, fairly quick as well. I think I like interior better before the renovation, unfortunately it lost the vibe and looks more like a bistro now. I think the wall behind the bar was making the space look bigger. Anyhow, good location, enough parking and good food, so what else one needs? :)"

I came in about 7:30 and the bar staff spent more time talking to co-workers who were getting off shift than checking back with me, my meal, and drink.  All good though, overall very good meal, chill vibe.  I'd come back.  I'm sure service is usually good."

Will not be waiting that long to go again, it’s fantastic!! The food is delicious. Prices are very reasonable with large portions. Our food came out very fast and it was hot and fresh upon arrival. Friendly staff and busy right up to closing. Go early, they close at 2 pm. I can’t wait to go back again. The yam hash mix with the Vegan Heaven Breakfast is to die for!!"

Staffs are nice and fast. This is a small family-owned restaurant so I might give them another chance to support their business and if you never try, you should come and give them a chance, I didn't like their food but you might still like it."

For a lighter fare, I suggest trying the cheese blintzes. On my second visit, I was a little more hungry and tackled the salami mix. Oh the salami was delicious. Attentive service on both occasions with pretty quick service even when busy. Busy place so you may have to wait (well worth it) Definitely recommend"
Falafel Place,Falafel,"1101 Corydon Ave Winnipeg, MB R3M 0X3 Canada",MB,49.8662341,-97.1676906,3,"Food was fantastic.  Glasses were dirty and the clean replacements didn't smell that great. 5 for food, 1 for cleanliness.

Update. Went again after a long hiatus. It was much cleaner this time, the food was still amazing, but the wait time to get the food was really pronounced. I'd say the 3* rating holds. Food is still a 5 tho, if you've got the time! The breakfast brisket is divine."
Falafel Place,Falafel,"1101 Corydon Ave Winnipeg, MB R3M 0X3 Canada",MB,49.8662341,-97.1676906,4,"“It was okay.” Was the consensus for each of our party for breakfast. I like that it’s local. Potato Pancakes are great as is the house hot sauce.
Welcome Service is good but turned mediocre after food arrived. Coffee cups are very small- only got a half-cup refill and they never came back or checked in after food arrived.
Eggs and bacon were blackened- presumably from a dirty grill with burned grease. Bacon was very dried out. Almost as if it were precooked and put back on the grill. Falafel Balls were good but are much smaller than their early days.
Water tastes odd-like well water. No ice.
They don’t give you an itemized receipt-only the total owed at the til."
Kazoku,Sushi Bars,"30-2583 Pembina hwy Winnipeg, MB R3T Canada",MB,49.7988295,-97.1577728,4,"Second time here and came based off a recommendation. The ramen itself- spicy fried chicken ramen 4.5/5 (was good and spicy!!, the fried chicken was good but obviously gets soggy really quickly) and 5/5 for the black garlic tonkatsu. We got seated very quickly, and service was good but we never did get our waters refilled- it was fairly busy but we ended up calling them over several times near the end- nothing horrible but I think filling of water should be expected. Takoyaki was very good and served quickly.

Sushi is pretty pricey but looked well made!

However, we would probably come back on a Tuesday because they have specials where ramen is 12.95!"
Kazoku,Sushi Bars,"30-2583 Pembina hwy Winnipeg, MB R3T Canada",MB,49.7988295,-97.1577728,4,Fabulous hangover cure. As you can see I completely devoured my bowl of Raman. Broth was great.  The pork was was ok. But I’m not complaining. The chicken was tender and juicy. The egg was not the right Color but still tasted great.
Kazoku,Sushi Bars,"30-2583 Pembina hwy Winnipeg, MB R3T Canada",MB,49.7988295,-97.1577728,4,"I got the Tonkatsu ramen and spicy salmon roll. I loved the pork slices, but the rest wasn't anything to write home about. Loved the service and overall atmosphere though!"

Frenchway Cafe,French,"238 Lilac Street Winnipeg, MB R3M 2T3 Canada",MB,49.8697824,-97.1576754,5,"Everything I had was so good with good price. I had Pharaoh's Vacation and Opera cake. The plate is so filling and filled with loads of veggies!  Hummus was little bit salty but it perfectly matched with eggs and garlic bread.

Opera cake was beyond my expectations! I thought it would be too sweet  to me but it had perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness. And it was so creamy!

I got raspberry cheese brownie for my kids, they loved it too.
I would definitely go back again as I would love to try out crepes, croissant and more.

Staff are so friendly and approachable :)"
Frenchway Cafe,French,"238 Lilac Street Winnipeg, MB R3M 2T3 Canada",MB,49.8697824,-97.1576754,5,"I went for the first time in November, then went back three days later to order the exact same meal because I could NOT stop thinking about how delicious it was. Everything I’ve tried since has been incredible!

The staff I’ve engaged with have all been so lovely and friendly, even when they’re incredibly busy. The sweets and pastries are fantastic and it’s so fun to look at them all in the display at the counter!

I love the variety of art that’s on display, and for sale!! It’s very fun to look at the pieces while enjoying your meal, it all felt creative and interesting. Lots of good conversation pieces, I really loved that aspect of the physical space itself.

They also collect donations for local women’s centres (or possibly women’s shelters specifically, I can’t remember). I asked someone behind the counter about where the donations go since they didn’t have a specific location listed, and they explained that they distribute donations to several resources in the area. It’s great to see a local business taking that initiative and very cool that staff are engaged with it enough that they can answer questions and have a conversation about it, I really appreciated that.

Can’t wait to go back again soon!"
Frenchway Cafe,French,"238 Lilac Street Winnipeg, MB R3M 2T3 Canada",MB,49.8697824,-97.1576754,5,"Cute little cafe just off Corydon. There was lots of seating and parking right beside the building. I tried the Spec-taco-lar burger (bean burger) which was really good. The combination of flavors worked well. I also tried the fruit tart which was okay, but the tart shell was overcooked and hard. Definitely would come back here to grab a bite and coffee with a friend."

Frenchway Cafe,French,"238 Lilac Street Winnipeg, MB R3M 2T3 Canada",MB,49.8697824,-97.1576754,3,"I love the food here, but I wouldn't describe the dine-in experience as welcoming or friendly.

For example, when I walked in with a friend today, there were at least three people working the front with no customers in line, and they didn't even glance at us. Unsure what to do, we decided to wait by the entrance to check out the hot menu (the only signage posted by the entrance). When my friend I were finally acknowledged, it was to tersely inform us that the kitchen was closed. We chose to eat elsewhere."
Kimchi Sushi,Korean,"1270 Pembina Highway Winnipeg, MB R3T 2B1 Canada",MB,49.8429456,-97.1527907,3,"We went there to see some good photos and reviews to try their Kimchi fried rice and udon. But we were very disappointed with the taste, quantity and the price but the atmosphere and the staff was very good and polite. Wasn’t happy with their food taste and quantity at all. We also ordered Sushi (which was so good), but spent $50 with tips on those foods wasn’t a great choice for us to do as we were very hungry after the day of hiking."

Kimchi Sushi,Korean,"1270 Pembina Highway Winnipeg, MB R3T 2B1 Canada",MB,49.8429456,-97.1527907,3,"Visited on a whim as I was walking back to my hotel. I was alone and got seated in a totally separate room from all of the other diners and in the corner, it was fine but I just thought it was a bit strange. My “19oz” draft pint as stated on the menu was more like a sad 12oz. I ordered the sashimi salad and some steamed rice. “Assorted” sashimi is a stretch when you only include 2 kinds of fish. The amount of fish was disappointing. It looked like they took 2 pieces of sashimi MAX, and cut them into tiny cubes and spread them out all over the salad. Flavour was good, but the salad was merely empty, nothing but spring mix, dressing, the sad portion of fish, and a few pieces of cubed mango that was starting to go bad. Dumping my entire bowl of rice on the salad honestly saved it. However, the server was excellent and he was very polite, he did ask if I enjoyed the food and everything was ok. Which again, the flavour was good, and honestly I hadn’t eaten all day so I wasn’t going to complain about something I finished. But I do think the portion of fish was sad."
Kimchi Sushi,Korean,"1270 Pembina Highway Winnipeg, MB R3T 2B1 Canada",MB,49.8429456,-97.1527907,5,"Located on Pembina near Jubilee, this sushi place has quite an easy excess with tons of parking spots. The interior is beautiful and has dividers between tables to give you more private dining experience. The menu is really big and has quite a lot of selections for fish and rolls. Also has specialty section and korean food. We didn't get to try to Korean food but the sushi we ordered was very fresh and delicious. They serve fresh oysters here as well which were amazing! Definitely order a house hot sake!!"

I feel like my expectations for the food was higher based on the pictures. The pie flight I ordered was good, but not really spectacular. We also ordered a side of the meatballs wrapped in puff pastry and they were a bit on the bland side for my taste. It looked like it was missing parsley or some sort of garnish based on one other picture I saw. I do like the underground, British decor and the service was pretty average. Convenient place to get food if you're staying at the hotel though."

Elephant & Castle,British,"350 St Mary Ave Winnipeg, MB R3C 3J2 Canada",MB,49.8900047,-97.1437883,3,"This was the first restaurant I ate at when I visited Winnipeg. I stayed at the Delta Hotel Marriott and I liked the convenience that it was right next door to the hotel.

[VIBE]
The vibe of the pub was a British underground space and pretty spacious at the time I went, which was late dinner.
[SERVICE]
A little slow and not busy at all. I went late evening so there weren't many servers around that time.
[FOOD]
The Sunday Roast - Turned out to be a huge meal for one. It came with a puff pastry on top, mash, long beans and cooked carrots, and some thin slices of roast beef. It wasn't bad for the price point!

Mini-Sausage Rolls - This one was probably my favorite. It seemed to have missed it's garnish in another review I saw, but other than that, it was the sauce which made it tasty. It came with a chutney like sweet sauce to dip the rolls in. It had a decent portion to share between 2-3 people.

The Wee Pie Flight - This was small enough to taste test each of the savory pies, but I didn't find anything too special with them.

Overall, food was not bad for a late night snack or meal! I would go again just for the sausage rolls. I found them addicting.

I just came in for an after work conference glass of wine. JUST made it in time to order a happy hour glass of wine. Happy hour is until 6:00 pm unlike BC.Thank you Braydon for the quick pleasant service. Back to the honey dill sauce... it was sweet, tasty with just the right creaminess.

Not very happy how things were handled and they flat out lied to me on the phone saying they washed their vegetables but feel free to look at the picture below. There is still the sticker on the red pepper which has just been cut into slices and served into my bowl. Not only does that mean they didn't take the plastic sticker off but they probably didn't wash their vegetables. Sadly I can't find the remainder of the sticker which means I probably ate it....

They have something for everyone! Highly recommend checking them out, you won't regret it 😉 👌"
Sushi Cushi,Japanese,"1045 St James Street Unit - K Winnipeg, MB R3H Canada",MB,49.8951403,-97.1984924,5,"Delicious flavors at a reasonable price, the service time is acceptable and the attention is very good.

Definitely goes on my favorites list and we will be back soon"
Sushi Cushi,Japanese,"1045 St James Street Unit - K Winnipeg, MB R3H Canada",MB,49.8951403,-97.1984924,1,"Ordered after reading the good reviews and unfortunately it was the worst sushi I’ve ever had in my life…The rice was crispy either not well cooked or old one of the two. The rolls were not properly rolled and would break every time we tried to eat. The shrimp had shell residues in the roll… the soya came in small bag packs and was so salty non edible. The ginger tasted like plastic, not exaggerating. I do not recommend for take-out."
Sushi Cushi,Japanese,"1045 St James Street Unit - K Winnipeg, MB R3H Canada",MB,49.8951403,-97.1984924,5,Sushi is fairly priced. Tastes delicious. It has always been busy when we came to visit but service is prompt.

This one came highly recommended per reviews. Originally wanted to try Hoagie Boyz but they were closed on Monday. I’m glad they were because I would’ve missed out on one of the best places I’ve been to. I couldn’t decide which sandwich to get and I saw them putting the cheese sauce on a sandwich they were making for someone else. Can’t say no to cheese sauce. That turned out to be the Philly sandwich! I was intrigued by the smoked Buffalo chicken so I got both. One for lunch one for later.

Exceptional flavour. The bread was so soft and fresh. Unbelievable. A little pricy but you get what you pay for. I opted for their jalapeño Mac n cheese. It was alright. Their coleslaw was outta world. Hella fresh and packed with flavour. When I’m in Winnipeg again I’m definitely stopping by again."
King + Bannatyne,Sandwiches,"100 King Street Unit D Winnipeg, MB R3B 0P6 Canada",MB,49.8981276,-97.1415202,3,"$15 for a small sandwich? OK better be the best sandwich ever... Sadly, it was not.
King + Bannatyne has limited menu options and it's over-priced. I got the roast sweet potato + hummus— disappointing. They didn't make it properly.
Really good customer service though!!"
King + Bannatyne,Sandwiches,"100 King Street Unit D Winnipeg, MB R3B 0P6 Canada",MB,49.8981276,-97.1415202,3,Brisket Sammich was weak on meat (but tasty). Tomato soup was good. You can use all that extra bread for dunking. Staff courteous but not overly helpful. Pricey.
King + Bannatyne,Sandwiches,"100 King Street Unit D Winnipeg, MB R3B 0P6 Canada",MB,49.8981276,-97.1415202,3,"The atmosphere is great. The bread to filling ratio of the sandwich is not. Too much bread not enough meat/veggies especially considering the price. Side potato salad was good.

They don't serve their sandwiches on plates. This leads to quite a mess as you eat since the fixings fall/roll right off the boards. Not ideal when you need to look professional after lunch."
King + Bannatyne,Sandwiches,"100 King Street Unit D Winnipeg, MB R3B 0P6 Canada",MB,49.8981276,-97.1415202,5,"Great staff and great sandwich.
Didn’t have their regular sandwich bread avail so they made mine on a Kaiser bun and it was still so so good.
Highly recommend the Carolina bbq sandwich. Each sando approx $16, all sides extra.

Very disappointed"

What a scam! I won’t be going back and I strongly do not recommended anyone to support this place.  I phoned in and spoke with the owner regarding to the food portion we paid for, wow the owner admit their portion is small and this is how it is she said. ZERO star for this place. SCAM!!!"

My families favorites are the sour cabbage and pork noodle soup and the shrimp pancake?
I don't know if that's it's name because they just order it when we go. I didn't look at the menu.

They also have bubble tea. In the past they did not use a powder and used real whipping cream, which made it stand out for me."
Hsieh Family Restaurant,Taiwanese,"230 Dalhousie Drive Winnipeg, MB R3T 2Z1 Canada",MB,49.7964636,-97.1478731,1,The food was so tasteless and soupy. We ordered a stir vegetables and stir fried lamb with cumin&onions. Looks like the vegetables was boiled and put in some stock and the lamb was boiled and sautéed with onions in a stock!! Food portion is very small as well. We called to let them know and the owner just said they are sorry! Really bad experience overall!!!!

I had the Cauliflower Pakora Burger with Fries and it was DELICIOUS! Smashing it before eating is a must, it’s huge and messy but worth it. We all LOVED our meals and we can’t wait to go back and try more menu items. Oh and the cake… homemade that day and YUM! HIGHly recommend getting dessert."

Family Easter brunch for eight was easily accommodated (no one wanted to cook 😂). we had our stretchy pants on and were looking forward to the eats from others who highly recommended Oakwood. Our table had the Crown burger with fries, Feta, Tomato and Avo eggs benny, chicken chorizo waffles, French toast patty melt and bacon and eggs breakfast. All plates demolished! Delicious and large portions. Coffee was really good I think it is Bob Marley Blue Mountain. Not sure why it took me forever to eat here. Must add to your casual diner eats list. Most definitely will be back. Licensed, with mimosas or breakfast beers if that tickles your fancy. They also sell pre-made meals to go."

My boyfriend and I got the Salmon dill benny and Johan’s club. I was expecting to taste a bit more of the dill in the dill hollandaise but other than that, it’s a solid benny. My boyfriend said the club was solid too.

Will be back to try other stuff in the future!"

Pizzeria Gusto,Pizza,"404 Academy Road Winnipeg, MB R3N 0B8 Canada",MB,49.8735972,-97.183366,4,"Great Neapolitan style pizza. Bright and modernly designed dinning room. Seating at the bar, pizza bar, window, and patio. We had the Don which was all meat no veg (husband staple) and the Rustica (no meat all veg). They have about 4 vegetarian pizza options but you can always omit the meat on any pizza. Beer menu is small (sorry beer lovers), cocktail menu had about 8 options, with a focus an a larger wine menu.
If you have a love for the za and want an upscale pizza dinning experience. This would be your jam. Highly recommend making a rezo during prime time."

I had one of my best-ever Caesar salads!  And the Margherita pizza was very tasty ..... and straight from the wood-burning pizza ovens.

And of course we had a few bottles of red wine from their terrific wine list.

Although the prices are a smidge higher, the delicious meal and ambience are well worth the cost.

This restaurant is wheel-chair accessible and has a great outdoor patio.  It is also LGBTQ friendly.

Try it!  You will like it!"

The sushi was delicious. Combination of sushi mix is just right for family(with child). I am so happy to find out this nice sushi take out place in Winnipeg. Staffs are also very friendly. If you want to taste decent quality of sushi with good price in winnipeg, this is the right place. Additionally, Fried spring rolls were exceptionally crisp and warm!"
Ta.Ke Sushi Take-Out,Sushi Bars,"1235 Pembina Highway Winnipeg, MB R3T 2A9 Canada",MB,49.8433965,-97.1539551,2,Kind of average sushi flavor.  It’s what you get everywhere. The rice was flavorless and the fish was not great.  I am not in love. Very average and can’t eat inside. Not worth it.
Ta.Ke Sushi Take-Out,Sushi Bars,"1235 Pembina Highway Winnipeg, MB R3T 2A9 Canada",MB,49.8433965,-97.1539551,4,"I came here for dinner and ordered Alaska roll, shrimp tempura roll, and salmon sashimi. I opened the box and had them immediately when I return to my car. As a sushi chef who had 2 years experience, I would say the experience is good(compare to the price). I feel everything I ordered worth the money I paid(except the miso soup). If you are looking for a sushi place where you spent little but can get a good portion of sushi(the quality is above the average), maybe give it try. Suggestion: removing the tail crust of shrimp when you guys make the shrimp tempura roll. I know it looks good but uneatable."
Naru Sushi,Japanese,"159 Osborne Street Winnipeg, MB R3L 1Y7 Canada",MB,49.8772354,-97.1444616,5,"The go-to place in Winnipeg for sushi. The Naru Roll is the best sushi roll I've ever eaten. Creamy house sauce, fish eggs, crispy pawn. YUM.
The sushi boats are highly recommended for shareables. The nigiri is fresh and tasty. Cheap drinks are the cherry on top. Service is fast. Highly recommend."
Naru Sushi,Japanese,"159 Osborne Street Winnipeg, MB R3L 1Y7 Canada",MB,49.8772354,-97.1444616,5,"Top 3 in Winnipeg! Atmosphere is great and the sushi is very high quality, fresh and fairly priced.

In the last 5 years, it has gone downhill and tonight was my final visit. Do not waste your time eating their less than fresh fish and dealing with the alarmingly rude staff. Walk 5 minutes away to Akindo Sushi bistro where you will have the most delicious food and kind servers. Zero stars."

Carnaval Brazilian BBQ,Barbeque,"270 Waterfront Drive Winnipeg, MB R3B 0L4 Canada",MB,49.8976151,-97.1336141,5,"What a cool experience!
We did the upstairs dining area where it’s all you can eat.  Basically you order sides (I loved the cheese balls), and then someone comes around with a giant skewer of meat and offers it to you. As long as your card is green they’ll keep coming with various cuts on repeat. Turn your card to red when you need a break or are done. Flip as desired.
The meat was cooked to perfection and I honestly enjoyed it so much.
You get some pretty tasty dipping sauces to try as well.
For dessert I tried the cheesecake and I did not like that- it tasted like coconut but was supposed to be berry?

Expensive but for the unique experience and food quality, it was fun and worth it."
Carnaval Brazilian BBQ,Barbeque,"270 Waterfront Drive Winnipeg, MB R3B 0L4 Canada",MB,49.8976151,-97.1336141,5,"The food was so good. I even got to try lamb for the first time, and it was really good. Only draw back is because of the open ceiling concept it makes voices travel a lot . It was hard at times to carry a conversation because of the echoing of the dining area, and the restaurant wasn't that busy.
Prices are a tad high, $14.00 for drink. The meal ranges from $49.00 - $70.00 per person. Did give a senior discount, which was nice.
It's an experience for some special fine dining.
Once again, awesome service and staff."

Tons of meat selections that are brought and carved at your table. Lots of sides to choose from. Did find the food quite salty, but the accompanying drinks were delightful! You need to try the one in the pineapple. The price for the dinner all you can eat is a little steep, but definitely an experience you should have if you`re going anyway. There is a separate menu for downstairs that includes individual items."

I would still go here again though to try other stuff on the menu. They have really cool ideas for drinks. I love the Zelda themed drinks, they were adorable. But there was a mix up when I tried to order the apricot Zelda drink. On the online menu it was red, but when I received it, the drink was blue which caused some confusion, hopefully that gets fixed in their menu. Overall I enjoyed my visit here."
Dwarf No Cachette Cafe & Gift,Japanese,"157 Provencher Boulevard Winnipeg, MB R2H 0G2 Canada",MB,49.8920144,-97.1234694,4,"Great Japanese food in St Boniface with a cute gift shop above.

The menu is extensive with many different Japanese plates to choose from. We had the Green Onion & Sesame Sauce Takoyaki, Spicy Chicken Katsu Yakisoba, and Teriyaki Mayo Karaage Don. The highlight was the spicy chicken katsu, the sauce was excellent and the breading was just the right amount of crispy.

The portion sizes were large and ended up taking enough home another full meal. The prices were affordable, especially given the amount of food. For two people, it would be reasonable to share one appetizer and one main dish.

The staff were very friendly and the food was served impressively fast. The decor is an eclectic mix and the furniture was a bit uncomfortable; however, this was not an issue. We enjoyed taking a walk through the gift shop upstairs after our dinner.

We look forward to returning to Dwarf no Cachette to try more of their menu, including their ramen and okinomoyaki. Based on our first experience, we recommend it!"
Dwarf No Cachette Cafe & Gift,Japanese,"157 Provencher Boulevard Winnipeg, MB R2H 0G2 Canada",MB,49.8920144,-97.1234694,4,"I visited this restaurant by a recommendation for Japanese Izakaya food. There were about 10 of us and was pleasantly surprised that they had room when we showed up at around 6-7pm. I made sure to call beforehand though just in case.

[VIBE]
It's a cute and quirky little restaurant featuring gnomes and dwarf decor arrangements. It was cozy inside and on the top floor, there was a local gift shop. The shop sold cute little knick-knacks from handmade jewelry, pins, to anime buttons and stickers.

[SERVICE]
The service was pretty good for having to deal with all 10 of us and we didn't have to wait too long to get seated. The only downfall was that one of the drinks we ordered didn't quite match up to the description of the menu on their website we ordered from. Some of the food items or specials on the website were not on the menu either but were still available to order.

[FOOD]
What we were intentionally drawn with by choosing to eat at this restaurant were the playful drinks. The Zelda themed drinks were fun and we would have no idea about these drinks if not for checking the website.

Onigiri Combo (Takoyaki) - 3 choices of onigiri which I chose 1.tuna mayo, 2. karage, 3. shrimp tempura and it came with a miso soup and 6 pieces of regular takoyaki. The onigiris were HUGE and I ended up only being able to finish one and taking the rest home to go. The takoyaki came out with floating pieces of the bonito flakes waving in the air, as expected. The miso soup was very rich in flavor and I don't think I ever had sesame in miso soup before.

[DRINKS]
Milkshake Shingen-mochi with Black Sugar Syrup - This drink is very delicious and sweet with the black sugar syrup and chewy mochis.

Master Sword - Cold sake, Calpico, and club soda mix with a master sword iced jelly. The master sword jelly gets floppy pretty quickly when left out too long, so it's best to take the pics quick and then stir the drink with the master sword.

Hearty Elixir - Peach Redbull and red coloring. It's a tangy and pretty refreshing drink for the summer.

Blue Jelly Sake Soda - I found the blue jelly was fun to stir around in my drink, but the blue jelly itself tasted pretty bland and not that great with the sake. It's nice for photos only.

Apple Popping Boba Sake - This was an alright tasting drink and it only made it better with the popping bobas! The light hitting the bobas made the drink look radioactive and was fun to take pics of.

I would go here again just to try their other dishes. Everything looked and sounded so good, we all had trouble choosing what to get!

Quite a varied menu of Japanese dishes anywhere from ramen, don buri, curry rice, yakisoba and the gamut of appetizers. The food portions were on the more plentiful side.

On a side note, they had big portions of their ramen. The broth was good but it wasn’t the best in my opinion."

Cafe Carlo,Canadian (New),"243 Lilac Street Winnipeg, MB R3M 2S2 Canada",MB,49.8698985,-97.1571276,4,"Our server (apologies for the forgotten name) was absolutely fantastic! Attentive, accommodating, and impressively knowledgeable about the menu and pairings.

The bruschetta appetizer was a delightful 10/10, bursting with flavor! We couldn't resist trying the famous Fett Chile, a unique creation of Cafe Carlo, along with the Meaty Penne. Despite the warning of spiciness, these dishes didn't set our tongues on fire.

While the Meaty Penne was a bit saucy and lacked some flavor to my personal preference, the sausages in both pasta dishes were slightly firm. Regrettably, the main dishes didn't quite live up to expectations considering the price.

The atmosphere was elegant with dim lighting, and each table was beautifully set with forks, knives, and glassware.

Kudos to our server for sharing info about the cool artwork for sale and the talented artist behind them. By the way, that Alicia Keys piece? Mind-blowing!

Recommendations: try the Bruschetta and Fett Chile!"
Cafe Carlo,Canadian (New),"243 Lilac Street Winnipeg, MB R3M 2S2 Canada",MB,49.8698985,-97.1571276,4,"Great place, lovely ambiance, friendly and professional staff. Would recommend the Fett Chile (without sausages) as the sausage taste could dominate and ruin the dish, and the Pappardelle is just heavenly!"
The Don Restaurant,Breakfast & Brunch,"120 Donald Street Suite 2 Winnipeg, MB R3C 4G2 Canada",MB,49.8883176,-97.1409516,1,"What a disappointing experience. 40 minutes to get an omelette and corned beef hash, and when breakfast comes it's unsalted, bland, and with a genuine slice of Kraft cheese on the egg. Cold toast, boiled tasteless potato, and dry eggs.

The service is also brutal. We waited 20 minutes for our server to even acknowledge we were sitting at the table, and then another 40 for our food to arrive. Barely interested staff providing a truly disengaged and uninspired experience. I'll never be back, and I recommend the place to nobody."

The Benedict felt incomplete, like it was missing some fruits or vegetables on the side, but it was a pretty decent meal.

Resto Gare Bistro,French,"630 Des Meurons Street Winnipeg, MB R2H 2P9 Canada",MB,49.8932576,-97.1121923,5,"This place was a great experience for a small group. I feel as though 2-4 people would be the ideal amount, especially if you’re looking for seating in the train. It would get a little cramped for space otherwise. Great food, well worth the price. The only criticism would be the servers and staff, they could have been more hospitable, but we came in on a very busy evening so its justified. I wish they had live jazz on more nights throughout the week, I feel as though that’d be a great addition. Got the beef bourguignon, and escargot, would highly recommend. Would gladly come back and try out different items on their menu."

The food that was got was okay but not as good as I remember, and extremely expensive now compared to a few years ago. Did enjoy the crazy 88 roll and tempura prawns, but some of the others missed the mark."

I can't say many bad things about it - still probably the best sushi in Winnipeg - but the quality does seem to have gone generally down over the years.
.
They've also removed some of the best items from the menu, like the sushi pizza and the prairie fire roll.
.
It's also *very* expensive. If it wasn't for the nostalgia factor I'd probably rate lower - but yeah, still a great place worth visiting."

The rolls themselves had WAY too much rice. They were so big, hardly taste anything else, just dense rice. The tempura flakes were hard and over cooked. Hurt to chew, as they were kinda rock hard. Should be light and fluffy.
Asked for extra soy sauce. See photo to see what they consider extra soy sauce. Two tiny cups 1/4 full. Might as well just filler one half full……."

The guy at the front and answering the phone does no good for this business. All 3 rolls were loaded with rice lacking the fish. Yokohama roll was deep fried shrimp with some avocado and cucumbers very little salmon or tuna. Called to let them know, he said they have a machine to roll, pretty sure the machine doesn’t add the fish. Don’t waste your money."

If you can’t use the numbers to place the orders then remove the numbers maybe 🤔
Used to come here all the time ultimately told him I’ll maybe call back but after that interaction I’m now going to place an order with a different sushi place in Osborne. I’ll also not be recommending this place to me staff anymore either"

The place is well connected by public transport and has ample parking space outside. It's located at Shaw Park. A day of a baseball match you can enjoy the match and have lunch with family and friends. You can take the elevator to reach the 3rd floor where it's located. But yeah, you need to wait for a while to get into the elevator during rush hours. The ambiance inside the restaurant is extraordinary. The staff is very approachable and friendly. The price in the restaurant is decent among all other contemporaries. I tasted the non veg thali, the portion was enough for a single person. The mango lassi was absolutely delicious. Would highly recommend this place for authentic Indian food."

Various choices, love Indian restaurants for their vegan options and this one didn't disappoint. The food was divine, even after I reheated my leftovers at home.
The servers were friendly and quick, the food didn't take long at all. The place is a bit loud inside and outside. Outside you get to watch a game if one is on. Inside the staff may have been a bit overwhelmed at the time, there was a food spill that wasn't cleaned for an extended period and the smoke from the kitchen irritated my throat when I passed too close.
All in all a good restaurant experience."

As a vegetarian, my wife often faces challenges finding restaurants that provide both delectable flavors and affordability, but Nuburger exceeded her expectations on both fronts.

Nuburger's commitment to catering to vegetarians is commendable. Their diverse range of veggie burgers truly stood out. My wife had previously visited Nuburger and loved it, so we decided to give it a try together. I ordered a traditional burger, which was nothing short of fantastic. The patty was perfectly cooked, juicy, and packed with flavor. The accompanying toppings and condiments were thoughtfully selected, adding a delightful harmony to the overall experience."

We ordered 2 dishes- both 5/10 heat.  Turned out it was good for my husband but a little too high for me - would go with level 3 or 4 next time.  Our friends had a level 7 for one of theirs.  Beef basil and deep fried fish were our 2 orders.  We had a calamari appetizer which was very good.  Great service and friendly staff.  Good place for Laotian and Thai food.

They offered a spice scale of 1 to 10.  We had a 5 and it was spicy, my friends had a very spicy 8 and enjoyed the heat that it was.
We had the beef and basil, a fish dish and calamari.

Although the decor is in need of an update (paint peeling off the walls, old tables and chairs) I was more interested in the food and that did not disappoint. We had the coconut shrimp as an appetizer and the large green curry soup with a side of rice as well as the pad nut. The shrimp was good in fact so good we ate it before I thought of taking a picture. The soup was excellent! A very generous portion full of vegetables and chicken. We selected spice level 5 and it was fine for me however my lunch partner  fond it very spicy so be aware of that. We had to pack up the pad nut but when I finally got to it it was delicious. Very good sauce, lots of veggies another excellent choice. The restaurant has some parking but with the other businesses around it can be tough to find a spot."

Delicious Vegetarian Restaurant,Vegetarian,"1467 Pembina Highway Winnipeg, MB R3T 2C5 Canada",MB,49.836016,-97.1509978,5,"If you love Chinese, look no further. Absolutely scrumptious Chinese food, all 100% vegetarian and full of flavour. Delicious has been around for a long time and they have consistently delivered high quality and great tasting food that comes in good serving size and won’t break the bank. The customer service is very good and personalized just as it comes with small businesses. I asked lots of questions before placing my order and they answered patiently and explained everything. The items I tried (pictured) are item#6: wonton in chillie garlic sauce; 25: deep fried mushrooms with spicy salt; 31: sweet and sour gluten balls; 70: Hong Kong style chow mein and vegetable fried rice.
I ordered the HK chowmein because the google pictures made it look like the Cantonese soy sauce chowmein and I was not disappointed. Absolutely delicious. The highlight of my order were the mounds of deep fried crispy mushrooms. They come piled high and are addictive. Overall very happy with my order and will be back to try more. The only regret I have is that I forgot to ask for a copy of takeout menu for next time.

Something to be aware of: They are only offering takeout at the moment, must be wearing mask when going to pickup and they only accept Visa (CC) or cash.  Debit and MasterCard are not accepted."

The folks that work here are lovely and kind. Their deep fried “eel” is what made me like mushrooms."

They say vegetarian but all the dishes are vegan.

Deep Fried mushrooms - 5 🌟  wonderful flavor on them. Texture was a bit thicker and chewier than I would like, but some might enjoy it

""Beef"" with ginger and green onions 4 🌟 - when I brought the leftovers to my friend he questioned if it was actual beef. This was my least favorite dish however out of what we tried

Hot and sour soup 4 🌟 - it was very good, but I didn't prefer how sweet it was. If the added sweetness wasn't there I would have done a 5

Tofu with peanut sauce 5 🌟 - I was but expecting to like this as much as I did.

They had a decaf tea that was roasted rice and ginger which was very pleasant. It is a hint of ginger flavoring.

Service was excellent 5 🌟 with the server on top of the leftovers and the bill.

The interior is much slicker looking then what I remember. It is modern and does not resemble your typical Chinese restaurant.
It is located right on pembina, near the Stella's. Parking is available on the street and side streets.

Come on guys, this is not a chicken soup. This looks like chicken curry cooked with just oil.
Don’t you know what soup looks like🤦🏻‍♂️??
When I complained, the lady was so arrogant and said this is our style. WTH"

We used to eat here all the time before Covid but have not had their food for a couple of years. Not sure if ownership has changed or different staff is cooking the dishes but food was lacking flavour and creaminess that you usually get, almost as if it was watered down? We will have to seek out a new Indian food restaurant."
Sizzling Dhaba,Indian,"628A St Anne's Rd Winnipeg, MB R2C 0A1 Canada",MB,49.8305169,-97.0882484,1,"I had ordered 24 samosas from this restaurant and they were uncooked. When I tried to tell them they are uncooked, they did not accept and started quarrelling with us. This was very unprofessional. I was talking to that lady there and all of a sudden a guy came and started arguing. I had guests to attend and they refused to refund the money or deliver to my address. At first they said they will deliver but the guy pitched in who was very rude and refused to deliver. I would have given 0 rating if that was an option. Now I also doubt the hygen as the samosas were not cooked from inside and it's very unhealthy with oil getting inside and the dough stretchy and uncooked, and I doubt if it was fresh.

I completely boycott the rude and arrogant behavior of the people working there that they don't know how to talk to the customers. Sadly this was my one of the worst experience in Winnipeg.

I highly request the people who read reviews not to go to the restaurant."

We ended up having samosas and samosas plate (samosas with chick pea curry , onions,  tomatoes, and secret sauce).
Samosas were great but very filling. I like crunch more than the filling but it's personal preference.
I think restaurants shall introduce blank samosas 😃 options too to just enjoy the crunch.
It was sad experience to miss Jalebi as Master chef was on vacations and no one else dared to mess up with the recipe. May be next time. A small shop with good taste wonders."

The restaurant staff was friendly and accommodating, and the kids menu was a hit with the little ones. The baked brie was simply delicious, and the rib steak was cooked to perfection and came with some delicious roasted beets and green beans. Unfortunately, my wife wasn't happy with her sirloin, but we were pleasantly surprised when the manager went above and beyond to make it right. Overall, The Keg Restaurant is an excellent choice for special occasions and we will definitely be returning in the future."

We did have to stand and wait for about 25 minutes in order to be seated, despite having made a reservation - just something to keep in mind if you're going there on a weekend. Great service."

To the keg for steak! Consistent cook, service and ambiance. I had the classic strip loin,
Scallops for appies and billy Milner for dessert! Had a bottle of j lohr which is amazing they carry cause not many do.. food came out quickly. Steak is always cooked perfectly z Few things missed, hot sauce and steak knives which we had to ask for a second time but other than it was great!
They have a parking lot not you can park at for cheap. Reservations done online is a must as it gets packed on the weekends."

Looking for a restaurant after our tour, we discovered this little gem. Although it was very busy over lunch, the staff appeared to be a well oiled machine. From start to finish, we were very impressed with this restaurant. Judging by their clientele, they must have a lot of repeat customers. Another positive sign of a great place to eat."

Feast Cafe Bistro,Canadian (New),"587 Ellice Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3B 1Z7 Canada",MB,49.8931505,-97.1584235,5,"This was our first time at Feast. We went for lunch, and the food (Pickerel Sliders / Bison Chili) was excellent!  The portions were generous for the price paid, and the Bannock was some of the best I've had.  The service was quick but friendly, and we didn't feel rushed. The ambiance is nicer than I expected, and it feels more spacious than it actually is. Overall it was an excellent experience, and we will definitely go back to try some of the other dishes."

Had the bison ribs which were incredibly tender. Not a huge serving, but WELL worth it! Enjoy every bite! Savour it.

Wife had the Feast Bannock pizza, which was also delightful. Great bannock crust, wonderful toppings.

Looking forward to making a return and trying some other menu items!

Oh. Also, London Fogs are just great."
Feast Cafe Bistro,Canadian (New),"587 Ellice Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3B 1Z7 Canada",MB,49.8931505,-97.1584235,5,What a lovely place! I’ve never really been exposed to Indigenous Canadian food so I was really excited to try Feast Cafe. I was not disappointed…the use of Bannock for the delicious Tipi taco to the amazing Bannock pizza. It is a gorgeous little spot with lovely service too. Recommend completely!!!
Feast Cafe Bistro,Canadian (New),"587 Ellice Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3B 1Z7 Canada",MB,49.8931505,-97.1584235,5,Great food with amazing service. I had the braised bison rib and it was one of the best meals I had in Winnipeg. Sweet grass and blueberry ice cream is also great. Prices are also great.
Feast Cafe Bistro,Canadian (New),"587 Ellice Avenue Winnipeg, MB R3B 1Z7 Canada",MB,49.8931505,-97.1584235,5,"While in Winnipeg, I visited Feast Cafe Bistro. This is a unique Indigenous restaurant with amazing food.

I started off with the Butternut Squash Soup with coconut milk and a hint of ginger with corn chips. This was one of the best soups I’ve ever had! The combination was fantastic and it was very flavourful.

I then had the Slow-Roasted Rosemary Manitoba Bison, served with potato squash mash, seasonal vegetables, horseradish, gravy jus, & wild blueberry compote. It was without a doubt an outstanding dish. The bison was soft, lean, and very rich in flavour, and the combination of the mashed potatoes and the wild blueberry compote skyrocketed the flavour of the dish because it added a bit of sourness and sweetness to activate all the flavours of the mouth.

The service was outstanding and the establishment was clean. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who visits or lives in Winnipeg, Manitoba!"
Helios Restaurant,Greek,"241 St Mary's Road Winnipeg, MB R2H 1J4 Canada",MB,49.8748761,-97.1169439,4,"I had to edit this review as a lot of things I had originally posted became outdated after a month. (I was here more than once in that month since I did enjoy it) So this is an amalgamated review.

I debated between 3 and 4 on this visit, but ultimately went with a 4. The service was fine on this visit from our server. She took direction but not initiative. The food is generally good. I'm still waiting to find that dish that I have fall in love with and crave all the time.

It didn't start out well. They had a water issue, which was the same water issue that was there from a month before that I guess is still not resolved. The water is yellow. They could not serve tap water or make tea. If tea, hot water, etc is important to you, you are out of luck.

On this visit, I had brought a group of people from out of town to try Helios. Originally they had platters which were priced well for their assortment of items to try. We were told they no longer have them. They were meant for customers to try everything and get a taste of the food, but since they have been here long enough, they felt it was no longer necessary. We were disappointed to hear that as it made for great presentation and was nice to have a sampling.

Portion sizes are large for everything.

When we went originally there seemed to be 3 sizes for salads. Half salad is not the same as a starter. (Pictures below show the difference). We used the Pellegrino can to help show size. However I am unsure if they changed that since.

We went for lunch this time (the other times it was dinner)
If you order the fries with fish expect a lot of fries and only a little fish. The full serving of calamari I felt was not as good as the side that you add to your meal. Its almost the same in value, but half portions often cost more. So if you do want all that calamari go ahead, but half portions are equally fine.
The slouvaki lunches seemed to be the best value and looked well balanced.
The caviar dip this time was not as good as the first time we tried it.
Highlights was flaming cheese because... Flames. The pan is larger where the cheese is a smaller piece in the center. It comes served with pita bread.
There was a lot of dressing on our half salad and a more moderate amount (I preferred this one) on our starter, which makes me feel it can be inconsistent.

Service is standard. Some are better than others. They usually did not go out of their way, but they were friendly and did their job.
I feel like the pricing is fair for what you get.
I appreciated everything came out piping hot."
Helios Restaurant,Greek,"241 St Mary's Road Winnipeg, MB R2H 1J4 Canada",MB,49.8748761,-97.1169439,5,"First time eating here, and I was very satisfied with the experience. The two appetizers (calamari and deep fried zucchini) were served hot to our table and tasted freshly breaded. The Greek salad and garlic bread as starters were very tasty and good portion. Greek salad only had 2 black olives, but I didn't mind because I don't like them myself. The feta wasn't quite the best to me but still good.

The entrees (pork tenderloin skewers, and stuffed pepper) arrived at our table after a short wait and we're hot. The meals themselves were very tasty. The lemon potatoes were very good and a nice bite. The tenderloin was very tangy and super tender.

Overall it's a premium meal at a premium price that's well earned. We ordered 2 entrees, 2 appetizers, and a drink each and the total was 84$. Or 42$ a person. Not bad considering the quality and quantity of food we recieved. Would definitely come again, next time I'm looking for a premium dining experience."
Helios Restaurant,Greek,"241 St Mary's Road Winnipeg, MB R2H 1J4 Canada",MB,49.8748761,-97.1169439,5,"You won't be leaving hungry here!!!! Amazing food, generous portions, friendly welcoming service and great daily specials! All the appitizers are delicious, the deepfried mushrooms and pickles are heavenly and the humas is very tasty and one of the better I've had while eating out.
The Greek salad pictured with garlic bread is only a side salad, I cannot imagine a full sized one!
Two chicken breasts stone cooked with spinach and feta.
Stuffed pepper with spiced ground beef, both come with lemon potatoes, rice and grilled vegetables.
Crazy reasonable prices, do not pass this up!"
Helios Restaurant,Greek,"241 St Mary's Road Winnipeg, MB R2H 1J4 Canada",MB,49.8748761,-97.1169439,5,Brings back our Greece trip memories. Good food. Staff is very friendly. The owner oversees the operation like an OG greek.
Helios Restaurant,Greek,"241 St Mary's Road Winnipeg, MB R2H 1J4 Canada",MB,49.8748761,-97.1169439,4,Got chicken souvlaki. Came with greek salad and toast and they were both great! Chicken was tender and nicely grilled. The meal came with roasted veggies and lemony potatoes (which my husband didn’t like too much but I loved it!) Their tzatziki sauce is not too garlicky (which may be good or bad for you depending on your preference.) The inside is clean and warm especially since it was -1 outside.
The Park Cafe,Breakfast & Brunch,"330 Assiniboine Park Drive Winnipeg, MB R3P 2N6 Canada",MB,49.8731968,-97.233504,4,The atmosphere was superb but food was so-so! Had smoked salmon benedicts but the salmon was too salty. The pancakes were good nonetheless and price was reasonable.

Good food. The kids loved the fries but thought the grilled cheese was over cheesy. I really enjoyed the smoked salmon salad. The lighting is great with huge windows overlooking the duck pond.

I opted for a tasty House Park Burger. I added cheese and bacon to compliment a well cooked burger. It was topped with lettuce, tomato and grilled onions, as well as, a spiced aioli. Mmm!

The hand cut fries were golden and crispy and well portioned.

While I didn’t eat the banana bread pudding, it looked wonderful and got a hearty thumbs up."

I dined in once pre-pandemic during a really busy lunch rush and remember the waitress still going above and beyond for my table. The customer service really is fantastic!

A great little cafe that I definitely recommend checking out."
QDOBA Mexican Eats,Mexican,"1340 Ellice Ave Unit 1 Winnipeg, MB R3G 0E9 Canada",MB,49.8937103,-97.1950081,1,Second time we ordered and food substandard. Tonight it was delivered to another place as we did not get it. So we dealt with that and reordered. The corn chips that were in our meals and side bag were so salty i would consider it toxic- and i like salt! You can visibly see more salt than chips on them. It ruined the meal entirely as they were in it too. May be hard to see in photo but white crust of salt is there. Probably will never order from them again.  Too expensive for mush and salt!

I Keep having the same issue since this employee has been hired.
For 2-3 years. Anytime she is there I don’t even get food. I just leave. Way Too stressful. Except on 5/28/23 as I was way to hungry. Didn’t wanna turn around and leave this time.
I have emailed Corporate and none of them including the owner have done nothing to address it.

District manager didn’t address any of the  issues. Blamed me and said I had a personal vendetta.
I didn’t even know her name till today..
Very biased and prejudice employees here.
I can see why this place is very low quality. Even Ryan Morton who’s suppose to be district manager has a “vendetta” against me.
He blamed me for their mistakes. Said they offered a free burrito. How’s that gonna fox the ongoing issue?
She Can give away free food and cups and food containers but can’t give me a 5 cent bag.
Place is a joke.
No wonder the employees are always so sad.
Nobody wants to work under incompetence."
QDOBA Mexican Eats,Mexican,"1340 Ellice Ave Unit 1 Winnipeg, MB R3G 0E9 Canada",MB,49.8937103,-97.1950081,1,"Way too pricey for what it is - stale chips, fatty chunks in the meat, veggies not prepped well (big pieces of bell pepper was off-putting with every bite). I will say, the queso dip is pretty good, however,  will not be returning. Could not finish burrito (rare for me!!!)"

The patio is excellent, they had Caesar’s on special on Saturday and the buffalo chicken we tried was great !

The only slight miss are the chairs on patio have marks on them and look kinda old, but it’s a kinda minor as everything else is pretty great !"
The Canadian Brewhouse,Sports Bars,"1715 Kenaston Boulevard Winnipeg, MB R3Y 1V5 Canada",MB,49.8204152,-97.1972559,5,A real ‘come as you are’ sports bar with great beverages and possibly the city’s best nachos. It’s a pretty big place so we got in right away. Stanley cup finals had the joint jumping. My wife said it was the best Cesar she ever had. Massive beer selection but I didn’t see any local options. Overall really great!
The Canadian Brewhouse,Sports Bars,"1715 Kenaston Boulevard Winnipeg, MB R3Y 1V5 Canada",MB,49.8204152,-97.1972559,2,"I had booked a reservation for my birthday at this location and upon arrival, we weren’t provided any menus. I grabbed some off the bar and didn’t think this was a huge deal. As we started to order - the server began coming back and fourth to our table saying they were out of certain things (a total of 3 times - no stir fry, no Alfredo sauce for the kid pasta, no noodles for the kid pasta). The server wanted to check on the noodles because “they might have frozen ones”….. no thanks. We had ordered the kids each a pop (total of 2 kid pops) and 4 adult pops. When we were unable to order meals that the children wanted, I wanted, or my dad wanted, I kindly asked for the bill for the pops and advised the server this wasn’t going to work. She brought a bill for 4 pops (2 were completely untouched and not consumed in any way) and 2 kid pops (that are complimentary with kid meals, AND untouched). The restaurant offers a great selection of food and kid menu items but no stock for items sucked. The servers attitude changed drastically as she had to continue telling us they were out of items as if we had annoyed her…. My apologies girlie. If I return in the future, I would return with no children as this isn’t the best place to take them, but great atmosphere for adults if they could adequately staff the kitchen!"

The guys we were with did the Burger challenge. Eat the whole burger (6 Patties and poutine) in an hour and it’s free.
The quesadilla was not great….  It had some weird tangy sauce in it. Didn’t stay together. Was a mess. The poutines are horrible. Crinkle fries out of a bag? The gravy tastes like hospital or powdered gravy. Hardly any cheese. Hard pass.  The nachoes were decent. Jalapeños poppers decent.
The food is basically edible here, better if your two drinks in."

My server was Jade and she was very polite, super nice, made great conversation and food came in reasonable time. I had the spinach dip but with mini bread instead of the chips and it was delicious, recommended by jade. Drinks were also amazing and made quickly too. Highly recommend for a nice summer night, especially on patio."

The yuca frita con chicharron was incredible, and all recognizable ingredients. I had it boiled, just to be safe. It was also AIP compliant! My spouse had the pupusas. Very happy. Restaurant was nice and quiet, no loud music. Owner very friendly."

This food is underpriced. The service is great!

These meals were huge, 11.95$ wait time was about 18 minutes. Just Amazing!!"

Don't expect a normal soft drink as they only have their own brews. The closest thing to a normal soft drink is their root beer. They do have a couple of fresh fruit smoothies and various teas.

So far, this man is the only man that when I asked for recommendations, told me straight up, no hesitation, the listed sandwiches were his recommendations.

I chose the Ruben.

He was right.

That is all.

Great for if you’re looking for a fresh option. The platter makes a great dinner (choice of Greek or Cesar salad, rice, lemon potato, skewer, pita and two tzatziki sauce). Highly recommend the spanakopita too! If you have any space left, get yourself a piece of baklava (sometimes available in chocolate!)"

This is place is not value for money; paid $15 for 1 chicken skewer for 4 small pieces and 1 BIG SIZE Potato. I rather recommend visiting local Greek restaurant. Rice is bland with no seasoning and flavor.

The staff was careless and rude. Not a word of thank you/ have a good day/ enjoy.. etc. customer service here is awful. They know the food is so dry so they charge an extra 50c for some Walmart tzatziki sauce.

I asked for the opa platter with no potatos. So when she was making my salad, I asked for extra salad because I kid you not, i recieved 7 pieces of lettuce. I asked for more lettuce and she said this is what you get. Then proceeds to remind me that I didn’t get potato so I can get more salad. SHe gives me TWO more pieces of lettuce. She then burns my pita on the grill and half of it is black! I get home only to see the chicken on the skewer is what I would feed my 4lb dog. Extremely shocked with this whole ex pierce I decided to write this. Don’t recommend going here ."
OPA! of Greece SmartCentres Kenaston,Greek,"1639 Kenaston Boulevard Building F Winnipeg, MB R3P Canada",MB,49.8246619,-97.2027861,2,"I had a ceasar salad & skewer delivered and was quite disappointed. The salad was pre-dressed but also had a side of dressing ? Which made the lettuce and croutons extremely soggy by the time I received and ate it, and of course the side dressing went to waste as it was already dressed..

I had to force myself to eat it because I had no other food. I honestly think the salad was old/sitting for a very long time as I don’t understand why anyone would send a salad for delivery pre-dressed and how it could be so soggy. Any restaurant you go to will send dry salad with dressing on the side. It tasted old, and not a single crunchy crouton could be found. Just gross mush.

The chicken skewer was also burnt and tough. I won’t be trying this place again. ): If I had any other option besides starving myself, I would have thrown it in the garbage."

As it turned out the Black Knight seemed to be a very popular spot with the locals as the crowd increased in time. Compared with some other places in Old Town the prices were more reasonable for beer and food. As a bonus, we happened to be there at the same time that the band The Sheepdogs were practicing upstairs. They were in Yellowknife for a show later that evening upstairs and the sound was great downstairs in the bar. As for food the onion rings were good, unfortunately the chicken wings tasted like they had freezer burn. All in all a very pleasant experience."

Decent Chinese food, spring rolls very tasty filling if a tiny bit over fried, dumplings were great, duck very tasty some pieces were again slightly over done but the crispy skin was divine, the star of the meal was the pork chow mein with noodles, (piping hot, tasty and chock full of vegetables). Go for this dish if nothing else. Reasonable priced and good service."

Wrong move - the food was amazing but the portion size is just too big! I think the portion size works for two moderately hungry people. I ordered the curry chicken and rice platter which comes with a vegetable salad. The food is very flavoursome and irresistible. Warning, if you feel the food is hot don't try the sauce/chutney served with the platter thinking it'll make things cooler - it's HOT!😁 I also tried some stuff from the Mahiberawi Combination that my friend got and instantly regretted that I didn't get it. I'd totally try that with rice!"

Ordered a mushroom and prosciutto stuffed chicken thigh in an orange sauce. The sauce was overly sweet and wasn't counterbalanced with a savoury enough filling. I couldn't find any trace of prosciutto in the stuffing, and if it was there I couldn't taste it. I mentioned my thoughts to the waiter, who said he's inform the chef, but I never heard back. Others in our party also didn't feel they received value for their money."

A healthy choice that hits the curry craving perfectly. Loved it."

Waited over 5 minutes for a host to seat us when it was not busy. After being seated for 5 min waiter asked what we would like to eat. Didn't start with drinks or apps. Over priced, all mains 45$. I had the boar tenderloin and rabbit casserole. tenderloin its self was good, however they give you pretty much hickory sticks and this corn cheese puree as sides which were very under seasoned no flavour. The rabbit casserole had good flavour after spending 5 minutes picking out all the bones. The entire time no one asked how everything was, if we wanted more drinks, even when paying didn't ask how meal was. 2 people, 107$ very unhappy."

We ordered from the app and arrived at the time specified. The food was on the counter and it took a good few minutes for someone to acknowledge we were, so we had to flag someone down from the kitchen to get our order. We sat down and it seemed all the tables were dirty or had something on them. The food was not very good, considering what you pay for it and most of the normally amazing chicken strips were uneatable and the poutine was flavourless.

Its ideal location within walking distance of several tourist hotels adds to its convenience. With prices comparable to Starbucks, it offers a sweet respite in the chilly Yellowknife weather. The hot beverages are truly refreshing, and we particularly enjoyed their delectable sandwiches. However, we weren't as fond of their soup. Despite this minor setback, this spot remains a captivating haven for a cozy break in Yellowknife."

The latte is surprisingly good and i like the fact that this place opens late. No complaints, yet nothing really stands out. This is a bit of a shame, as i would not have given it a second look in passing. This is a bit of a hidden gem. To nit pick, the coke fridge looks out of place."

It’s located right in the centre of the old town and is at walkable distance from the tourist hotels. We had been there twice during our stay in YK and had some refreshing, hot brews."
Pizza Hut,Pizza,"312 D Old Airport Road Yellowknife, NT X1A 3T3 Canada",NT,62.4482083,-114.4067276,1,Not even close to the standard expected from Pizza Hut elsewhere. Pan pizza crust was soggy and none of the specials offered elsewhere were honoured. Trying to order online in disabled as the website does not recognize addresses and tells you to call in.
Pizza Hut,Pizza,"312 D Old Airport Road Yellowknife, NT X1A 3T3 Canada",NT,62.4482083,-114.4067276,1,Too expensive and most of the time poor service edit. we called pizza hut to place an order for delivery. This was our order one large half pepperoni half Hawaiian pizza and one large bread sticks with cheese the total without tax was $72.00 and when we tried to order the exact samething on the pizza hut app it was only 57.00 something why such a price difference
Pizza Hut,Pizza,"312 D Old Airport Road Yellowknife, NT X1A 3T3 Canada",NT,62.4482083,-114.4067276,2,"We ordered from here twice, only bcuz we gave it a 2nd chance, and it was bad both times. We normally prefer Pizza Hut but this location leaves the pan crust Pizza extremely doughy, the inside of the crust both times was almost raw dough, and its not like they're the cheapest either.  Unfortunate since it would only take a few more minutes in the oven to make it a great Pizza."

Subway,Sandwiches,"100 Borden Drive Unit 21 Yellowknife, NT X1A 3W6 Canada",NT,62.4499496,-114.4065145,1,"Worst sandwich ever. Given a 6' veggie with finger picked lettuce from the old tray (redish strains, discolored lettuce) and a full load of jalapeños. The customer just before me gets a big bowl of fresh lettuce from a fresh tray. I don't know why the difference ? Was my sandwich cheaper, lol Or they decide on whos who ? I would have asked for more however, gave up and decided wont come back. Wonder if anyone does any surprise checks on their quality."

It's quick, and the service is great. The food is always good, IMO. If you like subs, definitely check it out as an alternative to other fast food restaurants. Eat in or take out, subway is great."
Subway,Sandwiches,"100 Borden Drive Unit 21 Yellowknife, NT X1A 3W6 Canada",NT,62.4499496,-114.4065145,1,The service here has been on the decline for some time. Three staff behind the counter loading the cooler with drinks. Stood there without acknowledgement. In my opinion someone should at least let you know that they will be a minute. Waited a few minutes.  Not until I said Really? Did someone say anything. Then the response was almost passive aggressive. “We will be there in a minute”. Left promptly. Will NOT be returning.

Let her know it’s supposed to be 2 full scoops and she gave attitude and added the rest of the 1/4 of the first scoop even though another staff told her it’s 2 (she ignored it).
Continued to do a sloppy job of veggies, sauce and wrapping and pretended she didn’t know better when I called her out on it.
Nowhere to put a complaint forward to management so you get an online review instead. Do better."

We were seated inside which was so convenient as you can enjoy the atmosphere and stay warm in the cool nights. The server was so helpful with his suggestions. The food is so tasty! Full of flavor, properly served and you will be waiting for the next bite to indulge on the combination of flavors. The dessert is simply prefect, not too sweet yet memorable! We went late night so there were out of paella on a busy Sunday night yet it looked so good and I would definitely recommend giving it a try!"

It's a romantic date spot, especially in the summer!

Marché Mon Pitou,Cafes,"1387 W 7th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6H 1B8 Canada",BC,49.2654363,-123.135785,5,I ordered a Flat White and it was the best coffee I’ve had so far. The food is tasty and the raspberry tart is nice. Staff are so friendly. The cafe is small but it still could cater for around 14 people. It’s a very nice place to have a lunch and coffee in a cozy afternoon.
Marché Mon Pitou,Cafes,"1387 W 7th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6H 1B8 Canada",BC,49.2654363,-123.135785,1,"We are extremely disappointed with our experience today with the manager of this coffee shop. We bought their coffee and canelé (the pastry in the picture) and got something from the coffee shop next door then picked a outside seat at Mon Pitou. The manager rudely kicked us out because we had something which is not from them placed on the table. They must have the sign if they don't allow outside food/drink. But we respected it and moved to  a table of the shop next door. He clearly looked down on us. He suddenly touched (tapped) my boyfriend's shoulder without asking and interrupted him. By the way, the canelé tastes bad. It seemed old, dry and over-burned. I will never come back here again.
Today we were able to experience food/ drink and service of Mon Pitou and Wicked Cafe. If you were to choose between two, we would recommend Wicked Cafe."
Marché Mon Pitou,Cafes,"1387 W 7th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6H 1B8 Canada",BC,49.2654363,-123.135785,4,"The brunch here is exceptional. Without a doubt, the hollandaise sauce is the finest I've ever tasted. The ambiance is simply delightful, reminiscent of the beautiful southern region of France. Furthermore, the staff are incredibly kind and hospitable. If you're in Vancouver, you simply must come here. This is a charming location to enjoy Sunday brunch. The quality of the ingredients is excellent, and the washroom is beautifully designed. Despite the focus on French cuisine, there are also vegan choices available."
Marché Mon Pitou,Cafes,"1387 W 7th Avenue Vancouver, BC V6H 1B8 Canada",BC,49.2654363,-123.135785,5,"Mon Pitou is perfection. The ambience is so carefully thought out and fun, the coffee is spectacular and full of flavor, and the food is outstanding! You really can’t ask for more, Vancouver is lucky to have a French cafe of this quality.

I got the ham and cheese danish and a cortado and couldn’t have been more pleased. Can’t wait to come back to try more things. The music and atmosphere is so relaxing 🙏🏽 🇫🇷"

My husband and I often stop by for their breakfast sandwiches, but their actual brunch is really good. Pricey, but all brunch places are getting to be pricier these days, so it isn't really surprising or unexpected.  My only complaint is that it feels a bit cramped when it gets busy, but it can't be helped given the constraints of the location."

The interior is very modern and nice. So if you are interested to taste a Ukrainian food prepared with some modern flavour then this is one of the best places to go in Vancouver.  You can also purchase some very nice bread and home made cookies there as well!"

The restaurant is busy but not too full (reservations available), the staff are quite friendly, the food is very pleasant and the atmosphere is comfortable.

We had the chicken kyiv and cabbage rolls (the rolls were juicy and stoodout most).

The real showstopper was the bakery! So fresh and delicious. We really enjoyed the double chocolate chip cookie, the pistachio chocolate chip cookie and the BABKA dark chocolate slice. Absolutely delightful. We will get the full babka loaf for a family special occasion!"
Kozak Ukraïnian Eatery,Ukrainian,"1 W Cordova Street Vancouver, BC V6C 3N8 Canada",BC,49.2827218,-123.1046125,5,Delicious food and very attentive employees.

I got the Island Bowl and was seriously impressed… the fish just tastes so fresh and has an irresistible marinade coating. All the ingredients were bursting with flavor and worked together so well… was a bit steep at $15-20 per bowl but ended up being so good that I’d go again.

Definitely recommend trying this place!"
Island Poké,Poke,"1674 Douglas Street Victoria, BC V8W 2G6 Canada",BC,48.4290536,-123.3648556,5,Delicious poke with crunchy and umami toppings. Requested the tangerines on the side and the service kindly put the portion into small containers.

All kinds of choices for your bowl. You can pretty much have it made the way you want it. The service was great we got to watch our food be made right in front of us. Stayed at the restaurant to eat, and this little place was cozy.
I'm not much for raw sushi type foods. I'll tell you one thing,, I was impressed and probably will go back."
JBI Café Restaurant,Cafes,"270 Government Street Victoria, BC V8V 2L2 Canada",BC,48.4153947,-123.3694605,5,"This is the second time I've stayed here. I love it, the rooms are small and still use the old style hot water heating radiator so if it's cold in there it will take a bit to heat up. There is no AC so I'd expect it can get hot in the summer. The hotel has a colourful history and is over 100 years old. The hallways are adorned with Emily Carr Paintings (she died there) also the hotel supposedly is one of the most haunted in Canada although I haven't experienced anything while there.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. If you're into older style hotels that aren't just another boring place then this place is for you."
JBI Café Restaurant,Cafes,"270 Government Street Victoria, BC V8V 2L2 Canada",BC,48.4153947,-123.3694605,5,"This is one of my favorite spots for dinner when in town.  I’ve tried almost everything on the menu and have yet to find something I didn’t enjoy.

In addition to the regular menu, they have specials each evening, which typically include a pasta and a main entree.  These can sell out quickly on busy nights.

The Caesar salad is amazing and I always get one!

There are several vegetarian options and the veggie burger is great.

Bar options are limited in the restaurant but you can enjoy beer or wine with your meal.

Service is always friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is cozy."

Roy at the desk was a gem. Dinner in the bar was great with friendly conversation, and they accommodated us when we said we needed our breakfast to be quick.

I only don’t give them a 5 star review because the menu doesn’t specify what the gluten free options or any other dietary options are. The service was good and they are pet friendly at the patio. I had a gluten free Brie pear prosciutto chicken burger. It was good but later on I realized that I could have opted for lettuce wrap and my server didn’t even mentioned anything. Anyway we enjoy our food and will definitely come back. 😊

I am vegan and was treated with the most respect. Our server went above and beyond for me to create meals I could eat and without even asking checked on what desserts were vegan.

My parents ordered off the menu, while I explored the buffet. Sadly the buffet featured many items that were overcooked, dried, or inedible.  The shrimp was awesome. The butter chicken dry.  The onion pakora was so dried-out it was impossible to chew. Same with the Potato Pakora. Staff were kind and attentive.  Both of my parents menu ordered items were excellent.  I do NOT recommend the buffet."

The Dock on Princess,Bars,"1133 Princess Avenue Brandon, MB R7A 0R1 Canada",MB,49.8471406,-99.9538915,1,"I cannot really rate on atmosphere as I did not eat in the restaurant. I was at section 6 which has their menu on each table and you have to order through the brewery. The food was horrible. We waited over an hour for our food. I know we were not priority as we were not in the restaurant but if you are taking my money as a take out order I think you should treat me as a paying customer. We finally had the brewery call the dock to see if our food was coming. Within minute our food was there. Cold and terrible.
I will never be back. Love the dock as a customer when I'm in the restaurant so disappointing when they know I've paid for my food and can't complain to the brewery. If I had more time I would have walked over and said something to the management. If you want your menu displayed on a table treat the customer with a bit of respect . We all work hard for our money. I would have had no problem walking over and picking up my food 30 minutes earlier when it was ready. Places get busy and staff is hard to come by but if you don't have the staff to manage don't put it a service you really can't provide. Look up all my reviews I don't just put the bad places up I love writing a good review 😌. I have been a business owner for over 27 years..."

Came with a couple co-workers and it was very busy and obviously short-staffed, as most places nowadays. We were also on a very limited time crunch. The wait was getting long, over 30 min, but when we expressed how we were needing to leave to get back to work, the staff moved our order up., without us even asking! We may have speed-ate our lunch, but it was absolutely delicious!! The prices were a bit high, but that's seen at every place nowadays.

The Keg Steakhouse + Bar - Brandon,Steakhouses,"1836 Brandon Ave Brandon, MB R7B 3G8 Canada",MB,49.8326322,-99.9629125,5,"It's really unfortunate that food prices have gotten so horrible that it's being seen in restaurants all over because, I absolutely love The Keg! Aside from what they can't control, this place is still the most amazing places for a romantic dinner. The dishes are still to die for and always the perfect steak! The service is always over-the-top exceptional and without being annoyed by constant interruptions. Beautiful location!
So aside from the prices going up, which they can't control, this is the greatest place to enjoy a nice meal with your partner or staff get-together."
The Keg Steakhouse + Bar - Brandon,Steakhouses,"1836 Brandon Ave Brandon, MB R7B 3G8 Canada",MB,49.8326322,-99.9629125,5,"A truly ‘safe bet’ for a great meal. The restaurant was busy but not packed (that’s a good thing). Very clean. Excellent staff and service. Our waitress (Jocelyn) was attentive and had a great sense of humor.
We were there during their Summer Lobster special menu. The lobster bisque was possibly the best I’ve ever tasted. Everyone had a steak combo and all were very good (as you’d expect).
Dessert was a shared ‘Billy Miner pie’ and strongly suggest saving room for this (best to share…it’s quite generous).
Lots of parking and clean washrooms."
The Keg Steakhouse + Bar - Brandon,Steakhouses,"1836 Brandon Ave Brandon, MB R7B 3G8 Canada",MB,49.8326322,-99.9629125,4,"Maybe The Keg isn't somewhere you'd think to go for good wings, but you'd be mistaken! The Three Pepper Wings are only on their bar menu and not always available. I had the chance to try them a week or so ago and was not disappointed. The chicken was crispy and without all of the fat that some wings can have. They were served with what I'm assuming was a three pepper sauce, which was a mild heat but gave a good kick at times, along with a light blue cheese dressing. There were plenty of blue cheese crumbles on top. I thought the sliced celery was a nice touch because it was incorporated into the dish rather than an afterthought on the side. It's a great dish for those who want to take ""wings with a side of blue cheese"" to the next level! -1 because I think $17 for 8 wings is expensive, but still something that I'd want to order every so often.

UPDATE: I highly recommend the Prime Rib Sandwich as an alternative to the traditional dinner menu items -- it's less spendy and just as tasty! The tender meat, strong horseradish (it's the best at The Keg), and generous portion of red wine herb jus were all very flavourful. I substituted a Caesar salad instead of fries at no additional cost. It's only $16 during cocktail hour on the bar side. I'll be going back for it again very soon!"

I didn’t like seeing two of the gals having to struggle cutting their sirloin steaks so I assumed the meat was tough. I never order steak anymore as the last two times I ordered the filet. there was gristle in it. Yum! I like it when the BM pie has some structure to it as ours were sitting out too long before it was served to us.

Fast service (wasn't very accommodating/not interested in educating me in the options, seemed very bored).  Building ""my own burrito"" was very quick overall.

However, the prices were way too high. Over 20 bucks for a wrap with mostly rice and corn? Maybe don't have 6 staff on with no customers present, and the prices could be changed. At this price, the food becomes a treat more than a regular go-to for a meal."

I'd pay that any day of the week... EXCEPT this day. Tiny tacos, they were out of Mini bowls so they used a regular bowl and put the tiniest amount in it. My wife had snacks at work thankfully to hold her thru the day, I hit Burger King on the way to work to fill up.
Pretty disappointed, I don't think I'll ever eat lunch here again, too expensive for what you receive."

First was the pasta : it is billed as fresh pasta made daily , perhaps it was, but it was swimming in a diluted, weak, Kraft dinner tasting sauce. All there was for veggies was red and green pepper. I know there was other veggies in the kitchen as my wife's steak came with a side of carrots. Second dinner was burger and fries : obviously fries went down at same time as burger,  because fries were plated first and were cold upon arrival. Burger was good tasting, but red peppers ( which are wet, right ? ) don't belong on the bottom bun, because...wait for it, they get soggy. Put them on top of the chicken , this is cooking 101. If you are staying in the hotel, and are being lazy its OK, but don't make an effort to go here...."

Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals. We have another night here, and will be going to the Echo for breakfast tomorrow. Thank you to all the staff for making our stay great. One note though, you may want to consider installing large overhead fans to assist the AC, which wasn't able to keep the restaurant comfortably cool. Other than that A++."

The minute you walk in you feel transported to an amazing destination.
The music and decorations in the venue provide the perfect atmosphere for the amazing food that is about to arrive.

The prices were very reasonable. The owners were very friendly and helpful with explaining the menu as I am new to Ethiopian food.

I ordered the beef cha cha and it was phenomenal.. it arrives on a cast iron skillet and is sizzling with the most satisfying of sounds.

The coffee is a must try as well if you stop in here"

In this restaurant you will find the best soulful cuisine and a lovely owner. The flavours and spices were also perfect for me. I was just passing by on my way to Vancouver, and I’m so happy I stumbled on this place. If I can find an Ethiopian restaurant half as good in BC I’ll be blessed!

Thank you for this wonderful and yet so simple experience."

It was very flavourful and huge portions even with takeout being the only option at the time.

I was finally in the area again recently and decided to give the pretzel ""charcuterie"" board a try. Everything was delicious but sadly didn't really taste any of the garlic butter that was supposed to be on the pretzel... which was pretty disappointing. Although the candied bacon was great, kettle chips had the perfect crunch, sauce variety was fantastic. Overall it was satisfying but the pretzel itself needs more work. Between two people it was a very filling lunch and could definitely be shared with three!

Customer service was fantastic during both visits. Will definitely be back again."

It's more of a meal on its own. I shared with my daughter because the portion was so big. As far as flavor goes, the BBQ sauce wasn't overpowering. The sauce was sweet and tangy but there was hardly no curds and that's what makes a true poutine. Other than that it was still good."

Don't be discouraged by the prices, the amount of toppings more than make this worth it.

If you are looking for one of the best pizzas out there definitely order from here"

The food here is absolutely the best omg I've been to a lot of pizza joints and they don't compare to this one. Price is decent and I gotta say the chicken fettuccine Alfredo is hands down the most tastiest I've ever had. Used to be my go to place for pregnancy cravings. My little guy loved it. If your looking for a great pizza and pasta place this is it. I always wished for other locations to be opened but unfortunately the only way to experience the Romanas cuisine is to head to Brandon. I'll have to take some pictures next time as we were on a little road trip and ate in the vehicle. Staff is really friendly very well mannered and polite. Thank you my compliments to the chef very delicious 😋💯❤️💯

Need to add that Marco might consider wiping their hand prior to closing the box - see photo…"

But once again, this is the 3rd time we’ve had a terrible meal. Not impressed, considering the price we pay. Even the Caesar salad had a weird taste, the lettuce taste almost like fish."

My partner is gluten free and loves the hot chicken caesar salad without croutons while I enjoy the pierogi pizza! If you are planning on delivery I would suggest calling direct rather than using snappy eats. Unfortunately although requested the salad contained croutons and my partner could not eat it and my pizza contained no chives or green onions.

The sandwich was perfect and he did not skimp on the sauce or my toppings. It was the first time in a long time I actually felt full eating a sub.

Far better experience than at the Corral Center location."

We haven't had BP for a long time and I've always liked their Crispy chicken pecan salad in the past. This time, so disappointing, the salad was definitely not worth the $20 for only two tiny chicken fingers and 11 pecans. I realize food has gone up in price but this was ridiculous. Won't be ordering from BP again anytime soon. Not worth the money."
Boston Pizza,Pizza,"2-1140 Richmond Avenue Brandon, MB R7A 1M6 Canada",MB,49.8263635,-99.9537393,3,"Friendly staff, restaurant was very clean, food was okay. I had the spaghetti with meatballs and cheese, but weirdly enough they didn't have a big enough bowl to serve it in. So they served me a 2 meatball plate and a kids sized 1 meatball one. Very strange to have two bowls in front of you. Just order bigger bowls!

It was a large serving but not too tasty. Meatballs were not fresh, spaghetti sauce tasted like a canned sauce, pasta slightly overcooked. Wouldn't order that again.

The kid's food was okay, he had chicken strips with fries.
Appetizers we're alright for the price.

The restaurant had TV's everywhere and the kids menus came with a coloring book and crayons.

Overall verdict: fun for kids but don't go out of your way for the food."

Once she arrived, she seemed very unorganized. She didn't know my name, knew nothing about my past work experience, and was hesitant about taking my references. After our interview, she ensured me I would be getting a call by the end of the week or the start of the next. 2 weeks go by and i hear nothing. I called the location for any updates on my application. The worker who picked up told me the manager at store was in a meeting, she told me to leave a message and that I'd get a call back soon. Another hour goes by, still nothing, so i call again.
A different worker picks up the phone but she tells me that there hasn't been a manager at the restaurant all day. I leave a message again and i still haven't gotten a call back. I am extremely disappointed by the unprofessionalism shown by the staff and management."

Expensive but good. Anyway today the pizza I had was ALL sauce. No toppings really just sauce. And then 4.50 for a bottled water is a hard price gauge.

We ordered over the phone and had issues right away on trying to understand what we wanted. So after that order was placed and we walk into the store.  MY F.G... so dirty gross floors and walls and nobody wear gloves that were preparing the food. Some touching their face all huddled over food being made.. gross.  We bought 4 meals and only got 1 drink and chips.. should have been 4 drinks 4 bag of chips. Gross if I could give zero stars I would.. disappointing when did they change owners???

Only had 1 plate/person at buffet table. When asked why I was told Buffet had ended yet we hadn’t been told this when waiting to be seated. Some items did not get refilled at all on the buffet.
Not to mention, the buffet was extremely expensive considering the poor service we received.

I guess their staffs need more training and more focus on good service, this is 3rd time we have this kind of worst experience.. now Pizza hut is my “NO GO TO PLACE”."

Apparent sponsor of the hockey tournament. Son won player of the game. Went to redeem the coupon and wouldn’t honour what was printed on the coupon because they “accidentally misprinted” what the voucher was actually for. After the clueless counter attendant in the burka was rude as hell while explaining this to me she retrieved the equally as rude manager Paketdeep who came over and again explained that they misprinted the voucher. If you’re going to be a sponsor for a hockey tournament then honour your commitment. Easy to be a sponsor, harder to follow up on your commitment of sponsoring an event. Pretty embarrassing for the AAA challenge tournament in Brandon and for the wheat kings as a whole. I would probably distance myself from this restaurant in the future."

Menu is very gluten free friendly, my waitress was able to guide me through the menu for gluten free options and most items (except the pastas) either were gluten free already or easily adjusted to be. We got the tomatoes (with gluten free bread), cabbage, scallops, and chicken. The atmosphere inside was beautiful with lots of hanging plants. Loved our cocktails, too, especially the honey badger.

The swing section was closed when we were there - but the atmosphere of the restaurant is super airy and pretty! I really liked it. Drinks were fun. Food was also great. We had the tuna to start which was interesting. The beef short rib was top notch and a generous portion. I would say it’s on the pricier end, but I didn’t feel like it was unreasonable for what you got. Service was also good. Would come back for sure!"

Our food and drinks came quickly and servers were friendly. The space is large with different sections from open concept, bar seating, to more private tables in the corners. The fried cheese bits on the kale caesar salad was a great touch. All the food was tasting good, however the wings were on the salty side so the sauce was needed to mild them out."

The back patio is ideal and very cosy for date nights. You must try the wings, cornbread, fried pork belly and the beef short rib! The smoke from the food is a match made in heaven with a good scotch. The service is also on point and you won’t be disappointed."
Hayden Block Smoke & Whiskey,Barbeque,"1136 Kensington Road NW Calgary, AB T2N 3P3 Canada",AB,51.0527217,-114.0882254,5,Service was quick. I honestly believe it’s the best Mac and cheese out there. Watermelon salad was good for a hot day. Pecan pie was crispy. Would recommend! The bathroom are down two flights of stairs so not super accessible if you’re needing accessibility. Parallel parking around here is free after 6pm!
Hayden Block Smoke & Whiskey,Barbeque,"1136 Kensington Road NW Calgary, AB T2N 3P3 Canada",AB,51.0527217,-114.0882254,5,Had a great lunch at Hayden Block to wrap our Calgary visit.  We came without any expectation but found a real gem. The sliced brisket sandwich was definitely our favorite but we also liked the salads and brisket plate. Good draft beer selection and an impressive whiskey/bourbon list (as you would expect from a restaurant with that name) makes it a real fun place.
Hayden Block Smoke & Whiskey,Barbeque,"1136 Kensington Road NW Calgary, AB T2N 3P3 Canada",AB,51.0527217,-114.0882254,5,Beef short rib is amazing，tasty.

We tried the brisket, chicken, and bacon-wrapped corn on the cob. All of the food was pretty good and the sauces made it even better.

The server was also friendly and Hayden Block has a great patio for the summer."
Calan Beef Noodle,Chinese,"2219 Centre Street N Calgary, AB T2E 2T4 Canada",AB,51.0719639,-114.0630136,4,"I have dined in and ordered delivery from Calan Beef Noodle over the years. They have always been a place with consistent, good quality noodles.

On this occasion, we ordered the:
1) Hand pulled noodle in braised beef soup - The soup has a nice beef flavor and the cuts of beef are tender and flavorful. Noodles are al dente which I liked. My only complaint is that the dish could use a bit more vegetables to accompany it.
2) Stir fried noodle with cumin lamb and vegetables - In my mind, this should be their featured dish. The lamb is tender and seasoned well. The cumin flavor is not over powering and the noodles are firm but not tough. Very enjoyable to eat.
3) Sesame balls - I would not recommend ordering these. They are probably around 80% dough. It is a bit dry and the filling is fairly minimal and I was only able to guess that the filling is red bean (from the visual rather than taste).

Overall, their noodle dishes are excellent and at a pretty reasonable price. Will be back for these!"
Calan Beef Noodle,Chinese,"2219 Centre Street N Calgary, AB T2E 2T4 Canada",AB,51.0719639,-114.0630136,5,"They have great beef cuts for the noodles and the thick noodles are great. The texture of the hand-prepared noodles had a pleasant chew and added to the experience while downing the hot, mildly-flavored soup. The beef completes the trifecta, with a soft and flavorful addition with the broth.

I recommend # 7 (braised beef) for a sweet, savory, and umami-flavored bowl. I don't recommend going for a combo as the add-ons weren't worth 6 dollars, in my opinion.

This bowl is perfect for a cold winter day as you unwind and share stories with friends in the weekend."
Calan Beef Noodle,Chinese,"2219 Centre Street N Calgary, AB T2E 2T4 Canada",AB,51.0719639,-114.0630136,5,"Legendary. This was my second time going here, and once again I was amazed. This place is a Calgary classic, and it deserves all the hype. The food is fresh, the service is fast, and it’s relatively inexpensive considering the portions. The food is so so amazing, I highly recommend the hand pulled noodle in beef braised soup (#7). Don’t forget to add the chilli oil!! I dream about this soup, and I believe everyone should get a chance to go here!!"
Calan Beef Noodle,Chinese,"2219 Centre Street N Calgary, AB T2E 2T4 Canada",AB,51.0719639,-114.0630136,3,"The noodle itself was very good, hand made noodle definitely tastes better. Had cumin lamb stir fry noodle and the soy bean paste noodle, flavor was okay nothing special, the soy bean paste was a bit salty. Good portion, we had leftover to take home, I was very full.
I would go back to try the beef noodle soup, that’s the signature dish.
It’s half self-serve style, overall the service was good, the waitress who worked there was very nice and attentive."
Calan Beef Noodle,Chinese,"2219 Centre Street N Calgary, AB T2E 2T4 Canada",AB,51.0719639,-114.0630136,4,Very authentic lanzhou beef noodles. Signature hand pull noodle bar you can see through the window. Each bowl’s noodle is made fresh. When they serve soup is not very hot already and noodle is stick together at bottom plus the bowl they gave is very small so kinda have to eat very cautious😂😂 but good taste for real. Also very good tea flavor boiled egg and side dishes. Space is little small if in rush hour you might need to wait. Parking is very limited too.
Calan Beef Noodle,Chinese,"109 - 683 10 Street SW Calgary, AB T2P 5G3 Canada",AB,51.0474565,-114.0864334,5,"What a place! Be prepared for a small wait as everything will be freshly made and the noodles hand-pulled as soon as your order is placed.

We went as a group and each ordered something different. Between just noodles or noodle soup, highly recommend the soup, as the broth is drool-worthy. Recommend getting the chili oil on the side so you can mix between regular and spicy vibes.

If you’re ordering a combo with the beef shanks, I highly recommend getting a braised beef, lamb and cumin, or chicken order for diversity.

Highly recommend ordering the tea as well. The decor on the tables features the variety of herbs and flavours you’ll find in your tea, and it’s both beautiful with the blooming flowers, and delicious with the infusion of flavours.

If you’re ever near either of the locations, pop in! It’ll warm your heart and belly and keep you full for hours."
Calan Beef Noodle,Chinese,"109 - 683 10 Street SW Calgary, AB T2P 5G3 Canada",AB,51.0474565,-114.0864334,5,"One of the best Chinese hand-pulled noodles in the city! We always go to their Centre St. location, good thing they have it here now in Downtown! Street parking can be a headache so plan ahead. We regularly order No.2 Noodles in pickled sour soup, and No.7 Noodle soup with braised beef. Both taste great and noodles were exceptional (thin cut). You can make it as a combo with eggs and sliced beef shanks. The crew guys were fast and amazing too!"
Calan Beef Noodle,Chinese,"109 - 683 10 Street SW Calgary, AB T2P 5G3 Canada",AB,51.0474565,-114.0864334,5,"This place was highly recommended by our son, and so last Friday me and my family finally was able to eat here. All of us then ordered #7 (Braised Beef with Noodle), and we also tried their house tea.
The Braised Beef with noodle did not disappoint - it was one of the best Chinese beef braised beef soup I had in years ! And by the way, all their noodles are all freshly made and hand pulled.
We also ordered their house tea - it also exceeded my expectations because it was not just an ordinary Chinese tea but it came with a whole shebang of herbs and spices (especially perfect during cold days).
We left the place satisfied and my stomach was full for several hours.
Would highly recommend this place."
Calan Beef Noodle,Chinese,"109 - 683 10 Street SW Calgary, AB T2P 5G3 Canada",AB,51.0474565,-114.0864334,5,"Tried 7 and 8
7 noodle soup with braised beef with flat and wide nooodle. The braised beef and soup was well seasoned. I have tried briased beef in toronto and the soup lacked flavor however here at Calan the braised beef soup was outstanding. When you do takeout the soup and noodles are in 2 container. Which is awesome since the noodles dont go soggy

8 cumin lamb with flat and narrow stir fried  noodle was awesome. The blend of spice elevated the dish.

Hands down the best chinese hand  pull noodle restaurant in calgary"
Calan Beef Noodle,Chinese,"109 - 683 10 Street SW Calgary, AB T2P 5G3 Canada",AB,51.0474565,-114.0864334,3,"On a cold winter day, we were craving for some hot noodle soup so we went to Calan for a nice bowl of hand pulled noodle in beef soup. This location wasn’t busy on weekend. The food & portion was ok but they don’t have any service. It was more like eating at a foodcourt with self service. The price was not cheap at all. I think one try is enough."

The atmosphere is calming and suitable for family and friends gatherings. They do take sometime to prepare the food but it's definitely worth it. We had to call 3 days in advance to book for Friday so I would definitely recommend booking beforehand. Overall, a good experience and I would definitely come back again."
The Himalayan,Himalayan/Nepalese,"3218 17 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T3E 0B3 Canada",AB,51.0380704,-114.1331665,5,This was our first meal in Calgary and it did not disappoint. We hadn’t booked but they still squeezed us in on a busy Sunday night. Delicious curry and stir fry with plenty of naan. Really friendly staff and some nice looking cocktails even though I didn’t try them.
The Himalayan,Himalayan/Nepalese,"3218 17 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T3E 0B3 Canada",AB,51.0380704,-114.1331665,5,"A seriously underrated spot in Calgary! The Himalayan serves Nepalese cuisine which is deeply flavoured with Indian and Chinese influences.

We love their momos - they’re little steamed pockets of dumplings just bursting with flavour. Pork is our favourite and I love the accompanying dipping sauce though the momos hold up very well on their own so no sauce is necessary.

Our favourite entree is the Poleko Grill with the New Zealand Lamb. The lamb is so tender and roasted flavour is delicious.

The garlic bread is really good and always worth upgrading to. Recently I tried their coconut bread - amazing! It’s got shredded coconut inside the bread but it’s not overly sweet. In fact the slight sweetness is a great vessel for their sauces and curries.

You can choose your spice level and if you’re not sure what to order, they will absolutely walk you through the menu.

The service is spectacular. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming. The staff greet you by name whether you’re coming or going. Literally reminds me of Cheers - sometimes you just want to go where everyone knows your name."
The Himalayan,Himalayan/Nepalese,"3218 17 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T3E 0B3 Canada",AB,51.0380704,-114.1331665,4,"Went for an early mother's day dinner.  There were 7 of us.  We ordered a bunch of food to share.  Portions were too small, especially 40 dollars for the grilled lamb and 35 for the grilled paneer.  Some folks had to split the lamb and cubes of paneer with each other so that the parents can have an actual cube, each.  Dishes aren't really meant for sharing family style.  For the price, not worth the order unless you're eating  the dish yourself.

Otherwise, flavors were really good, everyone was happy with the quality of food and service.  The eggplant and jomsom chicken was really good.

Price did not reflect the portion of food at such a highly rated place."
The Himalayan,Himalayan/Nepalese,"3218 17 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T3E 0B3 Canada",AB,51.0380704,-114.1331665,5,"My girl and I enjoy travelling and trying new restaurants and experiences, and returning to our favourites. After a long week for my girl, I thought a special and relaxing night was due- so off to the Himalayan! Several of our friends have mentioned it and we have been very eager to come check it out- we were absolutely stunned!

Our server Jon was fantastic- prompt, friendly and gave his favourite suggestions so we could enjoy a unwinding and relaxing dining experience. We enjoyed: pork momos, Lamb Chatpat, Lamb Himalayan curry, grilled lamb, and mango cream as well as our wine. Great wine list, and our dinners were perfectly prepared.

We would like to honour Jon as his table presence and service was impeccable-a good spirited and hard working guy. We have been to hundreds of restaurants and we would comfortably rate him as one of our favourite all time.

There’s a reason so many regulars lined up out the door- the Himalayan is simply amazing! The talent, menu definitely contends with the likes of VIj’s in Vancouver!!

Thank you chef and Jon for making our night awesome! We will be back as it was sensational!!!🍷❤️🏔"

Ramen is so far one of the best I've tried in the city. Don is ok. No disappointment so far.  If you are in the area, it's worth your time to try. It reminds me a bit of Kinton in Toronto. But the portion just cannot compare to it.

This was our first time and we loved it.  We got takeout but there's dine in inside and at patio. Line was long but goes by super quick. If you are getting takeout of only sushi or bubble tea, you can mention at entrance and go straight downstairs without waiting at lineup.
Great value, cool location and very well organized for covid. Temperature taken at arrival, sanitizer at entrance, menus to grab at entrance and drop off after ordering.
We had ramen, gyoza, yakitori, spring rolls, sushi and bubble tea. It was delicious!"

It was so delicious, perfect spicy level. The rice cake was perfect. The ambiance was fun, people were having a great time. The waitress and waiter was very fun welcoming and helpful. They also gave us free drinks which made us feel welcomed and they wanted us to enjoy ourselves. Great place to go and share meals."
Namsan Korean Cuisine,Korean,"507 10 Street SW Calgary, AB T2P 2B8 Canada",AB,51.0487208,-114.0862962,4,"A popular, fun, and very loud spot converted from an older multi level house serving large portioned Korean staples. Servers were friendly and checked on us as appropriate. It was quite busy so we ran out of time and had to vacate the table for the next reservation however the staff were very polite about this. The food was tasty however our gamjatang pork bones were not cooked enough making them tough to take apart and eat; they needed another hour or so to tender. Flavours were nice and spicy though and the pot could have used abut more filler; it looked a-bit flat compared to other places I’ve ordered this dish from."
Namsan Korean Cuisine,Korean,"507 10 Street SW Calgary, AB T2P 2B8 Canada",AB,51.0487208,-114.0862962,5,"One of my favorite Korean food
진짜 맛있는 맛집. 맛집 추천. The staff are always really helpful with explaining the menu. The staff are really friendly and hands down best service a Korean restaurant can be. They really know they're stuff on authenticity and as a Korean love they're food. The food here never disappoints. My fave place to drink soju. The service, the food the staff is always top notch here."
Namsan Korean Cuisine,Korean,"507 10 Street SW Calgary, AB T2P 2B8 Canada",AB,51.0487208,-114.0862962,4,"Korean food is not my thing but my son recommended this restaurant, and it did not disappoint.
The dish that impressed me most was the seafood pancake.  It was fluffy and light on top with a crunchy base.  One of the best I had, close to Han Corea's.
The bulgogi was average similar to all the other ones I had in Calgary and Edmonton..  The chicken in a gigantic pan was an interesting experience.
Side dish and rice was all you can eat.  And the side dish was good.  The server was really friendly and made you felt welcome and he was really accommodating.  The restaurant got another star because of him alone. The restaurant was in a remodeled home so it felt cozy.  We were lucky to sit by the window and it was really enjoyable."
Namsan Korean Cuisine,Korean,"507 10 Street SW Calgary, AB T2P 2B8 Canada",AB,51.0487208,-114.0862962,5,"I'm so glad I got to try Namsan, I was especially blown away by the seafood pancake. It's the best seafood pancake I've had thus far. My friend and I each got our own stew. If it's a spicy stew you best believe they make it legit spicy. Yukgaejang is my favourite Korean stew--I don't always see it offered at every Korean restaurant. There's a gmdsally good ratio of meat, noodles, veggies in Namsan's. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying other menu items.

The staff are all very friendly and sincere about their job. They work hard, especially considering the kitchen is on the first floor and the dining area is on the 2nd floor with only stairs in between."
Model Milk,Canadian (New),"308 17th Avenue Calgary, AB T2S 0A3 Canada",AB,51.0380416,-114.0693366,5,"This place was honestly a 10/10. I was recommended to go to Model Milk and it did not disappoint. I was only in Calgary for one night and I wanted a great restaurant to have a nice meal after spending the day in the mountains. We ordered the shrimp toasties to start, the burgers for the main, and the apple pie to split for dessert. Each menu item was fresh, innovative and expertly executed. I was also impressed that all the food was locally sourced from farms and even mentioned each farm on the menu. The shrimp toasties reminded me of lobster roll light and buttery. The burger was juicy, flavourful and the cheese curds were a great addition. The apple pie slice was generous and easily able to split with 2 people maybe even 3. With in house vanilla ice cream. The service was great and came in a timely fashion while answering all our questions. I highly recommend Model Milk."
Model Milk,Canadian (New),"308 17th Avenue Calgary, AB T2S 0A3 Canada",AB,51.0380416,-114.0693366,5,Great restaurant with excellent servers and a comfortable atmosphere. Tasty cocktails and food was overall good. The biscuits with the chicken were amazing but the chicken itself seemed abut overcooked however was not dry. We had a great time here.
Model Milk,Canadian (New),"308 17th Avenue Calgary, AB T2S 0A3 Canada",AB,51.0380416,-114.0693366,5,"I sat in the kitchens bar, the experience and aesthetic of it was excellent. I watched the kitchen work and prep food, and it made dinner a lot more enjoyable. The food selections was great and all were tasty. I finished with the model milk apple pie, simple yet yummy."
Model Milk,Canadian (New),"308 17th Avenue Calgary, AB T2S 0A3 Canada",AB,51.0380416,-114.0693366,5,"Had an excellent visit to Model Milk this week.  I was dining alone as I was in a work trip, and often this means I am mostly ignored.  Not at Model Milk!  Kate was fantastic ( as was every other server who stopped by to fill my water and check in on me ), even through the restaurant was packed.  My radicchio and endive salad with black garlic and sherry vinaigrette was spectacular, as was my hand rolled pumpkin cavatelli with smoked ham hock, sage and buttermilk.  Fantastic experience and can’t wait to go back!"
Model Milk,Canadian (New),"308 17th Avenue Calgary, AB T2S 0A3 Canada",AB,51.0380416,-114.0693366,5,"Model Milk was excellent.  We ordered Wagyu Beef Tartare & Calamari for appetizers; both were a great start of what's to come.  We also ordered Grilled AB Pork, Alberta Ribeye, and Halibut for entrees.  The Pork dish was divine; I highly recommend getting it.  It was probably one of the best pork dishes I have ever had.  The Ribeye was good and the Halibut was our least favorite.  It just didn't really shine.  Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant, the service and the ambience."
Ke Charcoal Grill & Sushi,Japanese,"1501 15th Avenue SW Calgary, AB T3C 0Y1 Canada",AB,51.0393469,-114.0949062,4,"I'm glad I stumbled on Ke Charcoal Grill & Sushi! We got a large order for a special occasion which included:
APPETIZERS --> Overall, these items were cooked well but did not stand out for me.
- Crispy spring roll (good amount of filling and had a thin crispy skin)
- Crispy gyoza (would have preferred the skin to be more golden brown for a better crunch)
- Fried shrimp cakes (unfortunately, these missed the mark - you would think these are just blended fish cakes)
- Truffle tater tots (the truffle was just right for me and was a nice touch to what would otherwise be just tater tots)
- Chicken karaage (the chicken was tender but otherwise, did not stand out particularly)
SUSHI & SASHIMI --> Overall, fresh and good balance of flavors, particularly the bluefin tuna roll. The thickness of the rolls was not too much for me and had a good ratio of rice to fillings to fish.
- Bluefin tuna roll (this was excellent - there was a nice citrus fragrance with each bite from the yuzu tobiko)
- Special roll platter (comes with 5 special rolls - the one that stood out the most was the truffle prawn roll which again carried a good truffle flavor that was not overpowering)
- Wild salmon, seared saba, and spicy salmon oshi sushi
- Chef's choice deluxe sashimi (16pcs)

Definitely recommend Ke Charcoal's seafood and will look forward to trying out their yakitori next time!"
Ke Charcoal Grill & Sushi,Japanese,"1501 15th Avenue SW Calgary, AB T3C 0Y1 Canada",AB,51.0393469,-114.0949062,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at KE Charcoal Grill & Sushi in Calgary, Alberta and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed. From the moment I walked in, I was welcomed by the warm and friendly staff who made me feel right at home. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, and I could tell that a lot of effort had gone into creating an authentic Japanese dining experience.

The highlight of my meal, of course, was the sushi. It was absolutely fresh and delicious. Each bite was a burst of flavor and I could tell that the ingredients were of the highest quality. The presentation was also beautiful, making each dish not just a treat for my taste buds but also for my eyes.

I must also mention the cleanliness of the restaurant. It was spotless and well-maintained, which is so important when it comes to food establishments. The attention to detail was evident in every aspect of my dining experience, and I felt confident in the restaurant's commitment to providing a safe and healthy environment for their customers.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend KE Charcoal Grill & Sushi to anyone looking for a delicious, authentic, and enjoyable Japanese dining experience. The friendly service, fresh food, and attention to detail make it a truly standout restaurant in Calgary. I cannot wait to go back and try more of their menu."

Although, ramen is not on their menu, the sushis made up for it. Best sushi and best grilled meat!!! 🫶🏻 this is worth it, a must visit 🍶"
Ke Charcoal Grill & Sushi,Japanese,"1501 15th Avenue SW Calgary, AB T3C 0Y1 Canada",AB,51.0393469,-114.0949062,4,"Came in for their Sunday dinner special, 20% all special rolls. Even without the deal, prices are already decently affordable! Personally, their sushis were average. I ordered a few torched rolls and find that they needed more torching, wasn't rather smoky enough.

Parking is very limited, they share parking with the restaurant next door. Has about 4-7 spots."

The menu is interesting as the chefs background is Singapore (on the moms side) and German (on the dad's side). The food was delicious, service was great, kitchen was fast. Will definitely be coming back."

Eggs Bennie with candied bacon was delicious. I’m not fond of Phil and Sebastian coffee. So that was the only thing I’d change. But the restaurant itself and staff are outstanding.

We ordered bit of everything like savory, sweets and side and we loved them all! Drinks with chia seed were very unique and i loved mine with pink! Staff was very kind!

The only thing kind of bothering me was the seats not having a enough space between which a lot of staff were walking pass and my friend who seats that side seems very distracted by each time when someone is walking pass."

Native Tongues Taqueria,Mexican,"235 12 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2R 1H7 Canada",AB,51.0413854,-114.0675588,4,"Came here for the first time during happy hour. Whilst the atmosphere and food were good, our service was not.
We had arrived right at 2, which at this point the restaurant was moderately busy, but by 2:30 it had mostly cleared out. Despite this slowdown, our server did not notify us of the specials, had to be chased down for more food and our bill as they continued to walk past us multiple times as we sat with empty plates. Our server also got our 4 taco order wrong, which it might have helped if they had actually written what we ordered.

I’m not sure if maybe they were just having a bad day cause the rest of the team ended up helping our server with clearing our plates, and serving our food. So bonus for the rest of the team.

Would only return cause food was bomb."
Native Tongues Taqueria,Mexican,"235 12 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2R 1H7 Canada",AB,51.0413854,-114.0675588,5,Came here for tacos but found out they make a pretty killer glazed donuts as well. If I had to pick some favorites it would definitely be the fish taco and the pork belly taco. If you want dessert go for the donuts! They are very big and very fluffy. Would definitely come back just for the donuts.
Native Tongues Taqueria,Mexican,"235 12 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2R 1H7 Canada",AB,51.0413854,-114.0675588,4,Pretty good tacos but not for the price. 6$ per piece and they aren’t large. The 3/4$ ones are super small. Good for lunch if you’re not too hungry.

Was in San Diego a week after I visited this establishment and I must say that the tacos here were quite competitive...large selection of foods to choose from, the overall design of this spot is quite lovely as well.

Staff super friendly and accomodating! I would highly recommend ending your meal with the Donas (donuts), good god are they good...its fluffy, sweet, and puts a smile on your face...quite succulent indeed, comparable to what you may feel when your parents give you words of affirmation you may have never recieved in your childhood (and later if applicable).

Definitely coming back."
Native Tongues Taqueria,Mexican,"235 12 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2R 1H7 Canada",AB,51.0413854,-114.0675588,5,"As someone from the States whose had tacos in California, Texas, and many other places known for Mexican food, Native Tongues is easily in my top 3 taco places of all time, maybe even number 1! Very high quality, authentic taste. The carnitas tacos were so flavorful and cooked perfectly. I had to stop myself after 4, but I wanted to keep eating them. The salsa taster was also amazing. I’ll definitely be back! The service staff did an incredible job as well. Much speedier and friendlier than servers in the States, and they were able to accommodate my food allergies with ease. I can’t say enough good things about this place. Stop reading my review and go eat! (I’d also like to add that the prices are extremely reasonable.)"

The food is not only delicious but also visually stunning at first glance. The cocktail selection is exquisite, offering refreshing options that tantalize the taste buds. The jazz group that entertained us throughout our visit was absolutely fantastic, creating a truly remarkable gastronomic and musical experience. We were wise enough to make a reservation, as the place is small and fills up quickly. It is without a doubt 100% recommendable."

I was just here for my birthday dinner and the raclette dish was amazing! Although the food was delicious what was even better was our server Coral! She was SO GOOD and went out of her way to give us excellent service. The menu was well put together and the food all looked and tasted delightful.

The only thing that’s keeping this review from five stars is the long wait time. It took nearly 45 minutes for the food to come out even though there was only one other family seated. The price is also a little high but not too bad. Overall, had a great experience here."

The customer service was excellent, extremely helpful in making selection of what to eat. Thank you Sam for all your help. The green curry chicken was exceptional. The papaya salad was yummy with a bit of a kick. I did enjoy the sweet and sour Basa."
Khao San Thai Kitchen,Thai,"1314-17 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2T 0C3 Canada",AB,51.037949,-114.0925421,4,"Nice patio, excellent food.
We had the spring rolls (they serve them in shot glasses with sweet chili which feels weird) and the chicken pad Thai.
The pad Thai was one of the best ones I’ve had, I really enjoyed it. Others at our table had a red curry, drunken noodles and the papaya salad. All had good things to say about the food.
The one downfall - we were there for almost 2 hours, the service is quite slow.
I did really enjoy the food and will definitely be back,  but would recommend you make sure you schedule enough time to enjoy the meal there."
Khao San Thai Kitchen,Thai,"1314-17 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2T 0C3 Canada",AB,51.037949,-114.0925421,4,"Tom kha was really really good, loaded with flavor with a hint of spiciness. The red curry with beef was good and flavorful, but I thought the beef was quite tough and chewy, I would recommend a different meat. Chicken pad thai was also decent. It was just a bit bland, it could have used more sauce. Chicken was a bit overcooked as it was chewy and a bit tough. Otherwise, this is a decent Thai place in Calgary."
Khao San Thai Kitchen,Thai,"1314-17 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2T 0C3 Canada",AB,51.037949,-114.0925421,5,"Great service, ambience and incredible food.

Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ,Japanese,"100-638 6th Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2P 0S4 Canada",AB,51.047944,-114.0759597,4,"Arrived 3 pm on a Sunday afternoon. Booking ahead of time.
Waitress seemed to be preoccupied with the other tables, so we waited a while to be greeted.
Ordered the Value course for 2 people, my kids had one order of Tonkotsu ramen each.

The food was quite delicious, many flavors of  sauces and garlic butters to enhance your meal.
I gave 2 🌟 for the ambience, the restaurant felt small, the windows were not cleaned. (In and out). The roof was comprised of large air ducts painted black, with pieces of hanging tape holding it together in various places.

Overall a good experience, prob will be back."
Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ,Japanese,"100-638 6th Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2P 0S4 Canada",AB,51.047944,-114.0759597,5,"I've been to many BBQ places and most of them are all you can eat but Gyu-Kaku (Although not all you can eat) has to be one of the best grilled BBQ places I've ever been too.

The atmosphere was great, and the service was excellent. I was served by Aubrey and she did a fantastic job and made sure to take care of literally everything I needed. Huge side note, I have allergies to all nuts and Aubrey made sure that the products I ordered were all nut free and made sure my station was all clean and sanitary!

I would 100 percent recommend coming here, bring anyone/everyone and im sure they'll love it too.

Lastly, this facility has super top quality chocies of meat so I can definitely say that it's worth every penny, especially on happy hour (HH)

Thank you to Aubrey! I will be back and will bring as much friends and family I can to share the joy!"

They are offered in Mother’s Day deal. The manager Aubrey said that was what they got. Now I’m curious about the quality of the meat they sell.

Donna Mac,Canadian (New),"1002 9th Street SW Calgary, AB T2R 0B5 Canada",AB,51.043721,-114.0836927,5,"A personal Calgary favourite. Their food is always delicious and they have some the friendliest staff. We usually dine in (which is great because their tables are really spacious and well laid-out) but we dined on their dog friendly patio for the first time and it was great. They have tall wood fences surrounding the outdoor seating area, which makes you feel less like you’re eating on the sidewalk."
Donna Mac,Canadian (New),"1002 9th Street SW Calgary, AB T2R 0B5 Canada",AB,51.043721,-114.0836927,3,"We visited Donna Mac on Sun afternoon for brunch. I loved their interior, decor was so beautiful and elevated! I had Turkish eggs, it came with lemon yogurt sauce with lots of herb like dill, I liked it so much more than hollandaise sauce, it was fresh, light and delicious. The chick peas were also seasoned well and goes well with the yogurt sauce. Sourdough was chard nicely, it was delicious, I recommend if you are looking for something light as I was still hungry after eating it. I also tried fried chicken, it was crispy and heavily seasoned, borderline too salty but I enjoyed it. Carrot cake was also good, it came with beautiful sweet carrot chips with caramelized walnuts, cake was not too sweet and icing has saltiness to it, and it was beautifully presented on a cute plate! I personally am not a big fan of very moist cake and this cake was a bit too most, and it was too much icing to cake. It was $11 and I thought it was not worth the price.

My friend had beet pastrami sandwich, I LOVED this sandwich, it had a lot of beets and a lot of flavors, 100% recommend! But I wish it came with some side, side fries are $7, the price is as same as appetizer item - Zaatar fries, I personally thought add on side items should be smaller potion and more affordable price, but it is just my personal opinion.

One thing we felt like need an improvement was that the beet pastrami sandwich was not listed as vegetarian item and it also said ‘ask for VEG’ meaning, ask for vegan option. We found it a bit confusing as we initially thought it was ‘beef’ pastrami as it did not have vegetarian icon on the menu.

Also our server did not come back after she delivered food, when there were only 2 other tables when we were eating.

I loved their flavors, I’d love to come back for dinner time!"
Donna Mac,Canadian (New),"1002 9th Street SW Calgary, AB T2R 0B5 Canada",AB,51.043721,-114.0836927,4,"Drink (long island) - 8/10, not much of a cocktail drinker but this was refreshing and not too sweet.

Croquettes - 9/10, crunchy exterior, smooth interior, accompanying sauce makes it one of the best appys.

Rotating bread - 8.3/10, last time I came I enjoyed the bread rotation they had more. Depends on what bread they have that day

Za'atar fries - 9/10, crispy fries that are still soft on the inside. Wish they had more sauce. Large amount of fries for the price

Salad - didn't eat. great portions, pictures don't do it justice, the salad was piled high.

Steak - 7.9/10, steak was well cooked, puree and toppings paired well with the steak. Didn't like that the caramelized onions were whole in this dish, quite sweet. Small portion of steak for the price.

Mac and cheese - 7.5/10, pasta was cooked well, did not like the excess of the crunchy topping.
Cookie with cream - 8.5/10, soft and sweet cookie and the cream helps cut some of the sweetness. Great end to the meal

Service - 7.8/10, service was good, water was filled a couple times throughout the night.

Atmosphere - 9/10, comfortable seating, interior design is nice (plants, colour palette, open kitchen design), lighting could be just a tad brighter but that's more of a personal preference. On the rare occasion there are times where it can get loud and you have to somewhat shout to be able to hold a conversation."
Donna Mac,Canadian (New),"1002 9th Street SW Calgary, AB T2R 0B5 Canada",AB,51.043721,-114.0836927,5,"Great experience. I hadn’t heard of Donna Mac but was invited for brunch by my family.

Walking up to the restaurant, it looked open and inviting especially with all of the windows.

Walking in, I was pleasantly greeted even though the server was a little busy I knew I had her attention enough so that she could finish with the client she was already helping and she attended me directly after assisting the other patron. I don’t think she felt rushed either, because it seemed her needs were met and the server moved on.

I was seated promptly as she seemed to know exactly were my family was but I didn’t feel like an annoyance even though I was about five minutes late for our reservation.

Our table server was prompt with asking for my drink order and exposing the menu. She was polite and didn’t rush me for my order.

We had a few brief questions that were answered exactly which made our orders go through quicker.

While waiting on our food we all commented on the decor of the restaurant. It’s such a big and open space but they were still able to make it feel cozy and comfortable. There was a brunch rush going on but we weren’t bothered by ambient noise and I felt like there was adequate enough that we didn’t have to worry about eavesdropping.

The food service was prompt and the plating was great. Each serving plate was different and retro and the food fit it well with the portions.

I had the pirogies with pork belly and it was fantastic. Our table shared their house salad with fresh greens and mushrooms with a perfect amount of dressing on it.

Unfortunately there were no leftovers because the food was portioned properly. We had enough to fill ourselves and maybe two more bites.

I will be back for the service, food, ambiance."

Would highly recommend the beef tongue and chicken knees. Go out on a limb and try something unique! Definitely a must try. Beautiful decor in the place as well, Wall murals (pictured), and the menu is great (also pictured). Mushroom dishes are also delicious, as are the Ramen and salmon dishes. Everything we tried is pictured. Thanks, will definitely come back!"
Shokunin,Japanese,"2016 4th Street SW Calgary, AB T2S 1W3 Canada",AB,51.0349168,-114.0713453,4,"I would say for the price point, most food are on the saltier side. Great with alcohol pairing, which is what this joint is about. But not when you don’t drink and just want to have some skewers.
Seating is very crowded, I got kicked constantly by the server walking past by without any sorry offered. Don’t feel so great but he doesn’t seem to notice that he’s kicked my chair multiple times. Or he doesn’t care, I wouldn’t know.
Would I come again? Maybe? if I’m drinking next time with a few friends…"

There's been a bit of a struggle with a good allergy both times, despite mentioning it in the reso, & was even told they 'weren't aware of an allergy' by our server most recently, despite an email conversation the day before. Will go back, but definitely watch your food if you have allergies."
Shokunin,Japanese,"2016 4th Street SW Calgary, AB T2S 1W3 Canada",AB,51.0349168,-114.0713453,4,"Had the omakase tonight. To be honest omakase here is not like typical omakase at other Japanese restaurants I have been to. It's more like a set menu dinner, since the food was not served by the chef, instead the server served it. The skewers are pretty good, the other food is normal. The drink pairing is not really ideal IMO.
Overall, I won't recommend the omakase here. But it's still a good place to order some skewers and drinks on the regular menu, hang out with friends etc. I would definitely come back."
Shokunin,Japanese,"2016 4th Street SW Calgary, AB T2S 1W3 Canada",AB,51.0349168,-114.0713453,5,"Really delicious food here. I had the Chicken heart, Neck, and the squid dish which was all delicious. The beer was good and the service was nice.

I have been here twice and both the time the food was awesome and so were the drinks! The stand out dish was the butternut squash ravioli with prawns! Its so creamy and buttery and there is this right amount of nutty flavour with the pine nut in it and the prawns just cooked right! Both the vegetarian dishes we tried were exceptional! Did not expect those 2 dishes to be that great!
The ambience and the staff here are really great and friendly!"

We went out around 10 pm which had happy hour price. For the food, we ordered the steak frites (25$) and it tasted great. For the drink we ordered Hey Hibiscus, and Hula Hula. 🥰🍸🍹
The restaurant is dimly lit with chill music and many seat available for couple. The server was so nice and professional with our order. The food arrive under 10 mins which is fast compare to many fancy restaurants. ✅💯
Highly recommend for couple nights or anniversary. 💯😍😋"

They got lots of great menu items, but don’t sleep on the chicken tender Bellini combos. Those chicken tenders slap. This location had a surprising amount of garbage blown in by the wind outside the front door area but I’m gonna take that as a one off situation, can’t control the wind ya know. The service was awesome. They even gave a free cheesecake to my girlfriend for her birthday, can’t be mad at that. Anyways get the chicken tenders, they will make you happy. These chicken tenders are for adults don’t worry. Classic."

This is up there with Rouge as one of the tastiest meals I have ever tasted. We NEED to talk about the butternut squash ravioli with prawns! It melts in your mouth, it is so creamy and buttery and it'll have you having a Ratatouille moment in the restaurant. The prawns tasted just like lobster, it was insane! We also had the steak, and the lettuce wraps. Everything was divine
The ambience and the staff here are really great and friendly! All the waitress were so friendly, there was this AMAZING (I'm assuming manager cause she was giving boss babe vibes) who called us movie stars.
Even though this location is so busy our food and drinks came on record time. The poor bartender was the only one working but it was not even a wait at all and the drinks were so good too!!
OHMYGOSHHH I can't give this location enough stars"
LOCAL Public Eatery,Canadian (New),"310 8th Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2P 1C1 Canada",AB,51.0458265,-114.0685829,5,"My husband and I were in downtown Canada and came to this place for a late lunch. We dined outside coz it was a beautiful day. the place was clean and we were seated right away when we got there. I ordered the Local Fried Chicken and an iced tea while my husband had a burger with small potato wedges on the side and a fried egg. I also ordered a side of Jasmine rice to go with my chicken. I am giving the food 4 stars because although the food was good something in the flavor is missing. The flavor is good but not quite, for both the burger and the local fried chicken. Also, the Jasmine rice took a while to be served. We loved our hostess Rachel. She was friendly and smart and seems like she genuinely enjoyed talking with us, not just because it is a part of her job. The atmosphere, when we dined outside was great. I definitely recommend this place. Although I find the place pricey, it is still a must try."
LOCAL Public Eatery,Canadian (New),"310 8th Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2P 1C1 Canada",AB,51.0458265,-114.0685829,5,"Amazing service from start to finish.

I let the server know I'm hard of hearing and she ushered us to the quieter back of the restaurant and turned down the music.

I could tell they were working hard to accommodate my allergy. Out of nowhere, they comped our appetizer for no other apparent reason than 'they were all feeling happy '.

The server even remembered our names.

The food was delicious, the portions were generous,  the prices were reasonable and the menu was very creative without being overwhelming. I think there was something there for everyone.  I recommend the shrimp dumplings!

What a lovely experience. 😍"

We tried the enchiladas. They were tasty but the portion was small. And mind you, the chicken stuffing is on top so the enchiladas itself do not have any meat. We also tried the Malaysian curry bowl which was okay. It had an after taste that I wasn’t sure I liked. The server was very sweet and considerate."

El Furniture Warehouse,Bars,"107 Stephen Ave SW Calgary, AB T2P 1B4 Canada",AB,51.0453335,-114.0635759,3,"So really nothing special to see here. Typical dark wood, low light Stephen Avenue restaurant/bar. I ordered a beef dip and it was okay, but if I went back I wouldn't order it again.

My friend ordered chicken tacos but asked first if they were spicy because he's not a big fan, and he was told no they were mild. They turned out to be quite spicy.

Their food prices are very very low compared to anywhere else on that street, but the old saying you get what you pay for definitely applies here.

Service was about as mediocre as the food. It wasn't bad, it wasn't great. Just enough to get by."
El Furniture Warehouse,Bars,"107 Stephen Ave SW Calgary, AB T2P 1B4 Canada",AB,51.0453335,-114.0635759,5,Yup! We were fortunate enough to get a seat on the patio and enjoyed the atmosphere.  Service was great (it was really busy) and the food was excellent. They provide tremendous value for what get for meals. Definitely try the burger and tacos if you're in the mood for something to eat.
El Furniture Warehouse,Bars,"107 Stephen Ave SW Calgary, AB T2P 1B4 Canada",AB,51.0453335,-114.0635759,1,"My recent visit to El Furniture Warehouse left me utterly disappointed and dissatisfied. I had ordered the General Tao Cauliflower Bowl, and from start to finish, the experience was nothing short of frustrating.

Firstly, the service was incredibly slow. It took a staggering 40 minutes for our order to be brought out, and only after we inquired about its status. The lack of attentiveness from the waitress was evident, and it seemed like the order was entirely forgotten.

When the waitress finally brought out my meal, I was taken aback by its appearance. The dish did not look like cauliflower as I had expected. I raised this concern with the waitress, and she took another trip back to the kitchen to double-check. Upon her return, she assured me that it was indeed cauliflower, dismissing my doubts rather casually.

Due to the extensive wait, my friends and I had already decided to pack the food into to-go boxes as soon as it was served. This made it impossible for me to try the food on the spot and identify the issue immediately.

It was only when I got back to the office and began eating the meal that I realized the dish I had been served was not cauliflower, as advertised, but instead chicken. This revelation was particularly distressing to me as I cannot consume chicken for religious reasons.

This experience was incredibly upsetting and disrespectful, as it not only wasted my time but also disrespected my dietary restrictions. The lack of care and attention to detail from the staff is unacceptable, and I am deeply disappointed by the entire ordeal.

I will certainly not be returning to El Furniture Warehouse, and I advise anyone with dietary restrictions or a desire for efficient service to steer clear of this establishment. The misrepresentation of dishes and the disregard for customers' needs make it clear that this restaurant falls far short of the dining experience one should expect"
El Furniture Warehouse,Bars,"107 Stephen Ave SW Calgary, AB T2P 1B4 Canada",AB,51.0453335,-114.0635759,5,Jill was our server and was very efficient and helpful! Great place with amazing prices. Would recommend for drinks and quick food either on the patio or late night inside.
El Furniture Warehouse,Bars,"107 Stephen Ave SW Calgary, AB T2P 1B4 Canada",AB,51.0453335,-114.0635759,5,"A fun and cozy place to stop for a bite on Stephan Ave!  It is a busy place and it's for good reason.  Inside you will find unique upcycled décor that gives a rustic yet fun ambiance where there are so many pieces to look at.  Still, there is also a comfortable feeling where you have walked into a place that is warm and welcoming.

Our server was just that to our little group.  She clearly knows how to give good customer service.  She knew the menu inside and out, gave good suggestions, and was patient with us when we were not sure what to have when an item of the menu wasn't available.  However, with great cheer, she announced that something was back and got what we ordered.  Despite being busy, our server checked in with us and was very speedy when it came to getting our meals.

Our meals were absolutely delicious.  It was impressive to see that such good food wasn't so crazy expensive when we ordered it.  There was a little nervousness that the dishes were going to be smaller than what we had thought due to the price.  However, this was not the case at all.  Things here were a good sized and sated our hunger perfectly.

What we ordered was a couple of power-bowls and some garlic cheese sticks as an appetizer.  The power-bowls were fresh, flavourful and full of amazing textures.  We had some tang and zip thanks to the dressing.  The vegetables had a lovely crunch and crispiness where it should.  The rice was perfectly cooked and the protein added created a nice balance to the whole thing.  The garlic cheese bread was a pleasant temperature and with all that melted cheese made a person have the kind of comfort that food should bring.  The marinara sauce that came with it was a little cool but the tomato, basil savouriness more than makes up for it.

If you are looking to have a nice night out with a loved one but have a budget that you must keep, this is the place to go.  This is a place that is good for a date night, birthday party with friends, or you are taking in a play at one of the theatres near by.  Check in today because you will leave feeling happy."

It was almost empty, a could count more staff members then people at the tables! We just skipped brunch rush and it wasn't quit dinner time yet.
I would say it was perfect timing.
Brunch/ lunch menu was served.
1/4 chicken and brisket sandwich were amazing.
The wood stove smell just made it all better. I love open kitchen, you can see everyone doing their thing and preparing for the dinner time.
Our server was outstanding and he mentioned that mostly works nights so hopefully we can run into him again sometime for the dinner!"

We got multiple steak tartares for the table and it changed my life! It was so gooood, would highly recommend. I got the lamb sirloin and it was so tender and yummy and my partner got the bison and really enjoyed it! If you’re debating between the lamb special or the lamb sirloin, I would definitely recommend the lamb sirloin. Good portion sizes too! Will definitely come back when we visit!"

Atmosphere was good, food was delicious and the staff were very welcoming and nice.

I ordered the brunch burger, and it was messy but worth it, and also subbed my fries for their sweet potato fries.

The burger was loaded, but super fresh, juicy and full of flavor and texture.

I wish the sweet potato fries came with a side of sauce like a Chipotle mayo of some sort, but overall I definitely recommend!"

We started with a side of sweet potato chips ... so tasty and crisp! We both had the pulled pork burger, the special for the day; mine on a lettuce wrap.  It was a bit messy to eat but somehow the best meals are :)
The crisp pickle and smattering of additional chips on the side made for the perfect start to our Calgary visit.  Many thanks Holy Grill!"

We got Burger and chicken panini. Burger was super juicy, it came with onion rings and few pieces of beet root fries. Chicken panini was huge and tasty. We even got plate of fries and coffee on the house. They said they were gonna dump all the coffee so offered free coffee. Same thing with fries. They said they were gonna use up all the fries so gave us free fries. I don’t think any business do that these days. I recommend this place for brunch/breakfast."

Everything we tried was really good and the tastes and textures of every food was unique and so delicious. The calamari and shrimp pasta is a MUST! I have tried lamb in various restaurants but this was the first time that even though it was medium rare it did not taste like bloody meat and was actually really tender, juicy, and well cooked all at the same time.

The service was really good too and the atmosphere of the restaurant was very inviting and lively. Definitely recommend reserving in advance as it was busy. Since we had come here for a birthday dinner, there was a cute birthday card signed by the staff, which was a thoughtful touch. Will be back for sure."

But since we ordered both, it became all too much cheese. 🤪 also tried their cocktail - paradise city, it tasted great for people who like sweet cocktails. Their beetroot salad was okayish and can be skipped. For next time, I will be trying their pasta as it’s really hyped by others in the reviews. The chicken liver mousse was okayish as well."

They have limited patio seating, but the bar area opens wide to the great outdoors.

Rigatoni was definitely the star of the show, everything else was tasty as well. We also ordered the banana pie (yum!) But at this point we had too much to eat to really enjoy the dessert. Dinner was reasonable priced considering the ambiance and food quality. Attentive to my big pregnant belly and my needs :).

I ordered the butcher shop steak and the “salad”was pretty dull. A few greens placed on top of the steak and thin sliced carrot and radish. I left still hungry. Asked for no Parmesan and I believe my server who is from Moncton requested that as well, but it was brought out to me like that and I had to pick it off."

The grainy mustard gives a nice texture to the sandwich. I highly recommend lunch at charcut.

The meal we had was part of the YYC Eats events and it was a featured prime rib meal, with half a charcuterie board to start and maritozzi banana cream stuffed sweet brioche with powdered sugar for dessert. For our choice of side, we had the poutine.

This was a massive amount of food for 2 portions and all prepared well. We ordered the meat medium rare and that's exactly how it arrived. It also came with a clove of roasted garlic, rosemary jus and horseradish aioli.

The dessert was beautifully prepared and delicious.

For my drink I ordered the Marasca Spritz, which was lovely and refreshing. It was garnished with lime and brandied cherries.

Our server was attentive and polite. He attended to a couple of special requests without missing a beat.  He also kept our water glasses full throughout the meal without being asked. The food and drinks arrived in a timely manner and the pacing of the meal was spot on.

This is an excellent place for a special occasion or even just a nice supper out."

I even want to bring my friends here to try. I ordered Laksa noodle soup, Nasi with Rendang beef and Roti with curry chicken for 2 people.

The jumbo laksa is absolutely divine with a combination of all the different laksa dishes. It's a great way to try the different meat and tofu options with a broth that unbelievably delicious. We shared between 4 people and it was more than enough. My Malaysian mom was impressed with the laksa and continues to bring visitors to show them a glimpse into her roots involving authentic cuisine. Would definitely recommend finishing up with a shaved ice dessert!

The dishes were just okay and the flavour was not what you would expect in good Malaysian food . I have had much better Malaysian food in few other restaurants in Calgary. Tried the chicken popcorn starter which was just like any store bought chicken popcorn.. the rendang beef was just okay ..
Mamak Dang Fusion Malaysian Cuisine,Malaysian,"4604 12th Street NE Calgary, AB T2E 4R4 Canada",AB,51.0935579,-114.0328605,4,"Good place to eat. I'd say it is more Chinese style Malaysian. The food was good, definitely recommend the chicken curry nasi lemak. The beef rendang was a little disappointing - missing the toasted coconut flavour and it was much wetter than what I had in Malaysia. Still decent and the beef was tender. Both nasi lemak dishes had delicious coconut rice, roasted peanuts, sambal, perfectly boiled egg and more.

I really enjoyed the honey chrysanthemum drink, definitely recommend that for a refreshing drink.

The staff were great and fast. Prices were quite fair for the quality and amount of food. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Mamak Dang!"

The restaurant cooks the halal food in different pots/pans than the rest of the menu to avoid cross contamination — very considerate!

I ordered the baked lasagna which was very delicious and a friend had ordered veal Parmesan. The friend had mentioned that her veal was tough and chewy, but I had no complaints of my lasagna. The orders came with complimentary bread and butter — which is just ok , not amazing but not bad

Atmosphere/decor is nicer than most restaurants in NE and it feels like you’re in a small, cosy family owned restaurant. Would come back again"

The Cluck Norris is a chicken sandwich that tastes like Thanksgiving and is served with a hefty amount of waffle fries.

The Holy Crab was an eggs Benedict that was good, but the crab was a little bit too salty.

The banana cream pie french toast was good and ""tasted like my mother's banana pudding"". The thick cut bread was a little dry in the center, but otherwise, it was good.

The Soul in a bowl breakfast poutine was tasty and was exactly as described.

Overall, I would recommend OEB for when you are looking for a tasty and quick breakfast in downtown Calgary."

We went there after walking around downtown, Prince's Island and were ravenous. Service was amazing and rather fast, decor is quirky and cozy at the sametime, probably because we sat in the egg like enclosure. My first time eating poutine, veg options are plenty. They have an option to request that the potatoes be fried in veg oil instead of beef tallow, our waitress took care of that request for our table."
OEB Breakfast,Breakfast & Brunch,"222 5 Avenue SW Suite 110 Calgary, AB T2P 4K3 Canada",AB,51.0488849,-114.0654338,4,"Poutine!! For the love of poutine.

I came for their French toast or waffles. But I left actually loving their poutine. I hate/ dislike poutine. Or all things with fries. First place!!!

Place was cute and inside a very busy bustling building across from stock exchange and Bow steer building. I didn't make reservations so I couldn't sit inside , rather got seated at their outside patio/ inside the building area. Completely different vibes than their restaurant.

Minus that: food is the same. I got their trifle French toast and gold diggah poutine. They didn't have any lattes but just drip coffee. So drip coffee it is.

I had no expectations for their poutine but turns out to be the most delicious thing I've ever had! I got it with half arugula and it was Irit mind blowing good. The jiggly runny egg, lemony sauce! Super tasty chicken. Bitterness of the arugula cutting the fries. It was the best / only poutine I've ever ordered AND consumed! I've ordered many before without eating.

The French toast trifle was fun too. Coffee was a ok. Couldn't get a refill. Our waitress was quite busy inside. Bummer.

But! Since I've tested the best poutine ever: I'm giving them 4 stars. I'll never poutine anywhere else. The best!!! Only thing missing is a latte!! Or a much stronger coffee."

I know that chopped meat with small bones can fried. However I also doubt that the chopped meat with crushed bones be fried. Due to the fried coating, I didn’t know the crushed bone.

If it would have been homemade sausages for appetizer but it’s just the Walmart Bratwurst or the tiny portion of Käsespätzle!! Schnitzel was pork not veal.

Wiener-Schnitzel Haus,Austrian,"4703 Bowness Road NW Calgary, AB T3B 0B5 Canada",AB,51.0727272,-114.1612684,2,"This was a disappointing experience as it was so overpriced! The owners are friendly, the atmosphere is nice, but you can only order a two, or three course meal. One does not know that when trying to look up the menu online. This boils down to around $30 for a few cheese wrapped asparagus spears, or a bowl of goulash soup as an appetizer taken the average price of a schnitzel on their earlier menu. The very limited operating hours might be a reason for the overpriced menu, but there is too much competition out there. Unfortunately we won't be back."

The atmosphere, the coffee quality and the options. We ordered the specialty crab cakes Benny on a croissant, prawn and bacon Benny, and avocado toast. All were delicious but the crab cakes were the star of the show, super fresh and flavourful, and loved how they put it on a croissant as opposed to the standard English muffin. Would definitely recommend coming here a bit early to get a parking spot as it is quite limited but well worth the hassle. Will definitely be coming again to try out their other items and cocktails!"

They are located in up Edmonton trail, in industrial area. Don’t let the location fool you because once you open the door, there is fun and beautiful restaurant with awesome bar and the best brunch!

My favorite is Queen’s breakfast. It comes with sweet and savory in one plate, if you cannot decide what to order, I 100% recommend you to order this one. Their potato is not like other brunch places, it is crispy outside and fluffy inside, rusty shape gives a lot of texture. I like how they cook eggs, they do not ask how you like the eggs but they always cook eggs perfectly.

What I love the most is their ricotta pancake and waffles. It is so soft, fluffy, flavorful. You cannot find something like this in any other restaurant in Calgary, it is worth trying.

Their cocktails are also amazing, it is small but always delicious."

I recently visited Blue Star and had a good experience overall. The ambiance was quite nice, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The restaurant had a pleasing aesthetic that added to the dining experience.

The taste of the food at Blue Star was delightful. The flavours were well-balanced and satisfying.

The size is a little small

Overall, my visit to Blue Star was a positive one. The combination of good taste, pleasant ambiance, and attention to detail made it a memorable dining experience. Excellent customer service ☺️"
Blue Star Diner,Diners,"809 1st Avenue NE Calgary, AB T2E 0C2 Canada",AB,51.0530973,-114.044847,4,Casual diner with friendly and hardworking staff. Good Vegan and Vegetarian options to choose from. They run different offers throughout the week. Ordered the Vegan burger and it tasted great. Came with fries and pickles on the side. Burger was massive and tasted good. The Vegan sauce could have been a bit better in my opinion. Fries were crunchy but a little overdone and tasted a little bitter.

It was easy to get on the wait list through Google Maps, and even though the estimated wait time was 30 mins, we got a table in around 15! Great service. Their machine's tip options start at 18% and the tip suggestion at the bottom of the bill was a little aggressive? I've never noticed any other establishment add a tip suggestion at the bottom of the bill before...

I got the breakfast poutine and it was tasty but it was also extremely salty. I went through many cups of water during my meal. I'm not used to eating food with a lot of salt in it, so it came off very strong. The flavour was excellent. I think just thr combination of gravy, salt on the fries, and salty meat in the poutine altogether made the saltiness too much for me.

My friend got an eggs Benny. She said it was tasty but the tomatoes made the bread underneath kind of soggy. I've never been a fan of bennies for that reason haha."

Drinks are delicious. The buffet has a huge variety and everything we had was phenomenal. The various meats are brought to your table and we were able to get through all 12 (or so) without getting overly full, and we are not big eaters. Each meat was uniquely prepared and would be a great entree in its own. My favs were the sirloin cap, beef ribs, and the grilled pineapple (yes, not a meat). The presentation is amazing, as the servers bring the meat on spits and slice off pieces for you at the table. Just so good."

It has one of the best salad bar at any Brazilian steak house serving both cold and hot food. The best item is the fries pork belly!! Love it.

When it comes down to the meat.. it has to be the parmesan beef and chicken hearts!

Last night, Friday July 28 was the worst meal we have had! Not sure what happened but the sweet potato fries were very vinegary, we sent that back. Replaced them with regular fries which were overcooked. I had the Bruce Lee pizza, the crust was undercooked and floppy when you picked up a piece. It was very watery. My 92 year old father in-laws Pesto noodle dish at best was warm only.
We were very disappointed in the food. Will definitely seek out and support other local restaurants."

We were sat right at the windows overlooking the lake and provided with Prosecco to celebrate our special dinner.

What an amazing venue with a great view!  Its a beautiful restaurant with very nice decor.  Looking out to the lake provides a calming ambiance.

Our server Darcy was friendly, informative and fun.  He really took care of us, suggesting their best dishes, wines, cocktails and beers.  All of his suggestions were on point.

We ordered the small charcuterie platter, Rib Eye, the Tuna, Sticky Toffee Pudding, Gin and Tonic Cake, the Purple Rain Cocktail, Born to Rum cocktail, Foam Espresso Martini as well as wine, beer and a fine brandy.

All of the dishes and drinks exceeded expectations.  The flavours were refined, with great contrasting textures and beautiful presentation.  Its hard to narrow down my favourite, but the Sticky Toffee Pudding with the banana ice cream paired so well with the brandy, I thought I was in heaven.

We really had an amazing evening here, and just wish we had the time to experience the other dishes.  The Happy Anniversary chocolate plaque was so thoughtful!

The service was terrible, immediately upon arriving our server was rude, and she made no effort at all to be polite or professional throughout out meal.

On top of that, they were ""all out"" of several meals and drinks, which is hard to believe on a Friday right before a weekend, which I imagine would be a busier time for the restaurant. As someone who works in the industry, this was incredibly disappointing.

Their hours on the door said open til 9 on Fridays, but they seemed to want us out at 8. We had gotten there at 7 so it isn't like we came right before closing and expected full service.

I was here on a double date with my girlfriend and another couple, and after our terrible experience my girlfriend tipped $2 and the other couple tipped $0, which I think was fair based on the level of terrible service but then another woman (the manager/owner maybe?) came to our table after and told the other couple to at least leave a few dollars for the server. That's super unprofessional and I've never experienced that at any restaurant or bar in Canada.

Overall would return for the food maybe for takeout, but would not want to deal with that terrible quality of service again."

The food and menu are not your typical fusion/American flare. They offer good tacos and burritos that taste fresh and have good flavours. I have visited a few times and it’s great every time.

What to order?
Burrito
Tacos
Chips n dip
Horchata"
La Bodega,Mexican,"318A 10th Street NW Calgary, AB T2N 1V8 Canada",AB,51.0548252,-114.0856158,3,"I was really torn with this review. For the most part the food was good and the service as well. The problem was that the guacamole tasted fishy.  On its own it’s not a big deal but then the waiter, when we brought it to his attention, tried to tel us that some of the ingredients are similar to ceviche (onion cilantro etc) so we just think it’s fishy.  My dad has lived in Mexico for part of the year for decades and I’ve spent a lot of time there.  I’ve had a lot of ceviche and a lot of guacamole.  Don’t try to pull one over on me.  Lack of stars is for the attitude. I did give them 3 not 2 stars because they did remove it from the bill without us asking."

Came here specificallt to vet their vegetarian options, I was pleasantly suprised at the depth of flavours provided. Impossible gyozas are lovely, quite comparable to the traditional pork variations. Further, the ramen broth is very flavourful and the spice may be adjusted with the provided chili oil and paste (packs a good punch). The staff are friendly and well prepared to answer questions.

Generally impressed with this location and am definitely coming back to explore the rest of their menu."

We will be back. Only point I can say is that only one pizza had pepperoni, which is normally a staple on pizzas, no gelato desert here, but a few other choices...parking across the street for a few buck, or complimentary around back for free, just let them know when you sit...to register your plate. A great place to eat out, not too expensive for a diner out downtown."

BeeFun hot pot,Vietnamese,"4640 MacLeod Trail SW Calgary, AB T2G 5E8 Canada",AB,51.0112606,-114.0645534,5,"This hotpot style comes from Guangdong (Canton) province in Southern China, where people use lightly favored broth to highlight the original yet subtly different flavor from multiple parts of the beef. You can often see people sitting at a casually set up table outside a butcher’s stand, spending half an afternoon slowly enjoying a beef hotpot served freshly from the shop.

We had a wonderful experience in this restaurant. First, this hotpot style requires impeccable beef quality as the broth will only magnify any flaw, and we are all very impressed. The owner/manager is super knowledgeable and keeps to a high standard for his raw materials.  As a bonus point, you’ll also see him walking around introducing each part of the meat and the best way to cook them — please do take his advices :)

We came all the way from San Francisco for this hotpot because we don’t have this style in the Bay Area. And it certainly didn’t disappoint us."

I got the homemade butterscotch coffee, which was awesome and perfect for a hot morning.

Then came back and had the kimchi omurice and the brekkie steak bites bowl. For drinks, we got strawberry real berry latte (no coffee) and the yuzu ade (also no coffee). Everything was delicious. I’d get everything a second time. Our fave was the steak bites bowl.

Wait staff was super nice and offered great recommendations. Looks like they have vegetarian and vegan options as well."

Unique and tasty spins on the usual breakfast eats. D is vegetarian and I am pescatarian, we had lots to choose from but settled on French toast, salmon eggs benny and a side of waffle fries. Coffee was hot n not weak. D’s strawberry fizzy drink was crisp and chugable. The staff were awesome and the food came out fast. Portions were plenty and we didn’t make it to desert.

They had enough seating. Got the lunch deal to go. I did feel the brisket option was quite pricy but the quality of the food and how delicious it was made it worth it. The sauces added were so good. I couldn’t get enough. The meat was tender and juicy. The cornbread was one of the best I had had.

Finding good BBQ in Canada is rare and this is one of the ones offering good clean flavours. Coconut corn bread was delicious. Only 2 sauce choices for now; the spicy one could have used more heat but were pleasant and mild for lunch.

I was headed to Tim Hortons but I really wanted somewhere I could sit down and get a drink and some real food, I couldn't have stumbled into a better place!! The decor is amazing, I got kind of a beachy surfer dive-y vibe and I love it. Super unique for a place in Calgary!

To drink I ordered the Bourbon tea cocktail and it was delicious. I got the second one in a taller glass because the first one was a little strong for me, but it was reeeeally good!

For food I got the BBQ bun with brisket and I must say, I was intimidated by the ingredients on the bun! (Onion rings, pickles, Cole slaw, and brisket on a bun together?! Idk....) I am not very adventurous with food, but I am super glad I tried it because omg it was amazing! I actually got a fork and ate the stuff that fell out of the bun. I highly recommend it!!

I had the opportunity to meet the owner and her wife, and I must say they are amazing. They provided me with incredible service and I didn't even know they were the owner and wife until I had a one on one chat with the owner after my meal. They are great ladies, not only will I tell everyone about this place but I'll definitely be back! Try this place out, you won't regret it.

We ordered the beef tartare and scallop ceviche to start. They were absolutely divine - the scallops were fresh with just the right amount of citrus. The beef tartare was amazing (we appreciate this so much more after being in London for the last few months, I can confirm that London beef is nowhere near as good as Alberta beef!).

For our mains my hubby and I got the mussels and frites - I was told the bread here was delicious and to get it in place of the fries, but our waiter was super nice and said I could have both 😂😂 - I honestly love it when they tell me this! I don't even think he charged us for the bread! Everything tasted super fresh!

Despite being super full, I ordered two desserts - creme brulee and the nougat with a passion fruit coulis. I'm so glad I made that the decision. They were both excellent.  The creme brulee was super creamy and eggy. The nougat was a surprise as it wasn't too sweet. It had a nice soft and chewy texture with some crunch to it from the added nuts. The passion fruit sauce was the perfect addition.

I'd definitely recommend this place, and I'm sure we will be back as well! We also had some fun filming through creme brulee!"

Cassis Bistro,French,"2505 17th Avenue SW Suite 105 Calgary, AB T3E 7V3 Canada",AB,51.0374194,-114.1181389,3,"I was underwhelmed by the food and the experience.
The host that sat us didn’t say a word to us, sat us down then only spoke to the table next to us before walking away. Started off weird. The waitress was nice, refilled water fast and answered questions.

The ravioli was good, and we got crème brûlée for dessert (best part of the evening) as the ratio was perfect, it was thin and wide.
The rest of the dishes were average and I didn’t find them particularly flavourful."

We were very impressed with the flavours and the service, and the prices seemed very reasonable compared to other Mexican places we have tried in the city. We especially enjoyed the Tacos al Pastor, we highly recommend them! We suggest adding an option for either ordering individual tacos or a different number than three, as it makes sharing between two people a little awkward."
Molcajete,Mexican,"1235 26 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2G 1R7 Canada",AB,51.0301759,-114.0349756,5,"I adore their delicious salsas, they have such an eccletic range and I love picking up new ones to try them out.

Also I had the burritos - wow very authentic and super tasty. Fairly well priced. Daniel and I were hungry and this was clean and tasty. Also Daniel bought a hot sauce and it was killer spice but tasty. We added to the tacos - delicious. Good job ladies working there to make the customers feel so so good don’t there. My first time for food and we were glad to be there. Good job.
Molcajete,Mexican,"1235 26 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2G 1R7 Canada",AB,51.0301759,-114.0349756,4,Love the authenticity behind this mexican place and all at a reasonable (calgary) price. Fresh food and made to order. They also own the shop across that is all about their handmade tortilla chips and a wide variety of sauces from simple salsa to super spicy. Well worth eating here. Flavours arent too strong but it tastes simple and home-like.

N9NA,Canadian (New),"121 17th Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2G 1H3 Canada",AB,51.037614,-114.062281,2,"Came here one evening when it wasn't very busy (maybe 4 tables in total).
Ordered a burger, sandwich and poutine, waited an hour for the food to come out. Which seems excessively long given it wasn't busy and was a simple order.

The burger was pretty bare and the bread was dry. The poutine cheese wasn't very good and wouldn't melt. Overall, the food wasn't great.

The server was kind and nice but didn't come by often at all. The atmosphere of the place is very cool, so enjoyed that aspect, but the wait for the food and subseqeuent quality of it really brought the rating down."
N9NA,Canadian (New),"121 17th Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2G 1H3 Canada",AB,51.037614,-114.062281,1,"Went in and there wasn't a single customer in the place on a Wednesday evening. Despite advertising wing nights on Wednesdays, when you go in, they'll tell you they are not discounted on Wednesdays but you are free to order a burger or full price wings. This sign stating wings on Wednesday has been up for months, they are aware it is incorrect but are keeping it up to get people to come in and buy full price burgers. Bait-and-switch.

Would strongly advise avoiding this restaurant and their shady practices."

One of Calgary’s BEST restaurants! They haven’t been around for over 20 years cause for any other reason, but that!

Up until recently their pricing was rock bottom low! As with so many recent events this was out of their control and they’ve raised their prices.

The main difference is many other restaurants raised their prices BEFORE this and are probably even HIGHER now! On top of using lower quality and lesser quantity food! That is NOT what they’ve done here!

We spend a LOT of money eating out and we notice and pay attention to these things!

Thai Tai is THE SPOT on early in the day or late at night and whether it’s HOT, cold, rain or shine, they’ve got something DELECTABLY DELICIOUS AND FRESH for you and yours!

The owners are ALWAYS friendly, welcoming and well beyond accommodating when it comes to any issues that do happen!

You can almost NEVER be disappointed coming here! Even if you are, they will take care of you if there is any issue!"

It's just not the same. It's soooo run down!!! Popped in today for first time in probably 5 years. My sub was not great at all and it's just ghetto inside. They need a complete reno and revamp. They opened 2 other stores, that never survived. This location seems to make it, but maaan, you need to put some money into a cleanup. The floors and windows are filthy, and that bathroom? Wow"
Pigeonhole,Cocktail Bars,"306 17th Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2S 0A8 Canada",AB,51.0380119,-114.0689151,5,"A great experience!  We had the prawn cocktail,  which was good but I probably wouldn't order it again, it didn't jump out as anything special.   Then we had the Beef Tartar, it was delicious and the presentation was perfect.   Following that, we had the charred cabbage and again it was awesome, full of flavor.    Somehow we had room for the chicken schnitzel, I have never had chicken made this way and it was stunningly good!  Finally our server, Justin, was super and made us feel welcome and was very relaxed.  He is a real asset that I hope the management appreciate.   We will be back!"

The exceptional service at The Pigeon Hole deserves applause. The servers were attentive, offering insightful recommendations while giving us ample space to relish our culinary journey. Justin was Justin-credible!

Highly recommended for a memorable dining experience.

Ps. Today was our second time in one week."

The croquettes and hamburger was very good but the Pancakes were too sweet for us. The service was very friendly and fast and the place very nice and clean. Only problem I had was how close the seating is. We didn't feel so comfortable and felt like we had to whisper between the 2 other couple dates next to us. I don't think I would come back unless I was in a big group and we can get the bigger stand alone table."
UNA Pizza + Wine,Pizza,"618 17th Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2S 0B4 Canada",AB,51.0379412,-114.0754813,5,"Great overall pizza.

I got the margarita pizza and I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly my order came to my table.

The pizza was very good. Crust was crispy, toppings were fresh, and Una offers a delicious chilli oil that you can add on your pizza to bring it all together. This pizza had everything you’d expect from a good overall pizza; fresh ingredients, tasty dough, and a nice crisp.

One of the top tier pizzas in the Calgary area."
UNA Pizza + Wine,Pizza,"618 17th Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2S 0B4 Canada",AB,51.0379412,-114.0754813,5,"Unique, high quality pizza, great wine choices and best cocktails in Calgary.

I had a chicken, pesto and sun dried  tomatoes pie which was perfectly balanced in flavor: crispy crust, just the right amount of chicken, zingy tomatoes and mouth watering basil. Yummy!

In addition to fabulous food the place spirts knowledgeable staff passionate about their craft: I ordered a cocktail that wasn’t on the menu and the barman knew the cocktail I ordered and delivered a perfect concoction. He even suggested to make a surprise cocktail which was equally delicious introducing me to a new favorite.

It is evident the staff is great, food and drinks amazing which results in a relaxing atmosphere guests enjoy and return to.

If you’re local or just visiting this restaurant should be on your list of top restaurants to eat in Calgary."

I have yet to be disappointed by anything I have tried here! There is something here for everyone and I am confident that whoever I bring will enjoy it. The Gnocchi Bianca is the best pasta I've ever had. I love any of the pizzas with their honey. The browned butter cauliflower was an absolute delight.

I wouldn’t call it the best pizzeria in town tbh.
On the bright side the garlic bread was really good."

I can not tell you how happy I was that it turned out to be delicious and veg. They suggested a couple things and I had never tried a Vietnamese sizzling crepe before. It’s a must! Wrap the crispy deliciousness in lettuce and add veggies, dip and enjoy. I couldn’t leave without the pad Thai because rarely do I get to enjoy this dish. I was impressed with every dish we were served and shared. Sadly my face was too stuffed to try the eggplant but my family couldn’t stop eating it, at the end my boyfriend tossed in the rice and devoured the last of it! The staff is excellent, everyone decided to come the same time and they handled it well. Hope you enjoy your eats 🤤"

And we ordered a bunch of stuff like spicy miso ramen, tonkotsu ramen, curry ramen, spinach miso salad, shrimp tempura, veggies tempura and gyoza.  The tempura were delicious, the breading were very light and they were fresh and hot.  I would say the favour ramens starting from the top, curry Raman, spicy miso ramen and then tonkotsu ramen.  The curry ramen and spicy miso ramen were very delicious.   The spinach salad was very good.   The gyoza was ok but I had better.   Over all experience was great however I had to wait a little longer for the tempura."
Menyatai Japanese Noodles,Japanese,"24 12th Street NW Calgary, AB T2N 1Y3 Canada",AB,51.0521766,-114.091705,3,"I had the spicy egoma ramen. Taste was okay, not the best, not the worst. Price was great at $15. I can handle spice, but this soup felt like someone shook some cayenne pepper and the lid fell off making the broth no longer tasty and effectively inedible. Noodles and toppings were tasty though."

Ambiance 4.5 - really nice room. Loved the vibe and the carpet design!

Cocktails 3.5 - didn’t like the “bats in the sky” but the fifth element cocktail was good.

Food 4.25 - shareable and really good in both presentation and taste. Mushroom toast was #1 by far. Brussels were good but not superb. Had a couple other dishes as well that were certainly in the 4 to 4.5 star range.

Would love to go back some day."

My drink was  ""As you wish"" from Princess Bride. It was way too tart for me. Didn't feel they balanced it with enough sugar though totally get ppl have different levels of accepting tartess. So that's fine. Just wasn't suitable for me.

Ordered clam linguine. Pasta was nicely al dente which I like but the chef forgot to put salt. And no, you can't say salt level differs and that hard to adjust to every person's taste. I use very very little salt and it had no flavour at all. Told the servers and asked them to bring salt which I never add to my cooked food but no choice. Servers didn't seem to care about my concern. They just oh sorry and that's pretty much it

And pasta had a lot of oil. Too much oil!

Was not impressed that I decided not to try their dessert which I had planned to try. Very disappointed!"

So overpriced breakfast, wish I had kept my $40 today. Specially for kids, we ordered the pancake plate and it's just little cakes no pancakes and it doesn't include the drink like most breakfast places so  $5 for a hot chocolate for the kid. My omelet had no salt or flavour, I had to abuse the salsa they gave me. Giving 3 starts just because the ambiance but definitely not going back. And hopefully they'll fix the doors in the ladies, haven't you seen how the two doors bump into each other? With those prices, definitely should be fixable."

This was a nice touch because their entryway isn't huge so being able to wait in your car without losing your spot was a plus.

The food was delicious and had lots of flavour and the portions were well worth the price. We had asked for a substitution on my fiance's meal and were told there wouldn't be a charge but then there was one. For a dollar, I didn't make a stink about it but wanted to note it as well.

A downside is that they don't offer glasses of water. You have to pay for a bottle of water which I think is a waste of plastic.

I would definitely go back though 😀"

I had the Japanese Wagyu and it was delicious! The meal came with lobster and scallops 😍 Totally worth the price for the quality and overall experience! Aldwin was our chef and he had our table laughing all night! Jennifer, our server, was friendly, helpful, and so nice 😄 can't wait to celebrate our next event here!!!"
OMO Teppan and Kitchen,Japanese,"5222 Macleod Trail SW Calgary, AB T2H 0J2 Canada",AB,51.0077936,-114.0678884,5,"Very good food and a good show (better than most).  They do sing the happy birthday song frequently.  There were obviously several people with birthdays, but it plays through the speakers in with the rest of the music like it was on a schedule.  It was a lively place!  The staff genuinely seemed to enjoy working there. We enjoyed our visit.

There is a $19 per person minimum.  The standard chicken hibachi meal with steamed rice is $35.  If you have a child that’s where you’ll encounter an issue.  Children generally don’t each much (mine don’t). So one person needs to get double fried rice or have the child order someone else’s sushi and appetizer and you’ll be set.  The staff were very accommodating."

We went to celebrate my kiddo graduating from grade 9, and we had such a blast!

The staff were all so friendly and seemed like they genuinely loved their jobs (which always makes a huge difference). Our chef was hilarious and great entertainment, and the food was to die for! I'm still mad I forgot to grab a bottle of the ginger sauce, that stuff was amazing.

All around 10 stars - we had a fantastic time, and this little picture they took and printed out for us was such a sweet little extra that we didn't expect!"

Received a phone call the night before asking for $200 deposit. Please ask at time of booking. The entertainment by Vince was great and the food was good. The time limit for a party of 12 wasn't long enough for the chef. Consider that by party size when booking. We were rushed out, which left a bad impression. The idea is great but top notch venues are all about the details."
Noodlebox,Asian Fusion,"9 Heritage Gate SE Calgary, AB T2H 3A7 Canada",AB,50.9879627,-114.04578,3,I had heard alot about this place so went and tried it but it was not upto my expectations. The food was fine. The menu concept is amazing. The price is a little high. Friendly staff. It just seems like there are too many spices in a single bowl.
Noodlebox,Asian Fusion,"9 Heritage Gate SE Calgary, AB T2H 3A7 Canada",AB,50.9879627,-114.04578,2,"Pad Thai has too much fish sauce for me. Maybe someone likes it and maybe it is their recipe so I don’t complain about this.
But my Kung Pao noodle was totally not cooked. They use thick udon noodles. Then they have to blanch the noodle first because this noodle is too thick. When I had this noodle, the inside was cold. If all these franchises use the same recipe, I will not visit again."

It's so creamy and has amazing flavours. I love that I can substitute out the fish sauce and cilantro. I love the variety of flavours and dishes available to me (gf and vegan).

Was greeted, sort of, as I was at the counter and then started to order when the employee decided to answer the phone while I was in mid sentence. He didn't say anything to me as he answered the phone. Approx 4 minutes later, still standing there and just about to leave, one of the other 3 employees ( who were talking to each other the entire time) asked if he  could help. I placed my order and when the food arrived at the table I was at, it looked pretty damn  good! Well....as I was 1/2 way through the Pad Tai, I started to have major food regret and could not eat another bite. Stupid me, I decided to check the nutritional information and subsequently regretted doing so. There was so much sodium in the dish to get me through the entire day! Well...2 hours later, lying on the couch so bloated I felt I could float away, I swore I would write a review of my experience. Will never return to Noodlebox!!"

Rouge,French,"1240 8 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2G 0M7 Canada",AB,51.0423216,-114.0336807,5,"We came to Rouge for a special occasion. It's a small, quaint historical home situated in Inglewood. The atmosphere is relaxed with jazzy music playing in the background. I love how I was able to have a conversation without sitting too close to other tables or talking over the music. The food is delicious! We have become so accustomed to large portion sizes that the meals seemed rather small but when the QUALITY of your meal is high, your experience is so much better. Not only was our meal excellent but the service was fabulous! Our waiter was very attentive and knowldegable.  Everything we had was so good and we left feeling very satisfied and full. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a quiet date night. Make sure you bring someone who can appreciate the food and atmosphere."

The menu offers a lot of unique dishes that make it stand out from the other brunch choices in Calgary. We came in a Tuesday morning and it wasn’t super busy but I’d recommend reservations for groups over 4 and during peak times. Note that it the restaurant is on the smaller side so it may not be able to accommodate large groups. We both ordered an iced hazelnut latte and west coast brunch bowl. They arrived quickly and we were very impressed with what we ordered. The service was great, very friendly and attentive. Overall we really enjoyed our experience at Namo. We’d loved to come back and try more menu items."

Isn’t too over priced and is extremely well portioned for the price you pay for it. Sometimes it’s so much I can’t even finish it! My go-to breakfast bowls are definitely the west coast and chicken karaage. Super flavourful and delicious with each bite you take. The employees are very attentive towards you too.

They have a lot of interesting menu items that I'd love to come back and try again!

This time I got a breakfast poutine on tater tots! Such a fun alternative potato choice to fries! I forgot the name of the dish but it had duck and it tasted great! I love that the sauces complemented the duck flavour rather than overshadow it."

It’s hard to decide what you want because their menu is extensive and everything sounds so yummy! Mid week is the best time to go if you’re not keen on waiting. We have never been disappointed. They’ve recently revamped their menu and it’s great!

Presentation was 10/10 and our server was nice. Should of opted for the lobster Benny as the mushroom one I got did not have a lot going on at all. Couldn’t really taste truffle. Just mushrooms very plain, would of been good with some more greens and what not. The Caesar could of used a bit more spice inside but that’s just preference I guess.
Overall would come back to try more.  Super cute spot"

Charbar,Argentine,"618 Confluence Way SE Calgary, AB T2G 0G1 Canada",AB,51.0479225,-114.0498306,2,"Came here with a larger group recently and honestly was very underwhelmed and disappointed with the whole experience. Our server Ivy was curt with us and not very friendly, only until after the manager checked in on our table she switched her attitude up. It wasn't even busy during our time here. It felt like she was quite inconvenienced when we asked questions about the menu (such as how many patties come with the gaucho burger, which is what I ordered). The burger itself was mid, and it looked like the patties were frozen and slightly warmed as there was no char or anything on them. All our burgers were like this and so not worth the ~$23 price tag. Really not living up to the name here. I wouldn't recommend dining here, take your business elsewhere where you can actually get a good burger and good service. Only upside was the patio view."

The price was a little outrageous for what you get. You'd think for that price they could add a potato option or fresh steamed veggies so it seemed a little one note. The hot crab dip was really great 😋 The brule desert was awesome too. It was dissappointing to sit in a chair that had long since lost it's cushion integrity and it felt like I was going to fall through, very uncomfortable, all the seats I felt were the same. Service was friendly and attentive. For the price it was a little lacking in quantity and comfort. Drinks were also not any different than the pub down the street, but twice the price."

The cheesecake was SO good. It is a smaller portion so we’d order two of these next time we go in.
The omelette with cheese topping was good but it was mostly the sourdough that made it so much better. The sourdough at this place is amazing.
Unfortunately the hot chocolate was cold but mocha was good.
The service we got here was top notch. We got seated fast and the servers here are so friendly and welcoming. We’d definitely go again when we are in Calgary next time."

We ordered seafood pancake (18$) and pork belly with corn cheese (38$). Seafood pancake was just onion, green onion, and flour didn’t taste any seafood. For the pork belly, it came out exactly like in the photo, the portions was not enough for 2 or 3 people as the menu recommended. The pork was bland, not seasoned or marinated as other Korean restaurants I went to. The side dish was a disappointment, only 3 side dish with very little portion for 2, compare to other Korean restaurants which has at least 4+ side dishes. We smelled like bbq after the meal because there was no hood fan at the restaurant."

Shibuya Izakaya,Japanese,"449 16 Avenue NE Calgary, AB T2E 1K3 Canada",AB,51.0665722,-114.0538765,5,"Was great coming here, really like the way they have their ordering set up, probably a carry-over from pandemic times, but you do so your ordering through your phone, each person does it individually, or you could always order as a group, you get the bill like normal in the end.

Service was great and the food came out pretty quick after you placed your order. Food tasted great and they were also very accommodating for one of the people in our party that has a gluten allergy.

Would definitely recommend coming here and we will be back again as well.

Only downside is that the restaurant shares parking with bubblemania and its always packed, had to park on the street/neighbourhood... So just make sure you're allowed to park where you do and don't get a ticket."
Shibuya Izakaya,Japanese,"449 16 Avenue NE Calgary, AB T2E 1K3 Canada",AB,51.0665722,-114.0538765,5,"This restaurant exceeded my expectations. I came here years ago and the restaurant needed a definite facelift. But it looks as though they did some renos. We ordered quite a bit of food: mango avocado rolls, shrimps, chicken rolls, mixed tempura's, all items had good flavor and presentation. Would highly recommend."

We were seated quickly, the servers were nice, and the food was amazing. It takes 45 minutes for the paella, which they instantly mentioned, but the wait is definitely worth it. Good food can't be rushed. 🤌 Also, being in the patio with a live band playing felt relaxing, and overall, this place had good vibes."

Beautiful patio set up. Mushroom dish is a must have! So good. Boiled octopus was delicious however very disappointed by the portion. 6 thin slice served over potato was super pricey.
Service could be improved. One server for all patio is not enough. She was very nice though.
We didn’t like sugar rim for tequila jalapeños drinks. Tequila and salt! Are married in heaven;)
Overall a great place."

We go to Spain and love it and this Spanish Food provider in Calgary is really legit. Food was delicious, service nice and a fun patio out front. Portions are small, need more Octopus for the cost associated but it is delicious. Also please give me more than 4 little churros for $10, they are delicious but portions need to be bigger.

Jalapeño cocktail really nice as well.

Definitely recommend."

Big Catch Sushi,Japanese,"8835 Macleod Trail SW Suite 130 Calgary, AB T2H 0M1 Canada",AB,50.9750938,-114.0735672,5,Southern Alberta has had the best sushi restaurant in western Canada for a while now. And it seems to have gotten better. Flawless sashimi. Perfect rolls. Stellar pressed sushi. Quite possibly the most underrated sushi bar this side of Japan. Always impressive.

However the food just never impresses me as it use to, sashimi is cut thin and tiny compared to what it once was. Pressed sushi and nigiri was meh, just seems like everything is more for ""show,"" nothing to write home about."

They present the food beautifully (great for those who like to take pictures), prices were in line with competitors, servers who pop up with simple eye contact and a nice cozy ambience.

Try the sushi made with snow crab, that was our favorite.

The restaurant is small so it is always a great idea to book a reservation."

Tacos Mexico,Mexican,"3725 Memorial Drive SE Calgary, AB T2A 4V6 Canada",AB,51.051855,-113.979544,4,"Good overall experience here. Unfortunately we asked for no cilantro on the tacos to which the server said he could put it on the side for us. We agreed to get it on the side but then he forgot to tell the kitchen  so we ended up with a bountiful amount on it. The server never noticed either or came to check up on us so we didn't end up telling him.
We enjoyed the sauces provided and found the coconut flan very tasty. We enjoyed all tacos but were disappointed by the flavour of their carnitas that day. I think they are definitely worth another try as it may have just been an off day."
Tacos Mexico,Mexican,"3725 Memorial Drive SE Calgary, AB T2A 4V6 Canada",AB,51.051855,-113.979544,5,"The authentic tacos at this restaurant are a true taste of Mexico.

Recommend their papaya salad and tom yam soup, and my favorite Thai milk tea!

The location is hard to find. It's in a Hotel, and service is not good. Feel like It doesn't matter if there are guests or not."

The entrance was not the easiest to find but once we did, the food was worth the adventure to get there. Service was fast and the portions were huge. I took my grandma and the mild wasn’t too spicy for her. I ordered medium spice and it was just perfect."
White Elephant Thai Cuisine,Thai,"1808 19 Street  NE Calgary, AB T2E 4Y3 Canada",AB,51.0684896,-114.0122319,1,"Not sure why so many people like this place so much, I think it's horrible! This was my second time trying it. I didn't like it that much the first time but didn't write a review. I decided to give it another try since so many people recommend it for ""good"" Thai food, and because I hadn't been there in years after the first time. Now I remember why I stayed away from it. I ordered chicken Pad Thai which I figured should be a ""safe"" dish at a Thai restaurant. It was disgusting! It looked bad and tasted even worse. It tasted like rice noodles drenched in ketchup. YUCK! I could only manage to choke down maybe five bites. Beyond the gross taste, it gave me a stomach ache. Even the thought of saving it and trying to eat some more the next day made me feel ill. I got this to go so I could bring it back and eat it in my office at work. So disappointed because I was hungry and I didn't want to waste it but I had to throw it out. The only reason I think some people might like it is because of the portion sizes (bc that's always something they mention when recommending it), but I'd rather pay that price for less food with better quality.
Also, they said they only take cash or debit. Turns out when I went to pay with debit my card wasn't working so she let me use my credit card and it worked...so it's not that their machines won't take credit cards...
As for the ambience of this place doesn't make me want to dine in. I've experienced better ambience in hole-in-the-wall huts in Thailand.
I won't ever be back to this place and I would never recommend this place to anyone I like!!"
White Elephant Thai Cuisine,Thai,"1808 19 Street  NE Calgary, AB T2E 4Y3 Canada",AB,51.0684896,-114.0122319,4,"The food here is really good value for the amount if you are coming with a large family.
The quality is questionable, I did not enjoy the meat textures for any of the beef and chicken. I haven’t tried the fish, so maybe that is better.
The flavours are decent and I really liked the fried tofu.
It’s quite spacious here, although service is a little slow. The atmosphere is not bad and even though the building is a tad old, it’s quite clean."
White Elephant Thai Cuisine,Thai,"1808 19 Street  NE Calgary, AB T2E 4Y3 Canada",AB,51.0684896,-114.0122319,1,"I was very disappointed with this restaurant.

Definitely the last time I will ever order from here again."
Anatolia,Turkish,"1235 26 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2G 1R7 Canada",AB,51.0301759,-114.0349756,4,"located inside crossroad market - I always end up coming back here as the flavours are wonderful and pricing vs value is reasonable for fresh authentic food. I would recommend the eggplant meal but those who love lamb shank must try that as well. The skewers are made fresh to order and can take some time. They work very efficiently here. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the Bali cake - although if you like simple and not a strong flavour/not too sweet, it may be perfect for you. Dishes (platters) go from $9-15 and there are plenty of good priced sides as well."
Anatolia,Turkish,"1235 26 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2G 1R7 Canada",AB,51.0301759,-114.0349756,5,"Lamb shank platter was so tender, I didn't need a knife! Absolutely everything was tasty. The beef borek was buttery and the best I ever had so far. Hot sauce was fresh and a generous portion. Fresh pide was so good, we ate the whole bag today too."
Anatolia,Turkish,"1235 26 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2G 1R7 Canada",AB,51.0301759,-114.0349756,5,"I’ve been wanting to try Anatolia for a while and finally made the trip down to Crossroads Market.

The lamb shank meal is $13.49, the price increased but it’s still a great price for such amazing food. This dish was everything I expected and more. Super flavourful sauce, delicious well-dressed salads, rice was perfectly cooked, and the tzatziki was amazing. The meat falls right off the bone. I was super impressed by the quality of food and the portion size. Fresh and delicious.

It’s a lovely family run booth - we saw people of all ages working and helping out in the kitchen. Super friendly staff. You can tell they have great food by how long the lines are. Well worth the wait."

Food is prepared with great care, and this is evident in the presentation and taste. Everything we’ve ordered is prepared fresh and lives up to the hype.

The breads, boreks and desserts are equally delightful. And there’s solid options for vegetarians as well (baked eggplant!)

Highly recommended and always looking forward to visiting again."
Selkirk Grille,Seafood,"1900 Heritage Drive SW Calgary, AB T2V 1R1 Canada",AB,50.982934,-114.1020811,3,"Had lunch here in the late afternoon after walking around the park. Staff were attentive and friendly.

We ordered
1. The ginger chicken rice
2. Steak Sandwich
3. Lobster wrap
4. Schnitzel sandwich

The ginger chicken rice was extremely wet, with the balsamic vinegar applied too generously. This made the dish much too sweet for my liking. The chicken and vegetables were fine.

Steak sandwich was almost well done although we asked for medium rare. Other than that it was perfectly edible.

The filling in the lobster wrap tasted almost like coleslaw, with little bits and pieces of lobster in scattered throughout the wrap.

The schnitzel in the schnitzel sandwich was extremely thin and underwhelming. When biting into the sandwich one can only taste the breading with little to no actual meat. The toasted bread is also extremely hard.

Food was edible, but overpriced."
Selkirk Grille,Seafood,"1900 Heritage Drive SW Calgary, AB T2V 1R1 Canada",AB,50.982934,-114.1020811,5,"Really enjoyed our meal at the Selkirk Grille.  We arrived at the perfect time to get happy hour and the dinner menu!

The NY steak was top notch. My wife didn’t enjoy the blue cheese bison burger as much but all other appetizers were amazing.

Incorporating service, kids menu, quality for dollars and decor this restaurant deserves this rating."
Selkirk Grille,Seafood,"1900 Heritage Drive SW Calgary, AB T2V 1R1 Canada",AB,50.982934,-114.1020811,5,"We held a work function at the Heritage Park, in Gasoline Alley. The Selkirk Grille catered the dinner and movie event.

Everyone loves the turkey dinner meal. It was displayed beautifully and had fantastic flavour. The dessert was an eggnog cheesecake (can you go wrong with that?!) - and people had seconds (who weren’t even dessert fans).

Grab the family and check it out!"
Selkirk Grille,Seafood,"1900 Heritage Drive SW Calgary, AB T2V 1R1 Canada",AB,50.982934,-114.1020811,1,"Went to heritage park today and on our way out we thought we'd stop by Selkirk for a quick bite to eat with our toddler. We were seated promptly, but after waiting 15+ minutes for service - after having asked within the first 2 minutes for the happy hour menu - we decided to leave. The restaurant was not busy and on our way out we stopped by the bar inside and commented to the 4 staff standing together chatting that we were leaving due to lack of service. Overall, a very unfortunate experience for us, we had thought this might be a nice place to go for a date night, but I'm not sure we'll give it another try"
Selkirk Grille,Seafood,"1900 Heritage Drive SW Calgary, AB T2V 1R1 Canada",AB,50.982934,-114.1020811,3,"Started off with the bannock and butter. I’ve had better bannock. Then I got their lobster roll. Extremely salty. Had to give it back as it was inedible. Got their chicken soup instead which was amazing! Loved it! We also got their chicken teriyaki on rice. Very basic. Not enough chicken. They gave us a complimentary dessert, which tasted okay. Sitting out on the patio was nice! The young girl serving us was so lovely. All other staff were very unfriendly. Glad I experienced this place once. Wouldn’t ever go back. Maybe I’d get their soup to-go 😅"
Thi Thi Vietnamese Subs,Vietnamese,"209 1 St SE Calgary, AB T2G 2G3 Canada",AB,51.0506829,-114.0604681,3,"I have come to Thi Thi from time to time over the years and their sandwiches are been tasty. The bread is soft & chewy on the inside while crunchy on the outside. On this occasion, we got the assorted cold cut, sate chicken, and super chicken & beef.

The meats are marinated well and quite tender, especially the beef. The spreads (including the pate) have a nice flavor which compliments the sandwiches.

The biggest complaint is that the amount of fillings in the sandwich are fairly scant. The layer of meat is as thin as can be and does not cover the entire bread surface on the inside. The assorted cold cut has maybe 2 kinds of cuts. This makes the bread to everything else ratio very high, especially compared to other places. Their sandwiches are also more expensive so overall, they do not feel as worth it.

Not a bad place to get a quick bite if in the area but would not be making this a regular stop."
Thi Thi Vietnamese Subs,Vietnamese,"209 1 St SE Calgary, AB T2G 2G3 Canada",AB,51.0506829,-114.0604681,5,"Was lucky enough that there was no line, the man beside me(who appears to be a regular) told me it normally takes 15 mins on waiting.
The owner is friendly and recommended the beef for first-time biters. But it’s spicy and I was not in the mood and thus chose sate chicken as the start. I followed the owner’s advice and ate it right away.
The portion is big! Bread is still warm and crispy 😋 Chicken is juicy and the veggies are fresh. They put slice cheese in it before toasting the bread, and it worked perfectly with the chicken!
The location is good, it’s the best lunch for a picnic!"
Thi Thi Vietnamese Subs,Vietnamese,"209 1 St SE Calgary, AB T2G 2G3 Canada",AB,51.0506829,-114.0604681,5,"It was definitely worth the wait! There are long lines, on any day. I can't even suggest a good time to go.

I was told to come at 10.30 when the store opens and as you can see it's crowded and mind you there are people behind me, as well.

YOU CAN PAY BY CARD, I carried cash due to some reviews but dw you can pay online. I had the Beef Sate and it was sooo YUM.

I can confirm this sub is the best viet sub in Calgary."
Thi Thi Vietnamese Subs,Vietnamese,"209 1 St SE Calgary, AB T2G 2G3 Canada",AB,51.0506829,-114.0604681,5,"An institution in Calgary - been coming here for Vietnamese subs since I was in high school in the 2000s. The quality hasn’t changed at all after all this time, which is a very good thing. It’s a hole in the wall and is takeout only, but you’ll be hard pressed to find a better banh mi in Calgary, especially at such a great price. Everything is fresh and the highlight is the sate beef. Family owned and operated, they recognize and greet all their loyal customers - this a true local business. Selfishly, I hope they continue to run the shop for many more years to come. A must visit if you’re looking for a tasty Vietnamese sub."

South Silk Road Chinese Restaurant,Chinese,"1130 10 Ave SW Calgary, AB T2R 0B6 Canada",AB,51.0442385,-114.0878506,5,"Best Chinese restaurant in Calgary. I have been in Canada for almost 10 years( I used to live in Maritimes). This is my first time to have authentic Chinese food like this level. Not only was it so authentic, it is also very tasty. It is even better than some of Chinese food I had in China.

There is a stereotype about Chinese food in the west that it is all about chowmein and dimsum. What North Americans don't understand that China is such a big country. Food from different province are so different. I'm from Hu nan province originally. I love spicy food. Never had authentic and good spicy food in Canada except this restaurant. I still can't get over the fact that I had authentic Chinese food like this in Canada not in China. Hands down the best and authentic Chinese restaurant in Calgary"

The ordered meat dishes were juicy and flavorful, and with each bite, the satisfaction increased. The Mapo Tofu had the perfect balance of spiciness and a tantalizing taste, making it an excellent complement to the rice. The dishes were not only fulfilling, satisfying my appetite, but also pleased my taste buds. Additionally, enjoying a cold beer alongside them helped alleviate the tiredness of the evening. The authentic cuisine and friendly atmosphere made it a wonderful place that I would love to revisit."

Amazing flavors with just the right amount of spice, but I love spicy food.  I would say the spice level is tolerable for most people.  The fish in chili oil soup is an amazing dish.  We also had the Kung Pao Chicken and Fried Green Beans in Black Bean Sauce.  I have had these dishes at many restaurants, but South Silk Road does them the best.  I think this is my new favorite restaurant!"

Service was friendly and waitress let us know that food may take longer because staff were on lunch break. They were kind and gave us dumplings on the house (thank you). When food was served, i was very surprised at the big portion size. It reminded me of korean seafood noodles i use to eat back in university days. The noddles were chewy and delicious. In the soup, they add ample of ingredient (variety of vegetables and meat), and you can tell, they put a lot of love and care into making the food. I tried the broth of all the different noodles my family got, every single one was different, but tasty. Service was attentive throughout, they refilled water, gave us more pickled radish and asked how the meal was.

I have only 2 complaints....
1. Why did i just discover this place after all this time!!!  (I would rate this the top 5 restaurants I've been in this past year, and that includes places i went to overseas)
2. The location is a little out of the way from my house :(

I look forward to coming back in the future :D"

The name is unique the owner been to China and decide to do fusion of traditional northern Chinese cuisine with Korean cuisine. The sweet and sour pork is must order. Very crispy and perfectly fried. The sauce is amazing as well. Recommend the black bean noodles little sweet and very yummy too I easily finish the bowl. It's like home restaurant vibe very warmth atmosphere and feel local.

Ogam Chicken,Korean,"6008 Macleod Trail S Suite 108 Calgary, AB T2H 0K1 Canada",AB,50.9995331,-114.070581,5,"I've had chicken from Ogam many times across years and consistently, I'm always happy with the quality of my meals. The fries are actually very flavourful and fresh. The chicken flavouring is balanced. I usually try to order something different each time so I can gradually get through their entire menu. In the photo below are the soy garlic bites and the cheese mayo fries! They make a great sharing snack, too!"
Ogam Chicken,Korean,"6008 Macleod Trail S Suite 108 Calgary, AB T2H 0K1 Canada",AB,50.9995331,-114.070581,5,The food was delicious(creamy garlic chicken is a must) and good portion. The staff are nice. One of the best korean resto in town. *Need to present Covid vaccine passport together with ID for dine-in.*
Ogam Chicken,Korean,"6008 Macleod Trail S Suite 108 Calgary, AB T2H 0K1 Canada",AB,50.9995331,-114.070581,5,"I ordered hot soy garlic chicken bites with cheese fries ($15.99 without a drink), as well as traditional (🌶️🌶️🌶️ as indicated by the menu) tteokbokki ($10) with extra cheese (+$3).

The main dish was very filling. Although I find Ogam prices to be on the higher end of Korean chicken in Calgary, they always have good quality food that doesn’t disappoint and makes it worthwhile. The chicken is crispy and rich in flavour. The hot soy garlic is great for someone looking for spicy, but not to the point that it overwhelms the taste.

For $13, the tteokbokki and extra cheese were served in a large portion. We could have split it with 3 people. I would definitely recommend the traditionally hot version, but for people who can’t do really spicy, there’s a rose (mildly spicy) version as well.

There are quite a few tables, but I can imagine that it would be very tight at busy times. The staff are very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is comfortable place for friend gatherings as they offer Soju as well."
Ogam Chicken,Korean,"6008 Macleod Trail S Suite 108 Calgary, AB T2H 0K1 Canada",AB,50.9995331,-114.070581,5,"Well rounded meal. Ordered the bul go gi outstanding ! Fast service.I’ll say it again - I loved the food outstanding. Ambiance sure isn’t spectacular but the authentic food makes up for this.  Lots of young ppl & young couples eating here was easy on my wallet. Beef Marinade was so delicious. (Never tried they’re chicken)

Lovely little salad it was so good I ordered another full one tremendous 🥗 dressing delicious flavour . I asked for medium spice & I got it 10/10."
Ogam Chicken,Korean,"6008 Macleod Trail S Suite 108 Calgary, AB T2H 0K1 Canada",AB,50.9995331,-114.070581,4,"The chicken was perfectly fried crispy and the creamy garlic sauce made it more tasty.

The bibimbap though needs a bit more meat for me and a sunny side up instead of the egg yolk only."

Broth is scrumptious. Plenty of options. Everything from noodle choices, spice/ heat options and toppings. I had the tonkotsu with a level 10 of heat and it was just what I needed in this -25c weather! Can’t wait to come back on my next trip!"

Their broth was fresh and tasty. I enjoyed my Tonkotsu black ramen, it had a great flavour and the texture of the noodles were just right. Their chicken Karaage was pretty good too. If you visit during lunch time on a weekday, you can pay just a little extra to upgrade your ramen to a combo which includes a small size rice bowl with Cha Siu."
Ramen Ichinen,Ramen,"349-3132 26 Street NE Calgary, AB T1Y 6Z1 Canada",AB,51.0798006,-113.9967287,3,"I've wanted to try this place since hearing about it some time ago, and was disappointed when we came by twice to find them closed. We finally had lunch here a while ago.

Service is ok, communication could be better. He wanted extra charshu, egg, and noodles with his tonkotsu ramen. I only asked for one extra piece of charshu (it only comes with one piece) for my tonkotsu black ramen, but they ended up giving and charging me for extra egg as well.

The broth was a little on the salty side and wasn't as flavourful as others places I've been to. The garlic oil was also a bit thick - I wouldn't order it again. The gyozas were nicely pan-fried and the flavour was ok.

I was honestly expecting more, with the way people spoke about this restaurant. If we're ever back, I'll try their regular tonkotsu ramen and hope it's better."
Ramen Ichinen,Ramen,"349-3132 26 Street NE Calgary, AB T1Y 6Z1 Canada",AB,51.0798006,-113.9967287,5,"Ramen Ichinen is a true hidden gem in Calgary.

Located in an unassuming strip mall in northeast Calgary, one would never expect this amazing little ramen hot spot to be here, however it has earned quite the reputation for providing delicious food in a comfortable, welcoming setting.

Each time we come here, it is always busy - usually with a bit of a wait - so plan in advance.

The staff is so incredibly warm, welcoming and attentive; they are always  happy to provide recommendations or explain menu items.

As for the food - it is absolutely incredible. The dimension of flavour in the broth (both the pork-based and the vegan yam-based options) is  outstanding, and always keeps us coming back for more. The homemade noodles (thick, thin and kale option) are always so fresh and perfectly al dente.

Each ramen comes with a generous smear of spicy miso paste on the inside of the bowl so you can customize the spice to your liking. A list of spicier chili options are also available.

While there is a decent portion of toppings included within the set price, there is also a wide variety of additional toppings to choose from for an additional small charge. We love adding the egg - it is so flavourful and tender with a unique yolk, obtained from the stewing process.

The menu is very broad, with options for every taste. From the appetizer menu, the chicken karaage is delicious and moist, and you can choose to substitute it for the standard pork if you wish.

If you are looking for your new favourite ramen spot in Calgary, look no further than Ramen Ichinen!"
The Coup,Vegetarian,"924 17th Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2T 0A2 Canada",AB,51.038019,-114.0832001,5,This one is a must try! We went here based on the recommendation of our Airbnb Host and thanks to her discovered this gem. The food is bursting with flavor and the staff is super friendly. This one has been added to our Top 10 in Calgary
The Coup,Vegetarian,"924 17th Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2T 0A2 Canada",AB,51.038019,-114.0832001,4,"READ YOUR RECEIPT BEFORE PAYING!! Our son and his girlfriend who are vegetarians came down for a visit from Vancouver.  We wanted to treat them to a nice lunch and with us being meat eaters, we started searching for reviews/ recommendations for a vegetarian restaurant.  The two best options were The Coup and 10 Foot Henry. We decided on The Coup and I can tell you the food was really good.  It was very flavourful and we did not miss the meat at all. What fell through is the service and the restaurant policy.  It took over an hour to get our food, the waitress missed ordering one of our order, and we never got a take out box that we asked for. Then it was time to pay the bill.  The waitress brought our bill and the debit machine with the tip function open ready to be entered, she then proceeded to leave it on the table, did not say anything and left.  When I went to put my card on the debit machine and ready to press the tip button I just happened to glanced at our receipt and noticed that 18% tip was automatically added to our bill already! We are a party of 5 , on their menu it says party of 6 or more will have tips added automatically. At other restaurants, the waitress would have let us know that the tip is already on our bill and to let us know to skip the tip screen, unfortunately this waitress did not say anything so if I hadn’t looked at the bill and I was not expecting automatic tip, I would have given her twice the tip amount. This is just a little shady and not transparent.  If this was not done on purpose then I would suggest re training your servers but then as I went back and read more reviews , I noticed other people have had the same experience so.. 🤔

UPDATE:

The management has reached out and apologized for our experience.  He has explained that the staff will be retrained and that there was a miscommunication with the staff and that he didnt realize that the debit machine was not set properly to not add auto tip unless it’s a party of six or more. Thank you for reaching out and for caring."

The Coup,Vegetarian,"924 17th Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2T 0A2 Canada",AB,51.038019,-114.0832001,2,"The only thing they make well is eggplants. Get any eggplant dish including eggplant sushi, you will not be disappointed. The pineapple rice was moderate.
We also got pad thai and hotpot. They lacked so much flavor. The service was sub par. Unfortunately I will not be recommending this place to anyone."

Cleaver,Modern European,"524 17 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2S 0A9 Canada",AB,51.0380697,-114.0728779,1,"This is how you lose a client over 2 warm beer.
On a hot day trying to get a couple of cold beer, we stopped to get them and we ended up getting 2 of them. However, they were warm. We asked our lovely server who has served us at least 3-4 times before and has been great to replace them with a couple of cold beer or 2 cocktails. She mentioned she would ask the manager. A couple of minutes later, she comes back saying they served them cold and all the draft beer was the same temperature. They could not exchange them.
We asked for some ice and the bill. The ice looked dirty. Once they knew we were reviewing them and told then this was a bad way to lose a regular customer over this and that we were reviewing them. Only then, the manager approached our table trying to fix the bad moment they already caused."
Cleaver,Modern European,"524 17 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2S 0A9 Canada",AB,51.0380697,-114.0728779,4,"Great little place. The cocktails were 5 stars - amazing variety and so good! The food was good, but not great. We had the steak salad and a bunch of different sliders. The cheeseburger slider was actually really great, but the rest of the sliders we tried were a bit bland (but they looked amazing!). Service was solid. I’ll go back but probably just for drinks."
Cleaver,Modern European,"524 17 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2S 0A9 Canada",AB,51.0380697,-114.0728779,2,"Lovely ambience but food wasn’t great. Had a strawberry mojito that did not taste as sweet as I’d liked…the salt and pepper calamari’s were okay, could have used a little less salt and more spices. The food portions were small and the popcorn tasted horrible, not sure what was used to season it but glad she took it away when our meals arrived. Not a place I’d come to again but maybe trying the popular sliders next time might change my mind."
Cleaver,Modern European,"524 17 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2S 0A9 Canada",AB,51.0380697,-114.0728779,4,"Went here today for my wife and my anniversary for something a little different. The food and service were excellent. They have a really wide selection of unique cocktails if that’s your interest and a decent selection of draft beer including local craft selections.

We made a reservation for 4:45 and we were seated and given the option of sparkling or still water. However they charge for their water regardless of choice. It’s only $2.00 but it’s still an odd thing to charge your customers for. They also give you a complimentary serving of popcorn.
The food was excellent! The truffle and Parmesan fries are awesome and I don’t think you can go wrong with any of the sliders including the soft shell crab.

If you do make a reservation be aware that you are given a time limit if your table has a reservation made on it for a later time and may be advised that you will have to finish up and leave before that time. We weren’t given an option of moving tables; something I found odd as we would have loved to stay to try one of the many cocktails as an after dinner treat.
Would recommend if you’re looking for something unique and different!"

Get the protestant cocktail if you like something on the sweeter side (it's made with cotton candy and tastes like a cake!)

The happy hour food deals are also great, but I always get the macaroni when I come here. A bit pricey at $15 but it is so rich and filling, I'd say it's worth it!"

Our Daily Brett Market & Cafe,Grocery,"1507 29 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2T 1M4 Canada",AB,51.0274522,-114.0954945,3,"The dish I got is meant to be eaten with bread. It’s essentially a dip with eggs. They only gave me two HALF pieces of bread. Obviously that’s not enough; and they know this. Of course we had to ask for more bread and they charged $2 PER PIECE. Bread is literally the cheapest food to make…. Even if it’s sourdough. Stingy.

They do it on purpose, why is it so hard to offer complimentary bread? At least just for that dish. They know people will need more bread and they charge extra for it. Honestly this really bothered me, all they care about is profit profit profit. How about better customer service?
I would’ve given it less stars but it did taste really good, I can’t lie."

Did not disappoint, great service, friendly staff and the chicken was 5-star worthy! Nice and moist, tender and freshly made. The smell when we went in was awesome, flavors were great, nice and crunchy. It's been a long time since I've had decent gravy like that. Even the almond cookie was moist and delicious!

The chicken bites were definitely crispy and stayed that way very long but the flavor is completely absent. It smelled so good but it really didn't deliver. The sour cream nuggets blew my palate out. Disappointing experience. The prices are quite a lot higher compared to other fried chicken spots as well."

As other reviewers have mentioned, parking is a bit of a challenge. Only two spots out front of the restaurant. We ended up parking in the paid lot on 16th.

The restaurant is small. Nothing more than a counter and a very small bar-type sitting area. We were lucky to snag the seating area as we wanted to eat our chicken hot and fresh. Staff were friendly and helpful.

Ordered the Lil Clucker sandwich, Motha Clucker sandwich, a four piece of fried chicken, Good Bites for the kids and an order of fries to share. The kids really enjoyed the all dark meat Good Bites. Big meaty portions and nice and crispy. My husband and I on the other hand found the chicken in our sandwiches to be very bland, definitely lacking any sort of salt, and a bit over cooked. The chicken pieces were the same.

Price point, Cluck N Cleaver is not cheap. For the 4 of us it was close to $80, which I felt was overpriced for the value and quality. I don’t think we’ll be returning any time soon, more disappointed than anything else."

I recently visited this restaurant and was blown away by their delicious Jjolmyeon. The dish was a perfect combination of chewy, spicy and tangy flavors, and the noodles were cooked to perfection.

SSO Yummy is definitely a must-visit for all Korean food enthusiasts. The restaurant is located in the heart of Chinatown and has a cozy ambiance that makes for a great dining experience. The service is also fantastic, and the staff are very friendly and accommodating.

We were looking for a Chilean food place with great enthusiasm, but when we arrived we noticed that it seemed more like store of boxes  than a place to sit down to eat. Pretty messy.
Also the person who served us leaves a lot to be desired, like she was angry that we were there, so even though the food was delicious, it was a bad experience overall.
Definitely a take out place."

Hdmona Restaurant,Ethiopian,"2881 17 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2A 0P7 Canada",AB,51.037392,-113.9920952,1,"**BEWARE**
Went looking for ethiopian food as my favourite restaurant seems to have closed down, and selected this place based on reviews, which is why I felt compelled to leave one myself.
The vibe is actually kind of neat, tiki style bar and pool tables, but the service was bad, the food was bad, and we were scammed by the staff and left with no option but to pay.

We ordered kitfo from the menu (ground beef dish,) and I asked if they had dorowat (chicken drumstick dish,) and she said no, but recommended another chicken drumstick dish.  I ordered a coffee to start, (it came after the meal, more on that later,) and we asked for water to drink.  We were served two room temperature bottles of water, and when our food came, it was the complete wrong food.  It was Tibs and Chacha. No chicken, and not ground beef.  I asked if this was the kitfo and chicken we ordered and she said ""not today"" and walked away, not to return for 40+ minutes with my coffee.

The food was pretty bland, tasted of mild spices and extremely dry meat.  One dish was laden with knuckle bone, and bone fragments.  The coffee was served over 20 minutes after we were done eating, and it has yellow fishing line bunched up in the end.  I asked about it, and she stold me I was to keep the plastic string it in to act as a filter, but still ended up with a cup full of coffee grounds.  gross.

When the bill came, we were grossly overcharged.  The meals were on the menu at $17 each, and the coffee was $5, but we were blown away to see the bill: The meals were $25 each, the coffee was $20, and our waters were $6.  for two waters.  I asked why the prices were so off, and she said ""meat cost is high today.""  I told her it was not alright, and that the menu said different prices, and she wouldn't have it, left us with no option but to pay almost double what the bill should have been,  Beware."
Hdmona Restaurant,Ethiopian,"2881 17 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2A 0P7 Canada",AB,51.037392,-113.9920952,2,The service here is SUPER slow. We had to wait almost an hour to get our order. There were 2 other customers waiting for quite a while ahead of us too. The food is okay but nothing to write home about. I don’t think we’ll come back because almost an hour wait is kind of ridiculous

I also really enjoyed my brunch dish, the duck and pierogies! The little pierogies are so cute 🥹! So flavourful and so filling. It does feel like you're eating a work of art. I also got a green tea and it's cute how you get a small teapot of hot water filled with just enough water for your mug. The green tea they had also tasted good."

OEB Breakfast,Breakfast & Brunch,"4132 University Avenue NW Calgary, AB T3B 6K3 Canada",AB,51.0780833,-114.1470575,3,"Came here for brunch around 1030 on a Saturday. Our server was pleasant but not very attentive. It took her probably 20 minutes to come and take our food order and she never refilled our water glasses. When we asked for our bill, that's when we got a refill. My other complaint is that the Perogies and Duck dish, which I usually LOVE, was rather bland. The perogies are usually very flavourful and this time around it tasted like something was missing. The duck was cooked well, but considering the main part of the dish was the perogies, it was just disappointing. Maybe it's this location, because I've been to the ones in Mission and Bridgeland and never had any issues."

Our server was friendly, gave great recommendations, and was so easy-going dealing with a 14 month old. I had the croque madame and I cannot wait to go back and have it again!

The outdoor seating was a bit more packed than my liking. Tables are placed very close together.  Food is great in general. Service is lovely. Having dinner outdoor in a park setting is very relaxing.  Just the noise level is a bit loud, it is hard to carry a low volume conversation."
River Café,Canadian (New),"25 Prince's Island Park Calgary, AB T2P 0R1 Canada",AB,51.0556,-114.0702533,4,"The food and atmosphere was amazing. The vibe is perfect to be a riverside Cafe. Ordered the Fish and Game board, and the smoked salmon is to die for. I would highly recommend the 'Smoked Salmon Tartelette' as a main. It was delicious, creamy, and came with a salad and mid boiled egg. The portion size for this was perfect. I will definitely be back again.
The only problem is they were very slow. Even the customer beside us got frustrated. It is wedding season and a lot of people are coming in large groups. So I'm hoping it was just a fluke."
River Café,Canadian (New),"25 Prince's Island Park Calgary, AB T2P 0R1 Canada",AB,51.0556,-114.0702533,5,Went here for Mother’s Day and I must say the food was very delicious.The restaurant was understandably busy but the staff was very friendly and apologized profusely. They kept on asking if we needed anything and made sure it was a pleasant dining experience. I can see why River Cafe was just ranked one of the top restaurants in the country and wholeheartedly recommend.
River Café,Canadian (New),"25 Prince's Island Park Calgary, AB T2P 0R1 Canada",AB,51.0556,-114.0702533,4,"It was a friend visiting from Britain that found River Café online and wanted to try it out.  We must have expected too much from the restaurant based on the good reviews we read before visiting... Of the four meals we ordered, the duck bread was a near disaster. Unfortunately, that was the one the lady that suggested the restaurant had. We complained about this experience (plus another hitch I don't feel like mentioning here). We got a teensy weeny discount off the duck bread plus an apology.

Overall, the restaurant is great but it's important to keep ones expectation for it moderate and make informed orders."

We went to River Cafe for brunch, and it was everything we wished for. The service was friendly yet professional and the dishes were served in a logical order. We first got our coffee, then the pastry trio, and finally the mains. Everything tasted as good as they were diligently presented.

We were also pleasantly surprised by the quality of the coffee (they used Monogram Coffee, a local roaster) and the fresh butter and blackberry jam that came with the pastry. We will definitely come back."

He did an excellent job being our server ❤️ It was Wednesday 17,2022. And had a reservation for around 4:20pm I think. I know we were the only one inside being served at that time. Since it was empty at that time of the day.  Sad I don’t remember the servers name but he was an an older man with  longer hair. Thank you for the service!!!!! Food was amazing I love pasta 🥰🥰🥰🥰 garlic grab was amazing I’m an island girl🇦🇬 so seafood is a green light for me there’s no limit when it comes to that and this beautiful place has it🥰"

It was hopping! The music, atmosphere, aromas and of course the decor was a teleport in time back to traditional Italy! We were quickly served and given hot buns and butter. We settled on Linguine Pescatore (Penne instead) and Risotto Fruitte Di Mare - which was pasta with seafood and rice with seafood. The Risotto was too big to eat so 1/2 went home for lunch;) What can I say about the food! Mamma mia è italiano (Mama Mia thats Italian). It sure brings me back to my Sicilian roots. Our handsome waiter was VERY diligent on constantly filling our water glasses and kudos to him as he held down about 8 tables simultaneously. Unfortunately, we dug into the food too quickly for a picture, however, I included many of the decor (as I asked permission to film and the management was gracious enough to comply as long as no people were in the pictures.) Parking is plentiful on 17th Avenue depending when you arrive. There is also some paid parking in the back corner of 8th street. Buon Giorno Ristorante Italiano was one of the best culinary experiences I have had in a very long time. My only issue was that the food took a bit long to arrive, however, it was very busy, we were given plenty of rolls and it allowed for more conversation. I am upgrading my 4 star review to 5 stars. Let's hope it will always be a top notch experience:) Buon appetito!"

The lamb tortellini was nice.
The scallop pasta was overcooked
the seafood risotto was ok, not the best I had
The Portofino scallopini wrapped shrimp was very good.
The chocolate ice cream dessert was amazing.
The tiramisu, creme brulee, and creme caramel were fine but didn't wow me.
To be fair I'm a chocolate person."

The beansprout soup had the right amount of saltiness, and anchovy flavor. I ordered the tofu soup without meat (vegetarian) and it was super delicious. The waitress was very attentive and the service was great overall. The wait was reasonable for four people (Tuesday evening), around 25-35min wait."

Han Corea,Korean,"7008 Farrell Road SE Calgary, AB T2H 0T2 Canada",AB,50.9924475,-114.0599611,4,"My work colleague decided for a random dinner plan. This place was suggested by one of the coworkers to us. Not so sure what to try we still thought to take a chance and went to this place without giving a second thought. It was surprising for me that this place has a very small dine in setup. We were lucky enough that we got the seats as after us people were in waiting for a while.

We ordered Seafood Pancake, Spicy Chicken and Jjukkumi Cheolpan Bokkeum Large serving with rice, sides and soup. We requested the main course first as it takes time for it to be cooked as it’s done on the table by yourself. It was a completely different experience for us. The food was cooking and so we all were waiting and chit chatting. I would say definitely the wait was worth it. The food tasted scrumptious. Kimchi was delicious. Unlimited refills were there for the sides.

Seafood pancake tasted good, Spicy Chicken was really good and Jjukkumi Cheolpan Bokkeum was the star of the day. It was so delicious. We finished everything though we all were feeling so full as the food tasted so good, no one could stop eating.

This place is highly recommended to go with family and friends who love seafood or wants to try something from there cuisine. Overall an excellent experience."
Han Corea,Korean,"7008 Farrell Road SE Calgary, AB T2H 0T2 Canada",AB,50.9924475,-114.0599611,4,"Very authentic Korean food. The wait can get long but they also recommended going to Busan, saying the menu was the same. But we were willing to wait 45 mins to get in.
Food was very good but we probably got unlucky since they made a mistake and gave us the wrong food. And another table beside us also had the same issue. But the owner/manager was very nice and quickly corrected amy problem"

AAA beef only five super thin pieces...
And chicken is also just like 5 to 6 small pieces.
Other than that, soup base was alright, veggies were just Okay.
For some people who workout quite often, it's definitely gotta have some protein insufficiency. However, the mild spicy soup base smelled as good as it tasted.
Clean environment and fast service.

Btw, the photo was the shrimp head. I felt like he's telling me that he's been through such a tough time to be caught here and being eaten by me was such a memorable moment."

The menu is super easy to read you just go through the steps you pick what size I would recommend the large comes with a lot of veggies and two plates of meat. Also, there is a section where you can make your own sauces and it’s always stuff up and the veggies there are fresh and the condiments are too.

Also, when you’re making your broth, it boils very quickly the burners they use are super strong.

I love that it’s not unlimited hotspot. There’s no pressure to keep eating and everything in my combo was super fresh and delicious."

Great portion and worth the price (only $21++ for the large size)
Free choice of sauces and there are some good on-side dishes needed to be tried 🔥

It was a chaotically busy evening on Stephen Avenue, but walking into the restaurant, we were instantly put at ease by the quiet and calming atmosphere. The service was fantastic right from the very beginning, with Christina proving to be very knowledgeable about the menu, the wine list, and helping us with my wife's dietary restrictions (Celiac and corn).

We started with the scallops, the grilled squid, and the smoked duck breast. All of which were excellent. However, it was a tie between the squid and the duck for our favorite.

The mains we ordered were, crispy sirloin pork, crispy skin coho salmon and the black Angus strip loin. Once again, everything was delicious and looked beautiful.

Christina's wine suggestions were very good as well.

We will be back as this is now one of our favorites!"

Greeted by Emily and Christina it was great service right off the hop. Both very nice and friendly faces. Constantly checking in on us to ensure everything was ok.

All the food was amazing. When we received our Candied Pork Belly app, head chef Jamie brought it out and had a quick chat. Also another splendid individual.

Will 100% revisit this place. Pricing was very reasonable."

Service was most excellent and food was great but with a couple notable miss steps.

The flavors really were spot on for all the dishes and the presentation was superb.  Roast carrots were rather undercooked and the standard menu burger was a bit to crispy/blackened on the outside which created a strange flavor contrast.

If it wasn’t for those execution challenges the meal would have been near perfect.

For example. The market fish was a skin on salmon that was beyond perfect. Crispy on the outside and flawless on the inside."
Klein Harris,Desserts,"110 8 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2P 1B3 Canada",AB,51.0458296,-114.063681,5,Everything was very good but not as memorable as I hoped. Another good quality restaurant that may have been very strong many years ago but the competition has caught up in creativity.

Very knowledgeable about the dinner and drink menus in fact I followed her recommendations for both my drink (mescal margarita) and main course (Thai green curry) selections. Both were *spot on* I would return repeatedly for the Thai Green Curry itself, so flavourful and delicious 💜 and the mescal margarita….if only it came by the jug!

For drinks we got the bellini and el camino margarita, both were very fruity and refreshing. Like the bellini the best. For foods, we got chicken pesto quesadilla and the cajun chicken sandwich. Very flavorful chicken sandwich. The chicken pesto quesadilla had the right amount of cheese and meat that was very tender. The dipping sauce that came with it was so good, it's like drugs. For the table, we got yam fries and truffle fries. Yam fries we very sweet and crunchy, while truffle fries was more savory. Both hit the spot for appetizers. Service was also very fast and attentive. Overall pretty good experience, would come back"

I was there with 3 other people and as soon as you walked in you get hit with a greasy dense smell. The inside is really crammed with a bathroom door that opens right into the seating area, which is really bizarre. I got enchiladas which was loaded with the beef which was nice but after the first bite there was barely any taste to it, the mashed beans were dry, and the rice was dry and wet at the same time, which was weird. One of us got quesadillas and asked for it to be extra crispy which came out to be extra soggy... 2 of us got fajitas and it was alright. The nachos, however, were very good and definitely worth the try.

The server was a young guy who was very friendly and attentive, probably the only positive part of the experience."

Reasonably priced for the portion size and everything was served fresh and delicious.  Two (minor) criticisms though. First, fries were a tab bit too salty.

Excellent and healthy ingredients that make you feel good after eating them, friendly staff, cool artwork (pictured), and even a ride with an elephant donning a cast iron saddle (also pictured)! Super cool independent place, which is of course par for the course in Inglewood!"

Can't say too much about the food except that I wish they would change it more often. I will have to say that the service was very great. The few people that took care of us were excellent.

Their menu is varied and everything is top-notch. I enjoyed the Butter Chicken with Nann and Basmati Rice and it was absolutely delicious. We have been to Browns Social in Vancouver and this was just as good if not better, you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. I also enjoyed a pint of their red ale which was just a perfect accompaniment to this meal."

Food is always fresh and tastes great! The nice thing is they usually have a spot available although they can get really busy on the weekends. They also have plenty room inside and a really nice patio outside. It's also a fun place to watch the hockey games.

The chicken in both entrees were incredibly deep fried and greasy. I had half the sandwich that was shared between my partner and myself. The remaining was left on the plate along with the basket of fries as I felt sick from the grease. Manager Trevor came to remove our plates and we explained the chicken itself was greasy. Trevor was remorseless, and proceeded to take the plates. Once requesting bill, I had expressed to the server the situation in which she took the complaint back to the manager. Manager offered to take off 10%. The point of the review is the manager himself did not acknowledge our initial concern. It was brought to my attention that he is about 5 months new and I firmly believe he is not fit to be a manager. We should have not needed to explain to the server after expressing to the manager after he himself seen that 75% of the meal was not consumed.

Our waitress was great, but we will not be back."
Dragon Dynasty Chinese Restaurant,Dim Sum,"200 -118 5 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2G 0E2 Canada",AB,51.0485923,-114.0618208,4,Went there for a latenight dinner and tried the  dimsum menu.  We found the shrimp toast was too oily. But was super tasty though.   The rest of the food came out with proper timing.   We weren't waiting. Flavors and quality were there. Because we were there on a Thursday evening.  The kitchen closes at 9pm. Other than that good place to eat
Dragon Dynasty Chinese Restaurant,Dim Sum,"200 -118 5 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2G 0E2 Canada",AB,51.0485923,-114.0618208,5,"It was Sunday nearing 2pm, and Silver Dragon Restaurant was one of the few restaurants that still served dim sum.

I loved the fact that even at such a late hour for dim sum, the staff still came by with trays or carts with dim sum. One of the attentive wait staff also came by to offer a menu to order whatever dim sum I did not see on passing by carts.

Food was absolutely delicious and I would come again!"
Dragon Dynasty Chinese Restaurant,Dim Sum,"200 -118 5 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2G 0E2 Canada",AB,51.0485923,-114.0618208,4,A decent dim sum restaurant! This is an old but well known Chinese restaurant in Chinatown with a large dining area and cart style dining when ordering dim sum. The servers come around with carts and differing selections of dim sum and you can pick which ones you’d like to order. The food is alright but can be bland at times and not very hot as they’ve been strolled around in their carts for some time. The waiters are quite attentive and friendly as they clean off your table from empty plates. The prices are a bit high but that’s too be expected nowadays at most dim sum spots. It can be quite busy during lunches on weekends but overall it’s big enough to accommodate everyone on most days. You can park along the streets nearby or at a paid parking lot. Remember downtown street parking is free on Sundays. Check this out if you’re in Chinatown and craving some dim sum!
Dragon Dynasty Chinese Restaurant,Dim Sum,"200 -118 5 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2G 0E2 Canada",AB,51.0485923,-114.0618208,5,"I went here because I heard the dimsum is very good and it was very good. There is now 3 top places for dimsum and this is in the top3. The servers were extremely nice even serving us the food and ongoing great service overall. The vibe of the restaurant reminded me of a really good dimsum place in Hong Kong and also in Vancouver. The food was asseptional. We had the Shumai, Har gow. Shrimp&scallop har gow, beef tripe, beef fried rice and a medium wonton noodle soup and it was very authentic and delicious. Definitely coming back for the courses! You got to eat dimsum with jasmine tea of course. This place is a 5/5* in all aspects."

As an Asian, I can say that Asian restaurants don’t have a reputation of being the best in the dining experience. However, this was best dim sum service I’ve had in a while and the presentation was beautiful! Two staff members saw that I was looking for my waitress and asked if I needed anything. Our waitress was so polite and quick to get us our orders! On top of that, the food was so delicious and their egg tarts were the best I have ever had! We left feeling very satisfied and happy!"
Po-ke,Japanese,"908A Centre Street NE Calgary, AB T2E 2P7 Canada",AB,51.060211,-114.0623163,3,"A mix of good and bad. Positive: it's possibly one of the best poke I had in a casual / fast food restaurant. I had a large build your own Poke Bowl. a good variety of proteins ( tuna, salmon, scallops, tofu, and more), mixers, toppings, and dry finishers. Good quality and quantity overall. Small place , nothing fancy, with an outdoor seating area. Reasonably priced. Negative: The restroom was filthy, which, in my opinion, is an indication of cleaning practices that could extend to the kitchen and handling of food. This is an opinion, not that I confirmed this was the case."
Po-ke,Japanese,"908A Centre Street NE Calgary, AB T2E 2P7 Canada",AB,51.060211,-114.0623163,4,"Po-ke has consistently been one of the best spots for poke bowls in Calgary over the years. Typically, we will get the Po-Ke special bowl and the hurricane bowl (marinated salmon, special scallop) on brown rice and am always pleased with how they make it.

The fish is fresh and you get a good amount of fixins (sometimes could use a bit more of some such as the corn but usually a good  serving). The flavors compliment each other pretty well and you can appreciate each individual component (I recommend a bite of pineapple, corn, seaweed salad, and marinated salmon on brown rice together). The bowls are pretty hearty (with the large hurricane bowl) so you'll be plenty full.

We also tried their Samurai dog and I wouldn't recommend it. It's a fairly thick bun and the hot dog felt like it was a Schneider's hot dog. The seaweed salad and seaweed is nice but did not make it worth $7."
Po-ke,Japanese,"908A Centre Street NE Calgary, AB T2E 2P7 Canada",AB,51.060211,-114.0623163,5,"We had the Po-ke bowl, the Traditional bowl and the Hula dog. The Po-ke bowl had nice flavours,  the traditional was a bit flat. Not busy at all for Saturday afternoon."
Po-ke,Japanese,"908A Centre Street NE Calgary, AB T2E 2P7 Canada",AB,51.060211,-114.0623163,4,"Visited Po-ke for the first time today. The food was fresh, tasty and hearty. The staff was very friendly and everything looked very clean. They also provided customer parking behind the building which made visiting much easier. I will certainly return to fix my next Poke craving.."
Po-ke,Japanese,"908A Centre Street NE Calgary, AB T2E 2P7 Canada",AB,51.060211,-114.0623163,3,"A solid 3.5 overall. It's a nice spot that hits the mark with a craving for poke. Pricing ranges from $10-18 (depending on size and also topping/type). Their Po-Ke special bowl was very unique and you get heavy flavours from the overall bowl (the mandarins actually are a good mix to it) I found that the saucing was too heavy on the bowl which overpowered many other toppings along with the sushi rice flavour. Quantity of toppings was ok (heavier on some toppings than others such as seaweed salad and mandarins vs avocado, fish). The musubi side was also ok - rice didn't stick together too well and was a little too salty for my liking.
Good cozy ambiance in this shop - well kept and clean. Service was ok - very straight to the point."

The curry flavor and cripsy taco were transformational, and I love it.
In terms of pricing, it is reasonable for a downtown location, but the portion is quite small."
Pure Modern Asian Kitchen + Bar,Pan Asian,"815 8 Avenue SW Suite 100 Calgary, AB T2P 3P2 Canada",AB,51.0459149,-114.0799105,4,"This is not your typical Vietnamese spot - it is definitely more upscale (which also means it’s a bit pricier) but you get what you pay for! Most of the food here is super delicious and there are a number of interesting fusion style dishes as well.

The pho broth here is one of the best I’ve have in the city - super rich and flavourful and the large size is huge!! We also got the chili lime wings which were super tasty and fried to perfection.

My husband ordered the Tom Yum Seafood linguine which I wasn’t super impressed by however the portion size was generous and the fried soft shell crab on top was a nice touch.

The service was ok - not the friendliest or most attentive staff but they get the job done.

Overall this is a great spot to check out if you’re looking for some creative Vietnamese inspired food!"
Pure Modern Asian Kitchen + Bar,Pan Asian,"815 8 Avenue SW Suite 100 Calgary, AB T2P 3P2 Canada",AB,51.0459149,-114.0799105,5,We have tried this place in several occasions and were pleased by the quality and originality of the food. The classical Vietnamese dishes are well reinvented. It is also a nice spot for chicken wings. We reconnected with their cuisine at the Taste of Calgary Festival. The sesame donuts with spicy chicken or pork are the perfect examples to showcase their new take on a classic street food bite.

Calcutta Cricket Club,Indian,"340 17 Avenue SW Calgary, AB T2S 0A8 Canada",AB,51.0380437,-114.0708573,3,"Food was extremely average and flavourless. This restaurant is mainly for non-south Asian people since the food was bland and white washed. Naans were not crispy and very doughy. Paneer was chewy and gravy was so sweet with no masala. Dal Makhani was decent. Condiments were not served with food. The vibe was really nice. They have outdoor seating too but cause of the rain it was closed. Servers were great too and were well informed about Indian dishes.
Recommended for the atmosphere, not the food."

I recently dined at this Greek restaurant and I have to say it was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm hospitality and a cozy atmosphere that made me feel right at home.

The food was out of this world! The flavors were so fresh and vibrant and each dish was prepared with great care and attention to detail. The lamb chops were cooked to perfection and the tzatziki sauce was the best I've ever tasted. And let's not forget about the baklava - it was simply divine!

The service was exceptional. The staff was attentive and friendly, and they went out of their way to ensure that every aspect of our meal was perfect. From the timing of each course to the recommendations on the menu, everything was spot-on.

Overall, I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. It truly exceeded all of my expectations and I cannot wait to go back again soon. If you are looking for an amazing Greek dining experience, this is the place to be!"

The wait was only 10 mins and we finally  got a table. The food is excellent and the quality is superior, the building is old but who cares the food is what matters. This restaurant should be a 5 star Michelin restaurant. The food comes out super hot, they have two menus one super authentic Chinese and the other western, we ordered from both. The crab was awesome so flavourful and spicy. My 2 year old doesn’t eat spicy but ate some crab and loved it but couldn’t handle the spice but tried to eat as much as he could .  Every dish was made with perfection. The staff was amazing and super easy to deal with. I would highly recommend this place for Chinese food. I can’t wait to eat here again!"

Alloy,Canadian (New),"220 42 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2G 1Y4 Canada",AB,51.0163225,-114.060178,5,"If I could give this place ten stars, I would! I can’t believe I’ve lived in Calgary for 15+ years and only just had the pleasure of dining at this Calgary culinary landmark.

Everything from the ambiance, decor, food and service was absolutely incredible.

My date and I started with the hummus and the pita bread was so pillowy soft inside with a nice crisp exterior— making it a perfect vessel for the perfectly seasoned velvety hummus.

Upon the recommendation of friends who have dined here previously, we had the gnocchi and short ribs. They were featuring a pork belly— it’s my absolute favourite protein, so had to have that also.

The gnocchi was THE BEST gnocchi I’ve ever had— each mouthful was an absolutely decadent dream on my palate— I’ve never had such delicious, pillowy morsels of perfection in my life, and I have eaten at some notable restaurants in NY, Toronto, and Vancouver. This gnocchi dish was absolutely divine!!

Next came the pork belly, which was a summer feature. I hope it becomes a permanent menu item! The pork belly was cooked to perfection and the dollops of black garlic sauce gave the dish a moorish umami flavour. The pickles emoji mushrooms were a nice touch— it cut through the richness of the dish and made it a perfectly balanced dish.

The short ribs did not disappoint—massive chunks of beefy perfection served with a velvety mash that eased the palate after tasting the robust flavours of the reduction. I am salivating as I type this review, by the way.

The wine list is vast and even though I can’t recall what we had, they made for perfect pairings with our meal.

Lastly, it’s nice to dine at a restaurant that has not lowered the standard of service after covid. Further to that note— there’s a reason why this gem of a restaurant has a loyal following. It’s a great date spot, has amazing food and impeccable service.

I can’t wait to dine here again!!!"
Alloy,Canadian (New),"220 42 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2G 1Y4 Canada",AB,51.0163225,-114.060178,5,"I was here over the weekend for a wedding, and everything about Alloy was absolutely perfect. The servers and bar staff were so friendly, were very accommodating to my dietary restrictions and had such a positive attitude all night.

The food was unreal. I got the goat cheese salad but I tried some of my friend’s truffle gnocchi… oh boy. So good. Can’t go wrong with either choices but if you like truffles and/or gnocchi, the choice is clear. The braised short rib was my main and it was so tender and delicious. We got each of the desserts to try (oreo cake, mango custard, passion cheesecake) and those were really really good too. My favourite was the cheesecake but I couldn’t taste too much of the passion fruit. The gelato with the oreo cake was delicious. The mango custard was our least favourite, but it’s still good! I think the chutney and cardamom threw us off a bit, especially having the other two right before hand.

Highly recommend Alloy, you really can’t go wrong with anything here!"
Alloy,Canadian (New),"220 42 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2G 1Y4 Canada",AB,51.0163225,-114.060178,4,"This is a hidden gem. Honestly very missable place and thought it was closed when I arrived.

Would still highly recommend as it was a good experience."

They give it to you on a stove so make sure you adjust the heat when your soup starts to boil or all your soup will evaporate 😂.

Everyone around us was Korean so that is a good sign for bringing in the authenticity. This is a bar restaurant, it has the volume and feel of a bar restaurant. The drinks are average priced and there are some food and drink combos - main dish + 1 soju you get a free deep-fried korean corndog.

Can't ask for much more - the service was great and food was made hot & fresh. There are no sides so don't expect any free kimchi. The pricing is moderate to high considering you need to pay for everything including rice. Definitely worth the try and it is a great option for late eats and drinks!"

Went with my husband today for brunch and it was awesome. Few improvement areas: we waited for 10 mins for our water (didn’t think it’ll take this long), we asked for vegetable spring roll but received meat spring rolls in our vermicelli. When we wanted to pay, no one served us until we asked after standing there for a while. I think staffing up during busy hours might help? Otherwise, great service."

Shijo Sushi,Sushi Bars,"1240 Kensington Road NW Unit 103 Calgary, AB T2N 3P7 Canada",AB,51.0527629,-114.0909431,5,Phenomenal sushi - we got the deluxe set and it was more than enough for 2. Great selection of rolls and they even let us modify the last 2 rolls for a speciality roll (for an additional charge). I couldn’t even decide which roll I liked the most because they were all so tasty and flavourful. Highly recommend for a cozy dinner out
Shijo Sushi,Sushi Bars,"1240 Kensington Road NW Unit 103 Calgary, AB T2N 3P7 Canada",AB,51.0527629,-114.0909431,4,"They had the best grilled squid I had in Calgary.
Presentation of food was good, but sushi overall tasted okay and didn’t stand out amongst other sushi restaurants. It’s a decent neighbourhood sushi restaurant."
Shijo Sushi,Sushi Bars,"1240 Kensington Road NW Unit 103 Calgary, AB T2N 3P7 Canada",AB,51.0527629,-114.0909431,5,"Japanese food at it's finest for sushi. And in a word - ""beautiful"".

Nuts and bolts - the food is delicious, affordable ($35ish + tip per person) and the location is easy to access in Kensington!

The ambiance is an extension of the food. Bizzare line, yet once you've dined at Shijo you'll experience what I am trying to poorly describe - I really ought to expand my vocabulary.

Ambiance:
From the onset the scent of a mild salt reminiscent of the ocean tickles you when you enter.

The lights are easy on the eyes, neither too dim nor bright and we exited Shijo we were not jarred by the sunshine. They found the goldilocks zone for lights for lunch anyways!

The chairs are comfortable for a range of sizes - I'm a larger chap and my wife is slender, we both felt relaxed in our seats, which is rare.

The decor and music maintains a respectful distance but is not muted. It's like a street performer maintaining a respectful distance and allows you to come to them. So, when we chose to focus on the music or decor you could lose yourself in the details and come back to conversation comfortably.

Food:
Finally, the food is an embodiment of all the aspects of the ambiance. From scent, to sight to feel of the food when you eat to being pleasing to the eyes. There is a subliminal element of beauty in the food from presentation to flavor.

We ate our fill of 3 sushi rolls and each bite was so complex and just beautiful to experience even as we grew sated.

If you've got a hankering for sushi, Shijo is the place to go."
Shijo Sushi,Sushi Bars,"1240 Kensington Road NW Unit 103 Calgary, AB T2N 3P7 Canada",AB,51.0527629,-114.0909431,5,"Always have the best time here! The sushi and rolls are beautifully plated and so tasty!
We tried their new menu items including the Sashimi Ceviche which was delicious!!

Will be back for more!
Thanks to Chef Sam for his beautiful food artwork"
Shijo Sushi,Sushi Bars,"1240 Kensington Road NW Unit 103 Calgary, AB T2N 3P7 Canada",AB,51.0527629,-114.0909431,5,"I still can't get over how good the sushi was last night. We ordered all three special rolls, in addition to the spicy salmon and tempura asparagus rolls. The specials were fairytale in autumn, unagi and dried bonito oshi (rectangular) and - our personal favorite - the Cajun styled seared tuna. Every single bite was so good and the last roll that we had was literally melt in your mouth delicious. There was even a debate at the end as to who would not get one last piece, that's how good it was. I would say that out of every sushi place I've been to in Calgary, from the most expensive to the least, this one is my absolute all-time favorite and I can't wait to go back. So good!!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

Service is quick and kind. The server even warned us that we may have ordered too much. Everything was freshly made and delicious. It wasn't too sweet or salty. I'd come here again if I ever return to Calgary."

Authentic Chinese cuisine 👍
Food was served hot and fresh 😋
Started with complimentary tea, and we ordered chicken and corn soup.
For our main dish, garlic soy chicken, breaded seafood, seafood fried rice, pepper beef, sweet and sour pork. With lemon iced tea for our drink.
Very satisfied 👍 👌"

I wanted to try pecking duck and lobster combo with my family and the price was around $400 for 6 people. With few drinks, total bill came out around $500 including tips. Food wise, pecking duck was good but when I requested more green onions and cucumber , they never came back. Other food.. was ok but not sure if its worth to pay almost 400 bucks…. I wouldn’t recommend ordering the pecking duck and lobster combo. Just order regular menu items then you will be ok."

The color isn’t right, the texture is firm (not falling off the bones easily). Most of the dish is layered by the firm (not soft) peanuts. Plus the price is considered premium for a person came from Toronto. $7.25 for that chicken feet is awful. The other dim sum was okay, not too impressive. Except for the congee, the congee is very good."

The Dishes we ordered were Great and Delicious.,  This place is not recommended if you’re a picky eater."

A group of 4 of us arrived today and were seated immediately. I ordered a cup of soup and asked for a bun to go with it. Soup was delicious (chicken) and bun was toasted - bonus! Beer was great - selection varies but for sure try the Tragically Hip lager 🍺
Mediterranean salad with grilled chicken and my friend said his wings were great. Server was the best - wrong type of wings came out and was quickly corrected. She was just so wonderful. Picked up some beer out the door in the gift shop - great place to spend an afternoon. Girl in the shop was excellent. Tonnes of free parking and easy access."
Big Rock Grill,Canadian (New),"5555 76 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2C 4L8 Canada",AB,50.984735,-113.955871,4,"This review is for Traylor Parker that opened on June 23rd, 2023.

We went on opening day at around 4pm and the place wasn't too busy. It's a beautiful restaurant in the brewery with lots of spacious outdoor and indoor seating. We had the fully loaded nachos with brisket. We would've liked a lot more nachos for $26.50, they were delicious though!

We also got the lone star platter as well. Hm actually didn't get any pickles but chalking that up to opening day roughness. I enjoyed the brisket but would have liked it to be more flavorful, juicy and tender. Ribs had excellent flavor but needs to be more juicy and tender.

Pulled pork is rarely my favorite but it was good, I would've liked it to be a bit more juicy. I liked the brown bbq sauce, it had great flavor depth. The red one wasn't as good, tasted more like it came out of the bottle. Loved the spicy fries. Potato salad needs more flavor, very bland. Beans were good!

We also had a lime cherry sour and a peach cider that was delicious. I have the Viennese lager but that wasn't anything special to me.

We'll be returning in a couple weeks to see how this restaurant settles in!"

I had the exceptional burger and she had the wings. Clean, friendly , nice atmosphere and of course, good food. Thanks, I'll be back."
Big Rock Grill,Canadian (New),"5555 76 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2C 4L8 Canada",AB,50.984735,-113.955871,5,"Is five stars enough? It might not be!

My wife grew up in the southern United States, and while we've tried a lot of barbecue here in Alberta, this is EASILY the best one (by a Texas mile!!) I was so excited to come here knowing I personally prefer Texas style barbecue over the more saucy southern styles.

We ordered the $75 LoneStar platter and banana cream pudding (not pictured) and had lots to take home after eating our fill.

The brisket was tender, juicy, melt in your mouth delicious (and yes, it passes the bend test). It's just amazing and easily the best in YYC.

The ribs were my wife's favorite on the platter! We like the flavor of them. They were tender without being mushy and had a nice bite to them.

The pulled pork on the white bread with a little sauce and slaw was just *chef's kiss*. The quality and smoke on all the meat is very easy to see and taste.

We need to talk about the sides! I feel like at most barbecue places, the sides are a throw on to make you feel like you got a ""platter.""  Not here! All family recipes passed down and served to you to enjoy! The beans were our favorite,  but all were delicious.

Finally, the banana cream pudding. My wife said she hasn't had PROPPER pudding for over 7 years now (last time she was home)... well, this is it, it was so amazing! She's sold on it, and we'll be back just for that (and honestly, everything else).

The staff were all so kind and accommodating as well. We really really enjoyed our visit and will absolutely be back again.

Thank you, Traylor Parker's we will most definitely be back!!"
Big Rock Grill,Canadian (New),"5555 76 Avenue SE Calgary, AB T2C 4L8 Canada",AB,50.984735,-113.955871,4,"Ordered the Ranch Hand Platter and loaded fries with brisket on a relatively slow day. The overall flavor and sauces are good. Meats, other than the brisket, were a little dry and that's disappointing. It's pricey here and all sides are extra. Their hours are limited so you need to plan ahead. Overall, it's a notch above average for BBQ in Calgary."

Wasn't aware there was soup on the menu as it wasn't shown on Skip - would have loved to order that too!"

I read the other reviews about the small little juice flies but I mean I didn’t see and they had fresh vegetables and mangoes and I love the taste.

Mahmoud (the owner) is a very kind hearted and genuine person. He is vey welcoming, hardworking, honest, and provides excellent customer service.

An example comes to mind; it happened last month, when I passed by his store (it was his day off) but he was at the store cleaning and preparing for the next business day. The ""Open"" sign was turned off but the door was open, so I walked in and ordered 2 sandwiches (I forgot it was his day off and assumed that he forgot to turn the sign on) while he was preparing my order, 2 more customers walked in and placed their orders.

He did our orders with a big smile and didn't even say that he was closed until we asked him why the ""Open"" sign was off.

Thank you Mahmoud for your great food, service and big heart!"

From coming to the restaurant till paying the bill, I was so amazed by the level of professionalism, even though it was busy around the time I arrived (19:30).

The servers were amazing wishing me happy birthday, making me feel extra special on my day, warming my heart completely, to the chef coming personally to deliver my main course to the table... this restaurant deserves more than 5 stars!!! I am truly amazed.

And to the amazing server, Kintan P, thank you SO SO much  for making my night feel special with your level of service and your can-do spirit. You truly are a rockstar!! ❤️🙌🏽

All in all, an amazing dinner for a very chill Birthday, and I can't wait to come back to this amazing restaurant. It definitely will be my go-to restaurant in downtown Calgary!"

I ate here for a few nights while on a business trip in November. Every item that I ordered from the menu arrived quickly and was delicious. The curry was actually a delightful surprise!
The venue can get quite busy and noisy at times, especially near the bar, but there are seats further away if you want a quiet space.
I wasn't disappointed on any visit, and being located inside the Sandman hotel makes it an easy choice at the end of a long day.
I will definitely be dining here again!
PS if they still have it on the menu, make sure to get a slice of the key lime pie for dessert, it's sublime."

I went with my cousin last month and we had a wonderful time. Not only was the food great as usual, but the service was amazing. Our server was Simone, and she is the sweetest person. We made great conversation, she constantly came to make sure we were enjoying everything, was super patient with any questions we had, and she even brought a dessert to congratulate me on graduating.

Since we're vegetarians, we got the tofu lettuce wraps and the tofu bowl, and both were delicious. The zen rolls and truffle fries for appetizers are also super good. They have an okay amount of vegetarian options, but otherwise there's a good variety and the portions are pretty good. The prices overall are fairly comparable with other restaurants, but the quality is there. The atmosphere is lively as it's right on Stephen's Ave, and I haven't had a bad experience here since I started coming."

Service was great, but perhaps a little disorganized. To their credit, we went during the height of Stampede and the place was packed - so truthfully no real complaints with the service. The food is always great. Tuna Poke bowl and the Feenie burger were superb, as was the ceviche and the crunchy prawn roll. This restaurant is always a good choice."

I found a hair in the basket of tempura as a picture. They made another one again for us with kindly apology which was good. But tempura was soggy and not crispy.
We also ordered Tonkotsu Ramen with Japanese Chashu pork but they brought with BBQ pork.
BBQ pork's flavour was too strong for Tonkotsu soup and I wasn't able to taste Tonkotau at all.
56°egg on ramen was horrible as my picture.
It was just sandy, not runny egg. I don't know how they made it...
Again, this restaurant is Chinese restaurant, not Japanese.
If the staff weren't friendly I would have given them only 1 star for sure."
Hana Sushi,Japanese,"1807 4 St SW Calgary, AB T2S 1W2 Canada",AB,51.036803,-114.0717295,2,"The quality of cleaning is not good, as you see in the pics. The cup is not well cleaned, the menu is not clean it is sticky.
The staff are good, not too friendly.
The quality of food is good but not the best place for sushi.
Prices are reasonable."

Always have a clean table ready to go with fast and friendly service. Diverse and affordable menu, with the best ramen I’ve ever had. Everything is made to order and comes out fresh and hot. Price for food is reasonable for the quality and quantity received, with big dishes of sushi. Their spicy crunch wrap is amazing and their ramen is the best in the city."
IKUSA Izakaya & Tokyo Market,Sushi Bars,"903 General Ave NE Calgary, AB T2E 9E1 Canada",AB,51.0529833,-114.041292,3,"We have visited Ikusa a few times so far and we enjoy it every time! This time we visited on Fri night. We did not need to wait, they have daily special and Fri was sake 20% off. We ordered many sushi, Yakitori, ramen and oysters.

The best thing was oyster. I recommend asking server because they have different selection every time. Next was the big roll with tuna and avocado. The roll had toro and less fatty part together, I enjoyed it a lot. Not great part was ramen. I never liked their ramen, actually thick noodle was not too bad but the soup is one of the worst ones you can find in Calgary.

They have retail section and they have a lot of Japanese stuff at pretty affordable price. They also have bubble tea to go!

Overall I had good experience!"
IKUSA Izakaya & Tokyo Market,Sushi Bars,"903 General Ave NE Calgary, AB T2E 9E1 Canada",AB,51.0529833,-114.041292,5,"I love the vibe here! It was lively, but didn't feel crowded. The high ceilings made it feel very airy. We have oysters, sashimi deluxe and a bluefin roll. All delicious 😋"

Ordered the Rock n roll and the fire dragon roll, with a couple maki rolls and some nigiri.
Both specialty rolls were delicious and well prepared, fresh and held together perfectly. The maki rolls had a generous amount of fish and were simple yet delicious. Nigiri was great too with nice big pieces of fish.
Intimate little place with very friendly and welcoming staff.
Thank you for the service and quality food. I will certainly return and recommend."

The pork gyoza was crispy on the outside, soft in the middle and was very delicious. Sashimi was fresh and generous cuts. Fire Dragon Rolls were personally my favorite. Could have used a little more spice/heat, but very delicious. VuDoo Rolls were decent, not our favorite but still good. Service was friendly and prompt. Thank you!"

We tried the beef barbacoa, pulled pork, crispy fried tilapia, chicken tinga, and chorizo tacos on flour tortillas. All were delicious and prepared well.

The service was also great and fast! Añejo’s is definitely worth a visit (or more)."
Añejo Restaurant,Mexican,"2 - 2116 4th Street SW Calgary, AB T2S 1W7 Canada",AB,51.0337323,-114.0712445,5,"The drinks, were super tasty, service was great. Food was pretty good. Had the table side guacamole which was delicious. The tacos were good, the pork taco was excellent. Though the fish taco doesn't come with any sauce so it is quite dry. I'd recommend pico de gallo with it for some moisture."
Añejo Restaurant,Mexican,"2 - 2116 4th Street SW Calgary, AB T2S 1W7 Canada",AB,51.0337323,-114.0712445,4,"Found this little gem thanks to Google. The restaurant itself was decorated perfectly.

We started with the hand made guacamole at our table. Which was awesome.... The tacos followed with Mexican rice.

This restaurant could be a five star with a different waitress.  She didn't have any time for us at all... And complained the whole time (when she wasn't on her phone) that she was cold.

The waiter who made our guacamole was amazing as was the bartender. (A true mixologist)"

It felt like everything we picked was incredible, the steak and fries were not too salty, the pasta and sauce were perfectly done and complimented each other, the seafood pasta tasted fresh and the burrata cheese appetizer was amazing. The jam and cheese worked so well together. I am also happy that our food came with vegetables, it feels like most restaurants nowadays forget they exist. 🥹💕 I want to visit here one more time and Try other dishes too. And they didn't turn on loud music, I can talk with my friends comfortably."

The quality of the food, variety, wine and beer selection is exceptional. Our waitress Tracey was very friendly and made great suggestions.  I can' t wait to go back to this lovely restaurant."
The Nash,Bars,"925 11th Street SE Calgary, AB T2G 0S8 Canada",AB,51.0415773,-114.0369915,5,"It was my first time coming to the Nash and I'm actually very pleasantly surprised!! Usually ""Canadian Fare"" type places would have very mediocre plant based options, but it was totally the opposite!

My partner and I shared the two main vegan options and they were actually SO good. The fritters were so crispy and big, and the risotto was flavourful and hit the spot. They even had a vegan spice cake which was seriously so good.

Our server was super gracious and polite, so needless to say, a 10/10 experience. Thank you!"
The Nash,Bars,"925 11th Street SE Calgary, AB T2G 0S8 Canada",AB,51.0415773,-114.0369915,4,"1st time here with a friend. The appetizer was confit garlic with feta cheese & bread. It tasted so good. The chicken Rissoto was super filling and tasty. The dessert was a cherry chocolate mousse. Not too rich but, just right! The service wasn't remarkable."
The Nash,Bars,"925 11th Street SE Calgary, AB T2G 0S8 Canada",AB,51.0415773,-114.0369915,4,"I love how this restaurant celebrates the buildings roots. The first page of the menu gives a timeline of the building and it’s various uses over the decades. There is also a large map mural on the wall from the 1910s which as a calgarian was very fun to look at!

Our server, Wendy, was wonderful and had exceptional table manor. The restaurant itself is very warm, and sophisticated.

As for the food! We got the lamb gnocchi with ricotta to start, and it was phenomenal. I could have eaten it as the entire meal. It has the perfect notes of mint coming through to complement to meat.

For our mains, my partner got the NY Strip, and I got the house special, which was a prime rib that night. Their steak was good, but could have had more seasoning. The prime rib was cooked perfectly, however, I again found that the meat itself was a bit flavorless and all of the flavor came from the sauce. The prime rib also came with sweet potato donuts, which had no flavoring. I love sweet potatoes, and was really hoping for something amazing.

Overall, the meal was good, but I was expecting it to be exceptional given The Nash’s reputation."
The Nash,Bars,"925 11th Street SE Calgary, AB T2G 0S8 Canada",AB,51.0415773,-114.0369915,5,"First time at Nash. It was a great culinary experience, with Chef Michael looking after us royally.

We will make sure to return."

I had the pork tenderloin with garlic mash and the wife had the maple chicken curry. Both meals were very flavourful and the portions were larger than expected. We both felt full at the end of the meal without a starter or a dessert. Both were about 25 dollars which in this day and age is reasonable price.

The staff were pleasant and quick. The tables were fairly well spaced out and the overall atmosphere felt welcoming. We will definitely be back to try more dishes."

We usually arrive/order between lunch and dinner hours so sometimes there’s some confusion when it comes to what the kitchen will make but they’re usually pretty accommodating!
I’ve only ever had a problem once with a server who came to our table, asked us what we wanted to drink, took our order, and then asked us what we wanted to drink again. It was a funny story for later on, but a little bit awkward when it happened!"

We tried a variety of items including the Lobsterlicious Corn Chowder which online says it is a starter. It is only available in July so not on the menu day to day. Well if you order it, it comes with a small lobster roll as well! Just be prepared for a lot of food as we ordered mains as well!

We also ordered the scallop platter which was deep fried scallops with fries.

My wife ordered the lobster roll which was incredible. Fresh and full of meat. Not a lot of mayo so no lobster flavour lost

And my friend and I each got the lobster dinner. Had the choice of lobster size up to two pounds! Could have had the chance to pick our own but we all got busy chatting and never did it.

Had a very nice patio and water front as well

Worth the stop!"

The starter came swiftly and was excellent. As soon as we finished the water was so attentive, it was no time when the special arrived.
We enjoyed the food immensely  and can't  wait to make another reservation.
I would not hesitate a second to recommend  this restaurant for a visit."

Top notch food, and service, make this place unbeatable. The Olive Tree has a relaxed casual vibe; is nicely decorated, and is really clean. The food is not only delicious, but is also appealing to the eye as well. They are wheelchair accessible and offer take out too. Highly recommended!"
The Olive Tree,Mediterranean,"137 Victoria Road Sydney, NS B1P 2V5 Canada",NS,46.1449173,-60.1768408,5,If heaven had a taste it would be here at this hidden gem. My taste buds were doing the happy dance. Very comfortable place. Small town atmosphere with a big town taste. Thoroughly enjoyed myself. The cooks must have been trained by mom cause it felt like a great home cooked meal. I know you never see them but tip  them well. It was a pleasure meeting the waiter and maybe owner cause he treated us like he knew us and we were part of the family. He had a great sense of humor and didn't mind showing it. Had a great relaxing time. Big thumbs up for all involved. A place out of the way but worth the drive. Six out of five. Give them a try.

Red Barn Gift Shop & Restaurant,Seafood,"2 Cabot Trail Baddeck, NS B0E 1B0 Canada",NS,46.0944602,-60.8661147,5,This is a very nice gift shop on the Cabot Trail. It had a huge selection of products with reasonable prices. There is an upstairs gift shop too. The staff are friendly and helpful. They have a restaurant but it doesn’t open until 11am. This place is well worth the stop!

Colettes Place,Canadian (New),"201 Brookside Street Glace Bay, NS B1A 1L7 Canada",NS,46.1861423,-59.9603082,5,"Staff was great and friendly.

We felt like we got a true taste of the Cape Breton lifestyle when we visited this place. It was recommended to us by the lovely lady in On Paper Books, and I have to say, she was spot on! The food was delicious and wonderfully priced, the people were so much fun, and we got to talk to some of the colourful locals that call the area home. An overall excellent experience!"
Colettes Place,Canadian (New),"201 Brookside Street Glace Bay, NS B1A 1L7 Canada",NS,46.1861423,-59.9603082,3,"Food is delicious. Service is not good. The last 3 times we went the food was great, the service is mediocre at best! Today when we went was the last time. 3 bad experiences in a row and I am done. After ordering drinks and food, they didn't bother to bring drinks OR utensils until AFTER our food was already out, we ordered breakfast, not finger foods. Why order drinks first if they can't be bothered to bring them.
Rather than coming to the table when we needed something they ignore for ""daily"" customers. We had to walk to the counter many times just to get a straw or a fork or anything."

Their all day breakfast is so delicious and cooked and prepared to perfection. The prices are very reasonable. The staff are so happy and friendly.

Lobster Kettle Restaurant,Seafood,"41 Commercial Street Louisbourg, NS B1C 1B5 Canada",NS,45.917458,-59.975012,5,Located just beside the sea. Easy to find. They serve very freshly cooked seafoods and high quality chowder. The snow crab dinner is aweeeeesome!!!
Lobster Kettle Restaurant,Seafood,"41 Commercial Street Louisbourg, NS B1C 1B5 Canada",NS,45.917458,-59.975012,5,The last few times I have visited Louisbourg I always came to the lobster kettle because it was a perfectly mediocre meal. This last time I came to visit I ordered crab expecting nothing much. It ended up bring the best crab I have ever had. It was almost melting in my mouth and had a wonderful flavor to go along with it.
Lobster Kettle Restaurant,Seafood,"41 Commercial Street Louisbourg, NS B1C 1B5 Canada",NS,45.917458,-59.975012,5,Friendly staff and delicious food! definitely worth stopping by on your way from or to the Fortress of Louisville. Recommend the lobster poutine when it’s in season!

Flavor 19,Cocktail Bars,"1229 Grand Lake Rd Sydney, NS B1M 1A2 Canada",NS,46.1714108,-60.0980753,4,"What stood out at Flavor 19 was the amazing service we got from Michelle. She was quick to greet us at the door, super friendly and attentive the whole time. She always filled our water, made conversation, and we never had to wait too long between courses!

The Greek souvlaki pita was delicious and so was the macaroni and cheese with crispy chicken. Really enjoyed cheesecake dessert too (only pic I took). Portions did feel a bit smaller than expected given the price but still satisfactory. Decor of Flavor 19 felt a little bit dated… I expected a more modern restaurant. Did not affect my experience though. Overall I would go back, there are so many great things on the menu it was so hard to choose!!"
Flavor 19,Cocktail Bars,"1229 Grand Lake Rd Sydney, NS B1M 1A2 Canada",NS,46.1714108,-60.0980753,4,Good food but somewhat pricey.  Service is great. The atmosphere is a bit on the institutional side because there is no real atmosphere in the restaurant.

The staff were great to work with from a year out with the initial planning, the tasting to select the food that our guests raved about, to the big day which went off worry free with all the details looked after. They were upfront and professional the entire time and easily accommodated any of our special requests. We had about 90 guests which the space easily accommodated and facilities were great."

Chicken Shack,Southern,"295 Commercial St Cape Breton, NS B1A 3C5 Canada",NS,46.193986,-59.9548601,1,"Just ordered the hot chicken sandwich from the chicken shack in Glace Bay, it was the most disgusting meal I had ever gotten, ordered gravy on the fries, there was that much gravy that the fries were soggy, the sandwich was pieces of scrap chicken over it and full of grizzle was that salty that I couldn’t eat it. That’s my last order from there it was totally disgusting. I wouldn’t recommend this restaurant at all the meal went into the green bin"

Chicken Shack,Southern,"295 Commercial St Cape Breton, NS B1A 3C5 Canada",NS,46.193986,-59.9548601,4,"I like this most times… wish they had coupons or something other than just daily specials.

Also an oven improvement is much needed for your pizzas, they always arrive not cooked enough with very pale cheese, give us some browning, bubbling, and burnt crust please."
Chicken Shack,Southern,"295 Commercial St Cape Breton, NS B1A 3C5 Canada",NS,46.193986,-59.9548601,4,"Very clean, friendly, very tasty food.  Took awhile to get or food but was worth the wait. Good prices."
Chicken Shack,Southern,"295 Commercial St Cape Breton, NS B1A 3C5 Canada",NS,46.193986,-59.9548601,1,The food was good but was charged 62.00 dollars for a 32.00 dollar meal was charged twice  not good
Trio,Diners,"Cambridge Suites Hotel 380 Esplanade Cape Breton, NS B1P 6P4 Canada",NS,46.136269,-60.195818,5,"Great place to stop and dine. The food is just great and well put cooked just right.
There is always something different for special deals and the deserts menu is a daily thing. cost can vary much like the more fancyer restaurants but its still a good price. It has a nice and cozy feeling while seated lots of light. There is a good drink selection for a decent price. If you are staying at the hotel you can get it brought to your room if you wanted to be in a more quite environment"
Trio,Diners,"Cambridge Suites Hotel 380 Esplanade Cape Breton, NS B1P 6P4 Canada",NS,46.136269,-60.195818,5,"Had a great meal with my mom last Friday night. We had the prime rib special with Bourbon demi glaze, mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. We also had some wine and split the warm brownie for dessert. Everything was delicious and our server, Nikita, was really lovely. She even took our photo for us infront of the Christmas tree. Great ambiance, nice food, good beverage selection and very cozy. Super friendly staff! ❤️👌"
Trio,Diners,"Cambridge Suites Hotel 380 Esplanade Cape Breton, NS B1P 6P4 Canada",NS,46.136269,-60.195818,5,"The seafood chowder was one of the best I've ever had and Aaron the bartender was very attentive. I had the Blackened Haddock, which was fantastic as well. I highly recommend this modern restaurant if you're looking for great seafood in Sydney."
Trio,Diners,"Cambridge Suites Hotel 380 Esplanade Cape Breton, NS B1P 6P4 Canada",NS,46.136269,-60.195818,5,"We had a nice breakfast. Service was a little slow compared to the city, but not prohibitively so. I think this is more of a local staffing issue than the fault of a singular restaurant."
Trio,Diners,"Cambridge Suites Hotel 380 Esplanade Cape Breton, NS B1P 6P4 Canada",NS,46.136269,-60.195818,4,"The wife and I went for a make up valentines date. She had the beef tips and I had the beef sirloin. The food tasted great and came quick. However the starch was larger then expected and the meat on the sirloin was a little smaller then expected for 35 dollars. The drinks were good, service was welcoming. Over all a good place slightly over priced and the decor comes off as a diner trying too hard to be modern."
Grubstake Restaurant,Seafood,"7499 Main St Louisbourg, NS B1C 1K7 Canada",NS,45.9213056,-59.970087,5,Service was great. Food was wonderful and jazz playing on the stereo was cool. I highly recommend the shrimp and scallop flambe.
Grubstake Restaurant,Seafood,"7499 Main St Louisbourg, NS B1C 1K7 Canada",NS,45.9213056,-59.970087,3,Good basic down home grub.  We had the haddock. I’d order this above most else if we go again
Grubstake Restaurant,Seafood,"7499 Main St Louisbourg, NS B1C 1K7 Canada",NS,45.9213056,-59.970087,5,"My wife and I had excellent seafood meal's. I am generally not a big fan of fish, but my wife had such a good experience with haddock in the area, I had to try it. It was excellent, among the best fish I gave eaten. He scallops were excellent as well. For dessert we made a special request they were able to accommodate and the blueberry pie with local wild blueberries was just right. Service was attentive and thus was an overall very nice vacation experience"
Grubstake Restaurant,Seafood,"7499 Main St Louisbourg, NS B1C 1K7 Canada",NS,45.9213056,-59.970087,4,"Our server was very polite and helpful. The hot turkey sandwich I had wasn't quite what I was hoping for but my group all loved their meals. A good place for even large groups. (they easily accommodated our six and then another group of twelve that came in. The main seating area is quite nice.

I noticed the owner responds to Google reviews, which in my mind demonstrates a lot of care in the business."
Grubstake Restaurant,Seafood,"7499 Main St Louisbourg, NS B1C 1K7 Canada",NS,45.9213056,-59.970087,4,"A family meal after a visit to Loiusburg went over very well!  The kids options were delicious but for the price it would have been nice to have a drink or dessert included.

The haddock burger and chippers were great. The burger was a touch overdone but the flavours were awesome and I wouldn't hesitate to get it again.

The service was prompt and friendly. Our server was very knowledgeable and honest.

Thanks for the good food experience!"
Flavor On the Water,Canadian (New),"74 Esplanade Sydney, NS B1P 1A1 Canada",NS,46.142254,-60.199794,4,"We got their seafood platter which had two lobsters, haddock, scallops, mussels, shrimps, potato salad and garlic bread. The service was amazing! The employee who was managing our table was the sweetest ever! Music selection was great as well. The only reason I'm giving it 4 starts is because the scallops were a bit over cooked. Other than that everything was awesome!"
Flavor On the Water,Canadian (New),"74 Esplanade Sydney, NS B1P 1A1 Canada",NS,46.142254,-60.199794,4,"First time visit.  You would not normally consider port dining excellent dining.  This is an exception.  We had the fiddle burger and the lobster club.  The lobster club with fries was excellent.  The fiddle burger was a little dry but the fries were excellent.  The service by Jackie was excellent.  Also had a red wine sangria and a cosmo, both were good to excellent.  Come enjoy the view, staff and food."
Flavor On the Water,Canadian (New),"74 Esplanade Sydney, NS B1P 1A1 Canada",NS,46.142254,-60.199794,5,"Tried the special and it was large enough to be shared by four people. There was a good variety with lobster, fried fish, bacon wrapped scallops, crab cakes, and shrimp. We were seated outside which had a nice view but there was a very loud ship by the harbor. The service was ok which is understandable given the busy time and the staff were friendly."
Flavor On the Water,Canadian (New),"74 Esplanade Sydney, NS B1P 1A1 Canada",NS,46.142254,-60.199794,3,"This place has a very high rating, but maybe just when compared to other places around Sydney. In real life, for us, it was a very mediocre place.
Let's start with benefits - available close  parking, nice atmosphere with a view, and super friendly and professional staff.
However, the food is not as good. The lobster was good, but the ribs were boiled I guess and then smothered in bbq sauce before they were served. The burgers were also just fine, nothing extra ordinary. Maybe you can come here to enjoy a drink, but not for a bigger meal in my opinion."
Flavor On the Water,Canadian (New),"74 Esplanade Sydney, NS B1P 1A1 Canada",NS,46.142254,-60.199794,4,"Nice spot for a dinner with lots of fresh seafood options.  Service was ok - staff were nice but not checked up on as much as I would expect.  Would be a great spot when the weather is nice and could sit on the patio.  We shared the east coast crab cakes - delicious!  Not too bready, lots of crab meat, and paired with a jerk aioli and pineapple salsa.  I had the seafood linguini which had lots of seafood but the sauce was very rich and heavy.  The fish and chips were nicely crisped, not overly battered and fried - just how we like it!  I would return to try other menu items."

Tons of baked goods, great breakfast. Super friendly service. I'm actually adding to this review because of how wonderful this place is. Going here was a major highlight of our time in Baddeck, such a warm spot to visit. One new drink I tried was unreal. The Heat Wave Spritz, so so good."

I had a Yummy salmon bagel!! The cream cheese was top notch and the bagel to cream cheese ratio was excellent…… There was many treats and breakfast choices.

Lebanese Flower Restaurant,Mediterranean,"14 Dorchester Street Sydney, NS B1P 5Y9 Canada",NS,46.1407052,-60.195992,4,Good Lebanese restaurant with a variety of options. It was not busy at all around 2 pm on a Saturday. We sat in and ordered the Okra Stew and the Shish Tawouk. Service was quick. The Okra Stew contained very soft okra and tasted overall like a lentil soup. It also came with a few pieces of pita and a plate of white rice. The Shish Tawouk contained grilled chicken with a red sauce that was wrapped up in a pita. Both food were ok. The water served was room temperature which wasn’t ideal. Lebanese music was playing from the speakers.
Lebanese Flower Restaurant,Mediterranean,"14 Dorchester Street Sydney, NS B1P 5Y9 Canada",NS,46.1407052,-60.195992,2,"Gastric Distress...We chose this restaurant based on high Google ratings but were let down. Good espresso but shawarmas, both chicken and lamb, had unfresh or ""off"" ingredients. We were unwell for hours afterwards."
Lebanese Flower Restaurant,Mediterranean,"14 Dorchester Street Sydney, NS B1P 5Y9 Canada",NS,46.1407052,-60.195992,5,"Such a wonderful visit to this restaurant. The night we went in it was nearing close so we had prepared ourselves to possibly being turned away but the owner(?)/ gentleman, working took us in graciously despite having the dine-in down section cleaned and closed off. His warm, welcoming and funny service made the visit such a delight. Then came the absolutely incredible food. I’ve had chicken Shish Tawouk at other places but the one here had such a unique flavour. Whatever they are doing is working because I considered going back the next day despite only being in Sydney for 2 days. Their baklava and meat& cheese fatayer is also out of this world. From service to the food it was a spectacular visit to Lebanese flower."

The Old Triangle Irish Alehouse,Irish,"424 Charlotte Street Sydney, NS B1P 1E2 Canada",NS,46.1359507,-60.1943837,4,"Overall place  had a Irish vibe through out the time as good place to come with your family or partner a good quality time could be spend here . Rick assisted and showed a good hospitality. Now lets talk about food i ordered 1 )Belfast burger - well cooked had different layer of ingredients but the drawback was that pickle inside the burger made dominant flavour which suppressed all other flavours now the fun thing i removed the pickle now the burger just tasted burger cooked with salt and pepper , i asked rick for some ketchup and as it already had mayo/dressing inside so putting bit ketchup made that taste like sundried tomato flavour which made rest of burger flavourful.but overall speaking burger was fulfilling enough was cooked perfectly can’t complain on that

2) fries were perfectly brown , cooked and crisp 10/10
3 ) brownie gluten free - this brownie was nowhere near by the standard brownie the upper half of brownie tasted like sour cream cheese cake and rest bottom down felt like no bake chocolate fudge  and to be honest it didn’t go well as thought , as brownie expected thing was should have be light weight baked with whip cream might have a given that exact brownie expected . But if it had a drop of lemon on the top of this brownie could have tasted like lemon chocolate tart .."
The Old Triangle Irish Alehouse,Irish,"424 Charlotte Street Sydney, NS B1P 1E2 Canada",NS,46.1359507,-60.1943837,5,I had the blackened haddock and smashed peas.

Only consideration was the fish and chips…..they were a 6/10- the fish was over cooked. This is a rarity however as I have had the this dish several times in the past."

There wasn't much opened in town that day, and I felt like they did a great job managing a busy dining room. Spacious and well organized and the staff was working hard to take care of everyone.

Our table enjoyed the surf and turf and the Irish beef stew along with some drinks and the warm gingerbread with whiskey caramel sauce. Everything was delicious and good value for the prices. Great job!"

We felt like we got a true taste of the Cape Breton lifestyle when we visited this place. It was recommended to us by the lovely lady in On Paper Books, and I have to say, she was spot on! The food was delicious and wonderfully priced, the people were so much fun, and we got to talk to some of the colourful locals that call the area home. An overall excellent experience!"
Talo,Cafes,"195 Commercial Street Glace Bay, NS B1A 3B9 Canada",NS,46.1957961,-59.9559516,3,"Food is delicious. Service is not good. The last 3 times we went the food was great, the service is mediocre at best! Today when we went was the last time. 3 bad experiences in a row and I am done. After ordering drinks and food, they didn't bother to bring drinks OR utensils until AFTER our food was already out, we ordered breakfast, not finger foods. Why order drinks first if they can't be bothered to bring them.
Rather than coming to the table when we needed something they ignore for ""daily"" customers. We had to walk to the counter many times just to get a straw or a fork or anything."
Talo,Cafes,"195 Commercial Street Glace Bay, NS B1A 3B9 Canada",NS,46.1957961,-59.9559516,5,"What a gem of a place. .The food is amazing in flavour and presentation. Their all day breakfast is so delicious and cooked and prepared to perfection. The prices are very reasonable. The staff are so happy and friendly. They are always smiling which gives the whole eating experience an added joy.  I went there with one friend and have returned three additional times with other friends. I literally.cannot say enough about this charming little restaurant. I shout out to Bertha, Darlene and Jayden. These woman are awesome. 😊"

They taste great but take them about half an hour to make one. I understand homemade. I'm in the food industry. But wait time was unacceptable IMO. Chicken  dinners were super.

The chicken and sides are average but the staff is very friendly. It is a classic drive-up building and if the weather is nice you can sit at some picnic tables outside to eat. If sitting outside orders will be called out over a loudspeaker for you to grab your grub from the window.
Make sure to take a photo with the sign!"

Excited he bought 5 pieces of chicken. Fries and gravy were ok. THE CHICKEN, the worst he has ever seen or eaten AND he is not a picky eater. He had to throw the whole box away.. The pictures say everything.. and so busy. I guess you don't have to care... so salty and old oil.. the strongest stomach can not handle this"
A & K Lick-A-Chick,Fast Food,"384 Park Road Little Bras D'or, NS B1Y 1N3 Canada",NS,46.244744,-60.274635,1,"Rating so low because the chicken is overcooked, dry and the oil hasn't changed for long time. Unfortunately you cannot like this chic!"

It is a bit pricey for what you get, and the portions are a bit on the smaller side. We had an array of different dishes and the best ones were the Thai bites and the red curry chicken (this was actually so amazing and would definitely order again). The pad Thai was not the best, and the rice and pineapple chicken were kind of medicore, especially for the price."

I have yet to be disappointed in a dish or meal here. No issues with suggestions or substitutions and every meal is exactly what I was craving.
The portions are generous and the price is more than reasonable.
If Asian dishes are you thing, do yourself a favour and check it out while in town."

The staff are very friendly, they were nice to us and I noticed the same attentiveness with others in the restaurant. The food had generous portions but was quite different than Thai food we’ve had elsewhere. The Tom Yum soup was okay, unfortunately the shrimp were very over cooked and it had rice noodles in it. The Pad Thai also had over cooked shrimp (although not as over cooked as the soup) and the noodles were cooked a bit much for this dish. The sauce was not like other Pad Thai sauce I’ve had - it was a bit bland but not terrible. All in all it was an acceptable meal. Another curiosity - the bottle of soy sauce said Kikoman but I’m pretty sure that it had been refilled with a different brand..."
Fat Boys,Pizza,"438 8th Street New Waterford, NS B1H 3S7 Canada",NS,46.2492234,-60.0852817,3,Their pizza is terrible. But everything else isnt that bad. Their customer service isnt that great either. The only reason I put 3 stars is because their garlic buns are pretty good.

But your guys service is really good 👍"

Three Doors Down Diner,Diners,"474 Chebucto Street Baddeck, NS B0E 1B0 Canada",NS,46.0996499,-60.75231,4,"Overall this is a good spot.

The place is located on the side of the building.

Interior during the pandemic allows for reasonable seating capacity.

Service was also good and quick.

The menu options are straightforward and prices are agreeable.

We ordered the chicken burger combo, and a clam combo as well as an iced tea.

The burger was very good, breading on the patty was crispy and the burger was appropriately mayo'd. The lettuce would have been crispier it was a tad wilted. Additionally the burger was pretty small.

The clams were spot on, excellent breading.

Iced tea was good. Not super sweat.

The one thing would mention is the fries. The texture was good crispy outside, however a critical flaw was present. A complete lack of salt. The issue is that once out the fryer the things harden up and without that initial salt kick any salt you try to add on basically bounces off.

Oh one big plus one of the knives we got was made by Thor. So that's awesome.
Overall good."

The seafood chowder was milk based, very favorable  but not too thick and gummy. My lobster was cooked perfect - tender not over cooked. We also got the haddock fish and chips  which was so fresh and seasoned just right.. We would also recommend the local lager they have on tap. My wife and I are from New Orleans and know great food - this place was had it."

Lovely patio at the front. Simple menu with good variety. If you have had enough fish chowder; their French Onion soup is delicious.

True Cape Breton hospitality. The chowder was absolutely delicious and loaded with fresh seafood. Appetizer of Mussels cooked perfectly. My son had the seafood pasta alfredo, same thing he had last year, he’s been looking forward to it. Huge scallops and prawns cooked perfectly. Fish and chips were fantastic. Lobster, again cooked perfectly. Hand cut fries! But the ‘icing on the cake’ are the desserts made in house. Gingerbread cake and a rhubarb crumble, just to die for. You really don’t get perfect experiences in restaurants any more. This was a 5/5!"

The wings were nicely done and crisp and the salad was delicious with the best poppyseed dressing I've had.  Now lets get to that burger.  Homemade, thick, juicy and so tasty.  We dined overlooking the Baddeck waterfront with excellent service.  A fine way to spend an afternoon!!!"

Alas, once delivered, I sadly received a pizza with raw pepperoni under the cheese. I wish this were the worst part, however the pizza also seemed to be completely lacking in any kind of seasoning, also contrary to their pictures online (I can only assume at this point that they used stock imagery of pizza). It was the most bland pizza I've ever tasted. My dog didn't even want the bits I couldn't finish..."

Bacon under cooked l, sausage burnt black? Eggs & toast cold, pancake was dry.

Only plus is that the server was excellent.

I have picture of it. We called the manager and show him that, he said i will give you the another one and will not charge you for that. We were fine and waited for it. In the end while asking for bill, we saw he charged us for pizza and put 50% off on another pizza (which was more cheaper). When we asked them, they said “Oh sorry, that’s what our manager said, or i dont know if this is any confusion’’ Are you serious???

New Moon Chinese,Chinese,"78 Townsend Street Sydney, NS B1P Canada",NS,46.134587,-60.193011,3,The food is fantastic. However the portion size for the amount of money you pay is terrible I ordered a dinner for five I was only feeding two I figured it would be two dinners for us for 2 days there's no way. I'm lucky it fed us for one meal because the portions are extremely small not worth the money however it is tasty but I won't get it again too expensive for the portions. Picture shows such a small amount of food for $67

Peking Restaurant,Chinese,"355 Charlotte Street Sydney, NS B1P 1E1 Canada",NS,46.1373432,-60.1941838,3,"Clean place, because no one is dinning in here...
they do a lot of take out orders, so if your looking for a place with a quiet place for lunch or dinner this is the place.
The food is okay, just average but atleast not terrible.
The service is average as well, I guess the server is so used not having customers.
This place needs more life, and just a bit more lighting.

Overall its an okay place to eat. Food is served hot, but I do find some dish can be a little to salty."
Peking Restaurant,Chinese,"355 Charlotte Street Sydney, NS B1P 1E1 Canada",NS,46.1373432,-60.1941838,5,I had bought 4 meals as a fundraiser and am I ever glad I did. This will be our Chinese food place going forward. Everything was delicious and the portions were very generous especially for a fundraising meal. I had been going somewhere else for so long I perhaps got complacent on what good Chinese food is. I will be back soon. Thanks
Peking Restaurant,Chinese,"355 Charlotte Street Sydney, NS B1P 1E1 Canada",NS,46.1373432,-60.1941838,1,"We ordered Friday April 1 around 5:45. The girl took our your, it was a good size order. We waited and hour then called back, the girl said it just went out. Another hour went by, I called again and I got a message saying they were closed. We never got the order, so the girl lied about it just going out. I don’t get it. We were regular customers over 20 plus years. I Never will order from here again. You just lost a loyal customer."
Peking Restaurant,Chinese,"355 Charlotte Street Sydney, NS B1P 1E1 Canada",NS,46.1373432,-60.1941838,5,I've been eating here since I was a little girl and the food is amazing.

Peking Restaurant,Chinese,"355 Charlotte Street Sydney, NS B1P 1E1 Canada",NS,46.1373432,-60.1941838,1,Tasteless and very mushy. Ordered takeout and didn't get everything i ordered (but paid for). I ordered the special rice...it was mushy. There was a big clump of white rice in the middle..and it was slightly less than 1 cup for $14. Def not worth it. There were 3 less egg rolls then I ordered and paid for with no sauce. The person at the front didn't say hello or even talk to me. I walked in. They staired at me ...i said hi I'm here to pick up my take out order. They left look at a bag and said a price. I paid and they said it's that one over there. I picked it up and left. Not welcoming or friendly...the order was incomplete and the food was not good. They did clean the credit debit machine b4 i paid tho.

So I called as asked if it was possible to get half and half, I was told yup no problem. Early the next morning I got a call from an employee who wanted to know if I really wanted both flavours. I said yes and I very much felt like I was inconveniencing this person. She told me there would be an additional charge, I agreed. I picked up the cake later that day. As we are eating it, were searching for the Oreo section with no pb cups, except there isn't any. They mixed both flavours together. This is not half and half, it was not what was ordered or confirmed by the lady who took my order and I was charged more. I am not impressed and will not order a cake from this place again."
The Wine Cellar/Steakhouse @ the Glynmill Inn,Seafood,"1 Cobb Lane Corner Brook, NL A2H 2V3 Canada",NL,48.9479881,-57.9387519,1,"I would like to shout out the exceptional service provided by the waitstaff, who exhibited great attentiveness and amiability throughout the dining experience. Unfortunately the culinary experience presented was a significant disappointment. Considering the establishment's label as a ""Steakhouse"" and its associated price range, the lack of AAA, USDA Prime, or Canadian Angus beef is indeed disheartening. Furthermore, the lack of knowledge regarding the duration of dry aging when I inquired is a significant oversight, as it holds huge importance in delivering a proper steakhouse experience. Given these factors, it is difficult to justify the prices charged for the menu items on offer.

Mindful of this after asking waitresses, I played the safe route for their burger, presuming that one cannot go wrong with  a classic choice. Prior to placing the order, I took the initiative to inquire about the freshness of their Cod, with hopes of indulging in the renowned Newfoundland variety. However, it was disconcerting to learn that the Cod was frozen, and there was no information available regarding its capture date. To further assess the establishment's caliber, I ordered a side of Risotto, which typically serves as a clear indicator of a restaurant's culinary prowess. Unfortunately, what was presented was an overcooked rendition akin to commercially available Uncle Ben's Rice.

The Caesar salad, priced at $16, proved to be one of the most disappointing elements of the meal. It featured predominantly pale lettuce leaves, scantily dressed with an overly tart lemon vinaigrette, and lacking the generous sprinkling of parmesan one would expect. Once my burger arrived, I was greeted with a disheartening sight—a sizable bun, admittedly of good quality, dwarfing a desiccated patty that had seemingly lost all moisture within a mere half-minute. Admittedly, the burger did exhibit a commendable fat-to-beef ratio, which could have been an appealing characteristic had the establishment prioritized quality control.

While it is not my intention to disparage an establishment unjustly, I must express my disappointment as a visitor drawn into what appears to be a tourist-oriented establishment. As someone who travels extensively, and with family members who traverse the country in pursuit of memorable dining experiences, the exorbitant pricing coupled with the lackluster culinary execution is truly disheartening. It is my sincere hope that the management takes measures to address the issues plaguing their kitchen, as I believe such changes are necessary to restore the establishment's reputation. Until these concerns are adequately resolved, I would advise potential patrons to consider alternative dining options.

The Wine Cellar/Steakhouse @ the Glynmill Inn,Seafood,"1 Cobb Lane Corner Brook, NL A2H 2V3 Canada",NL,48.9479881,-57.9387519,2,"Great service (the only reason I'm giving it a second star).  The food LOOKS spectacular... But it's like they forgot to season everything.  We both ordered starters and mains.  Of the four dishes, the duck confit was excellent and perfectly seasoned.  The remaining starter (mushroom with crab and cheese), and the mains - seared tuna with rice noodles, and a crab linguine - it's like they were made by a rookie chef who forgot to add any seasoning whatsoever.

When you're at an upscale restaurant, paying upscale prices - you don't expect to hear everyone around you asking the servers for salt.  Yet that's exactly what was happening - including ourselves.  The dishes simply had no flavor.  It's not that I like overly salty foods either - the dishes could have benefited from citrus and other spices to brighten them up, and add some depth.  It's no fun spending nearly $200 on a meal you can barely choke down.

I expect a lot better from a place that bills itself as high-end."
The Wine Cellar/Steakhouse @ the Glynmill Inn,Seafood,"1 Cobb Lane Corner Brook, NL A2H 2V3 Canada",NL,48.9479881,-57.9387519,5,"I set a surprise supper reservation at the Wine cellar for my 3rd anniversary with my girlfriend.

The atmosphere was cozy, and intimate. The decor a mix of modern and vintage. Maybe 14 tables in a circular layout that was very warm and inviting, comforting.

Our server Shelley was so polite and personable, so very accommodating, attentive. Very professional and well versed in the menu items and drinks. Based on our preferences made a lovely wine recommendation we enjoyed for the evening (Red Sangria)

We had the caesar salad app. Fresh, crisp romaine I believe on top a French baguette with a perfectly balanced dressing. Crunchy and juicy pork belly for the usual bacon topping and a very healthy topping of fresh parmesan. Our entree was the Chicken supreme with an onion soubise. Marinated in a garlic herb buttermilk, seared to perfect chicken thigh that was perfection in the center, just a touch of pink (which you can have without it bring undercooked if you didn't know) and very moist. Flavor throughout the entire thing, topped with a creamy onion sauce. Rested on a bed of creamy, cheesy risotto. I don't like rice, at all. It may have been my favorite part of the entire dish, that I'd go back just to enjoy again. Served with roasted asparagus and cherry tomatoes. Everything was so fresh and balanced each other just so, especially our wine pairing. We finished our supper with one of each dessert all delightful in their own right... I cannot remember the name of our favorite, just that it wasn't the Ukrainian honey cake or dark chocolate cherry moose though still better than most desserts in town. The cook, Andrew O'quinn, is certainly doing something with food I have not experienced anything alike in corner brook before, I swear it was one of the best meals we've ever had and cannot wait to go back again soon.

I highly reccomend sitting in for a night if you find yourself in Corner brook for the evening and wish to experience one of the finest dining experiences I know to exist on Newfoundlands west coast at the Glynmill inns Wine Cellar."

We had breakfast included with our stay. Somewhat disappointed in the meals. Yogurt and fruit - yogurt was commercial grade and the fruit bowl consisted of pineapple, melon, grapes, melon, and apple. Blueberries are in season - why not use seasonal fresh fruit?  Eggs and bacon were ok as were the potatoes and toast.  the service did not live up to the White table cloth dining room. Coffee carafe and cups were placed on the table and server left of up to you to pour your own’. This also happened at dinner on the one night we stayed in - water and wine with appropriate glasses left on the table with no intent of being filled by staff. For the prices charged, I will have expected a bit more customer service. Dinner was ok -the temp  of the food was cold when it was served to us- should have all been hot. Sauces came in plastic containers."

They do not use msg or too much salt in their foods.  They use fresh vegitables in their dishes unlike other restaurants in town that use frozen veggies.  It always tastes fresh.  I have eaten in the am, pm, and afternoon and always recieved great food and service.  I definitely liked the way I felt after eating.  I have eaten at all chinese restaurants in Corner Brook and always felt a ltlle stomach sick afterwards.  (much like the way after Micky D's)
I have brought my dad there and even after eating at the dragon restaurant for 30 years he agreed this restaurant was better.  I highly recommend this place.  As for previous comments regarding staring I have not noticed this... neither do I care."

It’s a bit on the expensive side. We went all in and ordered 3 signature rolls, 3 appetizers and drinks and with taxes and a decent tip we paid around $150. Expensive but totally worth it in a place where all you find is fast food and deep fried food.

The service was great! The server was very attentive and took her time to walk us through the menu and suggested all the popular items."

The restaurant itself is on the smaller side but for every meal served it looks like 4 more were going as takeout. Presentation of dishes 10/10. Quality of dishes 10/10. Flavor of dishes 10/10. It was the first time I've been offered premium Wasabi. I'm not sure what was in it, but it was very good.

However, I found the flavors to be rather average, lacking the taste that I was hoping for. Considering the price point, I believe there is room for improvement in terms of the taste and quantity of the sushi."
Newfound Sushi,Japanese,"117 Broadway Corner Brook, NL A2H 4B4 Canada",NL,48.9532293,-57.9562189,3,"Price was very high compared to taste. It was very average both in taste and quantity. By quantity I mean the weight of the sushi is probably less than other sushi places, that's why we had to order more than usual. Other than that, the view and customer service were top notch."
Newfound Sushi,Japanese,"117 Broadway Corner Brook, NL A2H 4B4 Canada",NL,48.9532293,-57.9562189,4,Sushi was super yummy and spicy. We ordered one with crab and avacado and another with tuna and avacado .We had bluberry magarita and Newfound caesar cocktails as well. Everything was really good. But the space was the limiting factor. Dine in option was limited due to limited space. But we could grab a seat in the bar and had our supper. Ladies in the bar were very friendly and attentive .

However, we did have to wait quite a while for our food and the service took longer than expected.

Moving on to the food itself, it was alright; nothing too special that made a lasting impression. While we enjoyed what we ate, it didn't have any unique or outstanding combinations that stood out."

Excellent drinks with a lot of thought put into both the mixed drinks and the beers (loved the Shake 'n' Bakeapple in particular). Good was also mostly great. The veggie dumplings and cinnamon bun were both disappointing, but everything else was fantastic. Highly recommend the arancini, the pasta, and the spring rolls. The burgers were also great, and we loved the garlic butter on the appetizer bread. All in all very happy."

We should have made a reservation but who would have thought on a Monday night....We were offered seating at the bar, which was fine. We weren't at the bar too long before being reseated by the window. We started with the Mussels. We have eaten a lot of mussels but these were top of the chart. They were in a tabasco sauce, not hot but a nice touch of heat. The mussels were slightly bigger than we are used to but they were cooked to perfection. My wife ordered the fish tacos appetizer, which she said were excellent. I ordered the burger special with a lettuce wrap. The lettuce was perfect and I was able to actually hold the burger to eat it. The burger was cooked precisely."

Food was okay. Didn’t try much of the menu so I’ll reserve judgement. It was also a bit on the expensive side

We ordered a bahn mi sandwich and the meat was frozen when we got it. It was taken off the bill.

Overall a bit disappointing but I’d be willing to try again"

I had the cold rolls (rice paper rolls with noodles, veg and meat w/ side of peanut sauce for dipping) and the medium size beef and beef ball soup. Mostly I enjoyed that the chop sticks, sauces and napkins are on the table when you arrive.
I really like this tasty meal, this is a recommended stop in Corner Brook NL.
I did find it a bit hard to find once you arrive - you go in the door to Coleman's and down the ramp to the right towards the BMO bank machines."

Service: Fantastic, ready to wait on you. Knowledgeable. They didn't put anything in the bag. they only gave us chopsticks for our soup? it would have been nice to get some spoons, napkins, hot sauce. I guess I should of asked. 4/5

Food: Unfortunately, I didn't feel the sate beef pho. Didn't lived up to itself,
Beef and the chicken Pho Sate did not match have the flavors blended well. A spiciness and heartiness was missing.

I ordered the smoked chicken with the Lamplighter BBQ sauce, mashed potatoes, coleslaw and cornbread.  The entire meal was served to me in 7 minutes.
Thoroughly enjoyed the coleslaw and mashed; the cornbread was a little too dense for my liking but very tasty.  I found the smoked chicken to be very dry, and I wasn't a huge fan of the BBQ sauce.  I also ordered their Bluebeary Ale which I would definitely have again.

All in all, next time I'm in town, I'll give it another try.  Based on other reviews, I'm sure the other dishes on the menu are worth the try."

As my rating goes this place has so much potential but it could be way better definitely wouldn’t eat here again
the moistness of the meat and fall apart aspect of it 10/10 the seasoning and Flavour aspect 1/10 was not there was not giving

Mac and cheese was a 0/10 was no flavour noodles weren’t even al dente they were hard

Mashed potatoes 10/10

The meat platter was 5/10
The five was the fall apart aspect and tenderness but the chicken was very dry
The sausage was amazing !

The barbecue sauces need to be blended a lot more if these are home made but as of those I’d give a solid 4

Burnt ends 8/10 !!

Brisket was 5/10

Cornbread 10/10

Ribs 2/10 was not giving what it needed was very dry and lacked flavour"

Our server, Shilo, was amazing and she certainly is an asset for your place. We had a 9oz house wine and a 16oz house Pilsner, an order of cajun wings, burnt ends and the brisket poutine. My wife loves burnt ends and said the smoke flavour was just right, not too overpowering. She would have liked them caramelized blacker more though. Very tender pieces. My hit was the poutine with brisket on top. That brisket was perfect. Melt in your mouth. The gravy and fries complimented the brisket perfectly. A meal all on its own. The wings were good but nothing to write home about.
The glasses, plates and cutlery were all top notch and classy and the finishing in the restaurant is more upscale that a standard barbeque joint. You could come here for a nice supper with friends and feel pampered.
My bill came to $71 with the tip, which Shilo definitely earned. Her attention to our booth was perfect and she has a great ability to chatter up the clients. We will be back. Thank you management and staff."

The Bandeja Paisa is big and worthy. The beef soup is a little bit expensive for the size and I was expecting a stronger flavour. The tequeños were too salty, I have tried them before there but this time was way too much salty. The empanadas are delicious and their salsas are marvellous"

I had an incredible experience thanks to the amazing manager, Bianca. She went above and beyond to ensure that my St Burger was absolutely amazing. The staff were incredibly friendly, and I was impressed by the spotless cleanliness of the bathrooms. The icing on the cake was the cold and refreshing fruitopia (as it seems there’s a shortage everywhere else). St Hubert Express sets the bar high with their exceptional service and attention to detail. Kudos to Bianca and the entire team for creating such a wonderful dining experience!"
Rôtisserie St-Hubert,Chicken Shop,"22 Trinity Avenue Fredericton, NB E3C 0B8 Canada",NB,45.9299566,-66.6646002,1,"Absolutely disgusting restaurant! So many tables full of garbage. Most (not all) of the employees were rude and disrespectful. Food was overpriced. The benches, ground and tables were all dirty. I will never be returning to this absolutely awful establishment."
Rôtisserie St-Hubert,Chicken Shop,"22 Trinity Avenue Fredericton, NB E3C 0B8 Canada",NB,45.9299566,-66.6646002,1,"Very disappointed of that location. I have uploaded a picture so everyone can see how bad the food quality you get at this location.

First we ordered 2 “St-hubert poutine”. When we got home, there was NO cheese in both poutines. (So we added some square pieces at home). Second, the chicken was so dry, that even the WATERED DOWN gravy (that wasn’t gravy, just tasteless brown sauce), they give you couldn’t soften the batter. Lastly, the fries felt so old that even the microwave could make them softer.

I do not recommend this location to anyone. And it’s a shame for the prestigious St Hubert brand unfortunately."

If you’re looking for lunch for a conference or staff party, look no further these folks have it handled. Whether it’s the wonderful attitude from the lady on the phone taking your order or the kind smile from the restaurant manager himself delivering it to you, they go above and beyond. To top it all off the meals are always delicious and never anything wrong or missing, they get it right.  Will definitely be ordering for lunch again and will definitely let anyone else I know looking for catering to head this way!!!"

Found a cozy spot inside next to the water in their indoor bar seating. Had few drinks(That ocean cocktail was excellent). The Fish and Chips were nice with very less oil. I tried their Candied Bacon Burger which was a pleasant surprise. We also had the Maple Curry Chicken Penne Pasta which was decent. All in all, a good experience. Will probably come here on a cooler day again to try eating at their patio as the view seemed even better."

From the start, I knew I chose well. Excellent and attentive service from Morgan went a long way to making our afternoon stop enjoyable.

And then there’s the menu. So many things sound so good - took me a while to decide. But choosing the pulled pork wontons for an appetizer was the right move. Y-U-M. Everything we had was terrific. We’ll worth the ferry ride from Halifax. If I lived nearby, I could easily see myself eating my way through the entire menu!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 🌟"

Had little bit of everything there. The wings we're so delicious. The Buffalo chicken sandwich was good as well the poutine was average but also good. Had there garlic fingers the garlic fingers were good. But the wings are to die for one of the best place for wings I when too. Great size great sauce 👌. They also put on a great breakfast in the morning for guests lots to choose from really enjoyed eating here. Everyone was nice.

Tonight, we had a wonderfully friendly waitress who was bubbly and excellent. A friend and I had the pulled pork boa. It was amazing! Soft and juicy! Highly recommend trying them next time you are at Trendz!"

Started with the mussels which were lightly seasoned and sitting in a beer-based broth with nice pieces of focaccia. Fish tacos were quite nice. The buffalo chicken sandwich had a lot going on. There was bacon, lettuce, and cherry tomato on it as well. The vinegar was a little strong in places but was good overall."
Trendz Café and Wine Bar,Wine Bars,"15 Spectacle Lake Drive Dartmouth, NS B3B 1X7 Canada",NS,44.7001792,-63.5823395,2,"I’m reviewing this based on a takeaway order. We travel with a dog so don’t have the opportunity to dine in anyplace.  If you are looking at takeaway back to your hotel I’d suggest finding another restaurant. We had two orders of the mac n cheese and a Caesar salad. Each mac n cheese was maybe a cup and a half of elbow macaroni in a rather ordinary cheese sauce. The ‘caesar’ salad was a bunch of kale with a side of dressing and some kind of fried Parmesan chip on top. No croutons, no shredded Parmesan. How they can call it a Caesar salad is beyond me. This three dishes totalled almost $50, even with a 15% discount, and were completely not worth it. We were very disappointed with what we got for that kind of money. Very little value or enjoyment at all. Now, if you dine in that might be a completely different story, I cannot vouch for that, but for takeaway look elsewhere."

Tide and Boar Gastropub,Gastropubs,"700 Main Street Moncton, NB E1C 1E4 Canada",NB,46.0886189,-64.7757054,5,Heard good things about this place and it lived up to the expectations! The mango was a great addition to the mango poke. The beeramisu and cheesecake (subtle peanut taste) was amazing. The food was ready fast but the service was a tiny bit slow (grabbing our orders and bill) even though it wasn’t super busy. I would definitely recommend!
Tide and Boar Gastropub,Gastropubs,"700 Main Street Moncton, NB E1C 1E4 Canada",NB,46.0886189,-64.7757054,4,"Visited this location today and chose a nice shaded area on the outdoor patio. Atmosphere is nice, it smelled divine because they were smoking meat just a few meters away from my table at the back of the patio. Server was kind and courteous, the food was served quickly. I specifically asked for a salad instead of fries and that my burger be served without lettuce (I was trying to avoid anything overly carby) but was served a burger with lettuce and with fries. I advised the server that my order wasn't right. It was quickly resolved, yet the fries remained, which were begrudgingly eaten because they were in front of me. That being said, the fries were perfectly crisp and the Tide and Boar salad had a wonderful range of flavors thanks to the grilled vegetables and granola. The burger left much to be desired though. While the chicken breast was flavourful, it was uneven which resulted in a nice, juicy and tender side, while the larger side was very dry. This was my first visit to this establishment. The food was good enough for me to warrant another visit to try something else off the menu."

The Pump House Brewery and Restaurant,Breweries,"5 Orange Lane Moncton, NB E1C 4L6 Canada",NB,46.0899482,-64.7743279,5,This place is bigger than it appears. Busy when arrived but sat quickly. The food was good. Would have liked an option for a veggie burger but the mussels with beer bread was really good. Did an interesting beer flight of craft beer and cocktails. For example lemoncello with beer. Was very good.
The Pump House Brewery and Restaurant,Breweries,"5 Orange Lane Moncton, NB E1C 4L6 Canada",NB,46.0899482,-64.7743279,2,"8oz steaks are a disappointment for this pub; definitely on the cheap side for slabs of meat and very thin. Asked for a medium rare but because of how thin it is, they had trouble getting that red center and got it closer to medium-well which was unfortunate and quite dry.
Won't be ordering another steak if I frequent this place again.

Service was also relatively slow, though to be fair it was quite packed for a Thursday night.

Closing notes, there's other places to go if you're looking for beer and lunch. They may have great beer, but as such they also sell it to other pubs in the area and it'll taste just as good."

Cinta Ria Malaysian Restaurant,Asian Fusion,"161 Robinson Street Moncton, NB E1C 5C2 Canada",NB,46.0877142,-64.7792218,4,"I'd suggest booking a reservation before going as when we went there most of the table were either filled or is reserved. It was a Friday dinner.

The service is excellent. We didn't have to ask for our water be refilled or our plates be taken out of the table. The waitress that time just cleared our plates after a few minutes we finished our appetizers and refilled our water as soon as we emptied it.

The restaurant looks nice and clean. The staff are friendly and very polite too.

As for the food. I personally find some of the food we ordered a bit bland and others are really good but according to my friend who was with me that time the food I find a bit bland was okay. Id suggest trying their MUST TRIES as it was one of those I ordered that I enjoyed very much."

Gusto Italian Grill & Bar,Bars,"130 Westmorland Street Moncton, NB E1C 1G2 Canada",NB,46.0878414,-64.7785706,3,"Overall, the impression of the establishment is good, thanks to its modern interior. The size of the venue is impressive, with two floors. The first floor has VIP tables and a small open area, while the second floor features a large open space with a big bar and an open kitchen. If you don't like it when it's noisy, the second floor is not for you, and if you want to have a conversation, it's not ideal either 😅

The menu is excellent, but there is a lack of non-alcoholic beverages. There were only two sweet cocktails in the main menu, which is not great for such a restaurant. We ordered risotto and pepperoni pizza, and both dishes were very tasty and lived up to our expectations.

As for the downsides of the evening, the unexpected letdown was the waitress who served our table. When I asked for non-alcoholic wine, the waitress reacted as if she didn't know it existed. Then I asked her about the non-alcoholic drink options since there were only two cocktails listed in the main menu. However, she pointed to the same cocktails and said that was all they had. It turned out they had coffee as well, but unfortunately, no one informed me about it when I asked for non-alcoholic options. And when I asked if they had tiramisu, she didn't respond and just said she would better bring me a dessert menu (which didn't include tiramisu). There was a small incident with our drink, and the manager came to our table and said they would replace it. However, the waitress approached us after about 10 minutes and asked if we wanted to replace it with the same drink or another one, which confused us because the manager had already told us they would replace it with the same one and bring it soon. In the end, after those 10 minutes, we had to wait for another 10-15 minutes. She didn't even smile much, which was very strange. I haven't experienced something like this before.

Overall, such service is not acceptable, and it spoils the positive impression of the restaurant. I came to the restaurant with a smile and in a good mood, but I left in a bad mood on my birthday.

However, the rest of the staff seemed very pleasant and friendly. Therefore, overall, I recommend this place."
Gusto Italian Grill & Bar,Bars,"130 Westmorland Street Moncton, NB E1C 1G2 Canada",NB,46.0878414,-64.7785706,5,"Kristen W was amazing during our time there.
We went for my birthday celebration as we were in Moncton for the weekend. After some research, this place popped up multiple times so we decided to go there for the dinner. To say the least, hands down, this place has the best Italian food that I ever had. So full of flavour, richness of herbs and spices being used in a perfect balance is just fabulous. Loved the time and the food.
Overall, definitely worth the money, even more worth than the money you spend here because the serving size is considerably big for the price. Will be back when i visit Moncton again!
Thanks Kristen"

Would recommend the carbonera linguine, and the italian butcher pizza, and the arancini for an appetizer. La Carolina merlot was a perfect pairing. Highly recommend! And the cheesecake!! Do it!

After trying 7 different chowders across PEI and NB, we found ourselves coming back to Skipper Jack’s for the 2nd time just for the seafood chowder. It was so flavourful that every mouthful packs a punch. Very generous with the amount of seafood as compared to other places.

Fish and chips were on point. Fried clams were okay.

A must-visit in Moncton!"

Saint James Gate,Seafood,"14 Church Street Dieppe, NB E1A 8J6 Canada",NB,46.0885825,-64.7783229,2,"Disappointing experience at St. James gate on Friday July 21. We went for the buck a shuck, but I also ordered a spinach and scallop salad I previously liked. Oysters were missing from our order. When the salad came out - it was not with spinach, it was with regular lettuce. I wouldn’t have ordered it had I known about the substitution. I mentionned it right away to the waitress. She assured us that if we kept the salad they would make up for the mistake when it came time for the bill. I assumed it would be a discount, which I was fine with - we didn’t want to make a fuss or return the meal. After the waitress came to confirm we were done and brought us our bills. I asked what the waitress meant when she said there would be an adjustment in the end to make up for the salad mix up. Looking rather annoyed, she said she could offer us a free desert or glass of wine - but by that time we were ready to leave. She said we could remind her next time we see her, which seemed rather impractical, and odd. Although we tried to be pleasant, we found her increasingly rude as the evening went on. I alone spent more than 60$ there that night, not including tip, and felt let down for the price I paid. We tried to reach out to management before posting this and did not get any kind of response."

Waited over half an hour to have our finished plates removed from the table, waitress never even came back to see if we wanted any more drinks. She came to the table and just asked if we wanted the bill… didn’t even offer a dessert menu. Server brought the bill, over $150, should have been around $65. I didn’t even notice just tapped my card. Had to go back to get a refund. Watch your bill when it comes to the table. Other couples seated were waiting a long time to even get their order taken. High expectations, bad experience."

The seafood chowder was packed with fresh seafood, and the lobster mac & cheese tasted amazing with chunks of lobster! We also got the lobster pappardelle was really flavourful, just wished the portion is a little bigger. It tasted great!"
Red Satay,Vietnamese,"201 St George Street Moncton, NB E1C 1V6 Canada",NB,46.0916324,-64.7815261,1,"I heard lots of good stories about food. And I want to try the place for some time now. Unfortunately my first experience was less than 2 minutes. Went to the restaurant about 4.45pm. A couple of tables were filled and over 10 tables available. I asked for a single table and he (Server) pointed out the middle table right in front of the kitchen. I kindly ask for a corner table for peaceful dining. And he said No.

I just opened the door. And came out. Am not going to visit again for service like that."

Red Satay did not disappoint!  Jenny’s special was fantastic. Wonton broth was far from the usual chicken broth taste as well.  Loy was a great host!  Thank you!

Intimate, fabulous French menu, and warm service. Resos recommended but they were able to accommodate us (just kindly noting when the next party would be). Pricey but tasty. Two of us shared two small plates and two mains, and that was a good amount of food. (Portions appear small)
Wish the Coquilles St-Jacque was more traditional.

Menu in English & French. I don’t think they do brunch anymore, just dinner.

Highly recommended."
Les Brumes du Coude,French,"140 Botsford Moncton, NB E1C 4X5 Canada",NB,46.0932177,-64.7783668,5,This place is a nice French Bistro that I had the pleasure of having lunch at with my party.  I have eaten here several times and both the food and service are consistently excellent.  We had the seafood pizza which was fresh and made on their wood burning stove which made it extra tasty.  We also had  the borrata which was delicious.   I would recommend this place for anything from a romantic date to dinner with the family as they were welcoming to all these groups.  Make sure to make reservations as it's a popular spot.

I get the Misso Ramen and come with half egg , veggies and 3 delicious pieces of chashu! You can park your car on the street or Park Spots near by. The price is fair for the quality delicious food. One think … the lady who attended us Jane was superb and super professional, arigatou 🙏🏼"
Tokai,Japanese,"823 Main Street Moncton, NB E1C 1G1 Canada",NB,46.0883825,-64.7794266,5,"First time trying this place for ramen.  Had Tonkotsu ramen with an extra gyoza dumpling. Delivered by skip the dishes. Was piping hot and delicious!! The broth was tasty, pork chashu was nice and thick and had great BBQ flavour, the egg was a little overdone but that's to be expected with delivery, you only get half an egg as well, which I thought was a little chincy for a $20 bowl of ramen. That is pretty much my only negative though."

Osaka Hibachi,Japanese,"599 Main Street Moncton, NB E1C 1C8 Canada",NB,46.089562,-64.7741749,5,"For my first visit I was blown away by everything and will definitely return. We went as a group and I recommend the grill table experience where the chef cooks the food in front of you. The ambiance, service and food was excellent. We were not rushed out even if our group was the last one of the day and we left just after their closing time. I would recommend a reservation for the table cooking experience. Can't wait to go again!"
Osaka Hibachi,Japanese,"599 Main Street Moncton, NB E1C 1C8 Canada",NB,46.089562,-64.7741749,3,"You can reserve your table ahead to avoid waiting time. We waited for around 15 minutes so it was not that bad. The food overall it’s ok, nothing that really stood out and made you go woooo!

Osaka Hibachi,Japanese,"599 Main Street Moncton, NB E1C 1C8 Canada",NB,46.089562,-64.7741749,5,"Everything was delicious and fast. We liked the hall, done in a Japanese style. However, we didn't enjoy the dessert; it was too sweet. We would have preferred a wider selection of Japanese desserts, such as classic mochi."
Osaka Hibachi,Japanese,"599 Main Street Moncton, NB E1C 1C8 Canada",NB,46.089562,-64.7741749,3,"Went for a sushi dinner with my husband. The sashimi was a bit of a let down; some pieces were improperly cut, but they were a decent serving size. When we made mention of this to the server, she apologized and said this is how it's typically made.

For the rolls, the salmon rolls with spicy mayo were delicious. The fancy rolls were not quite to my liking, but were a fun addition to our meal.

Service was friendly, and the atmosphere was calm. Pricing was reasonable."
Osaka Hibachi,Japanese,"599 Main Street Moncton, NB E1C 1C8 Canada",NB,46.089562,-64.7741749,5,"Great dining experience, the live chef was entertaining and fun. The reason they lost stars for the service is the waitress wouldn't come back for drinks and also didn't smile, she looked miserable. Luckily the Japanese lady took over and we could make the most of our evening."

Highly recommend the roasted tomatoes & whipped feta appetizer, and the tuna poke bowl was super filling.

Pro tip - you can get mini versions of the desserts so you can pretend you’re going to share them with your date, and eat 2 desserts on your own without feeling judged by society!"

But the special and my favorite part for going there is desert 🍲 that is sticky toffee pudding it’s so so so good . Doesn’t matter how full I’m I always sit there and enjoy the delicious desert. Atmosphere is also so cool and calming I always go there for dinner so it felt so referencing 🌌after work because of good music and interior. Hope so I will visit this weekend to😊.
The Homestead Restaurant,Canadian (New),"358 Coverdale Road Riverview, NB E1B 3J5 Canada",NB,46.0668796,-64.7964071,5,"Been to this restaurant twice thus far. I knew from the first visit, with my lovely wife Pat, that this was a very homestyle eatery.
Hospitality is fantastic while the service has been top shelf.
Upon entering, noticing all the happy customer I could see this was a regular to many patrons, always a good sign. As my son pointed out, if there's a lot of older customers, it must be good because they wouldn't waste their money on a place with bad food nor terrible service.
Both Pat and I enjoyed every morsel. During this last visit, neither of us ordered anything to drink other than water which was provided gratis. This combined savings allowed us to order their coconut pie. I had asked before hand if the pie was made within the restaurant. I was assured it was. I asked if it was actually made from  scratch and was promised it was (I always dislike those packaged pie mixes). I must state that it was a superb coconut pie served with whipped cream topping (I did have the option  of a meringue topping). I look forward to tasting all their many other deserts over our subsequent visits in future.
The bread is also made in house and both Pat and I enjoyed the bread provided as well.
We look forward to many years of future dining at this wonderful restaurant."

The Homestead Restaurant,Canadian (New),"358 Coverdale Road Riverview, NB E1B 3J5 Canada",NB,46.0668796,-64.7964071,4,"Very cozy and friendly restaurant.

The staff seems to be very well organized and friendly. I ordered the meatloaf special at a reasonable price. 👍
Sorry to say but I didn't make the right choice for me.  Tomatoes sauce covering the meatloaf was to much, it was too juicy and it's over powering the taste of the meatloaf itself. Didn't like their choice of vegetables either, I think it was turnup and carrots mashed together. 🤢 Although it certainly was a good size portion and it looked phenomenal.

I've read the reviews for here and there is a lot of positive reviews.
I will absolutely make another trip there and try a different meal, maybe a turkey dinner.
The pastry there looked fantastic, I'm definitely have to try that as well.

Not to sure on the closing time but I think its closes at 7 Not 8:30pm as it says on the book. You may want to call if having a late dinner 🍽 😋"
Japan Go!,Sushi Bars,"687 Main Street Moncton, NB E1C 1E3 Canada",NB,46.0889116,-64.7763851,3,"This place is nice and cozy. We were there during the afternoon and the sunlight coming through the windows was fantastic!

Prices were not high, food itself was good. It is wired - I wanted to go here, I love sushi, but after eating some simple rolls I realized I like Superstore's sushi more. My guess is that it's just my personal taste. Because nothing was wrong with what we ordered.

Unfortunately the lady who was helping us didn't know much about the menu/could not really help with the choice. Otherwise she was pretty friendly and attentive to our needs.

Flies crawling on our food and flying around was no fun 😔 waiting for 30 minutes while the place was empty we didn't enjoy also."
Japan Go!,Sushi Bars,"687 Main Street Moncton, NB E1C 1E3 Canada",NB,46.0889116,-64.7763851,5,"Great portion, we ordered an assortment. Very tasty and quick.

Japan Go!,Sushi Bars,"687 Main Street Moncton, NB E1C 1E3 Canada",NB,46.0889116,-64.7763851,5,I took my wife here for our anniversary. The food was amazing. Great quality and it was prepared in a timely manner. The presentation was amazing as well. The service was very good. The establishment was clean. The bathroom was ok but could of been cleaner. Their patio is nice and well spaced out. I would most definitely recommend this for any sushi fans.

Very comfortable beds. Very clean room. My son and I went to the All You Can Eat BBQ Ribs buffet on Wednesday night.  It was fabulous. My wife and I went to the Thursday night Roasted Chicken buffet, and it was OK.
I wouldn't go that buffet, again.
Note: You have to be 18+ to eat at buffet because you have to walk through the Casino.
We brought grandkids to IHOP and other places for breakfast,  lunch and dinner. We went to a lot of other attractions in the area and a movie."

Do Casino NB Moncton NB has there work cut out to serve something that's acceptable???
WOW. NOT good. I would be ashamed to work in the Buffet area:((("

That being said, the enchiladas are the only thing I order anymore because they're absolutely AMAZING to the point I don't want to try anything else haha I'm sure the rest of the dishes are all great but the enchiladas have my heart. Very large portions, even my carnivore fiance enjoys their food and is actually full when we're done. Would highly recommend!"

All their menu items can be made vegan and I tried it with cashew cheese. Firstly, the nachos should be drenched in cheese but wasn’t. Secondly, the pizza could have been better too w.r.t cheese. The ginger lemon drink was good felt really relaxed after drinking that. Totally loved the burger. But good try on veganizing the food. I appreciate that and will rate it 8/10. Still a must try place. Will visit again to try the nachos with tofu cream :)"

Great tasting food and a fine selection to choose from. Though not vegetarian, was delighted to find that we enjoyed the meals we ordered thoroughly.

Update July2023: Made it a point to visit this restaurant again on our recent visit to Moncton. Not disappointed at all. The soup of the day was Carrot Ginger soup which was excellent served with crunchy sourdough bread slices coated in an oil based garlic coating.  The Indian pizza was very tasty."

Turned out to be the best decision I made that day. They legit served a three course meal just for the price of one dish and every single component was fresh and tasted good. Bulgogi was amazing!! Even the pickle was great! And can not give enough props for the service.
Keep it up guys!! 👏👏"

It was the best place to bring our family for a special occasion. We all enjoyed meals we would not typically have.

Sadly some meals look and taste different when you come back again and ask for them. There was a change in presentation, taste and even the condiments. That was disappointing for us because it was the New York steak and the first time it was amazing but not the 2nd and third time."
The Keg Steakhouse + Bar - Moncton,Steakhouses,"576 Main St Moncton, NB E1C 0M6 Canada",NB,46.0895633,-64.7732673,5,"Our server was so attentive and delightfully nice :) to start I had the wedge salad with dill ranch, tomatoes and crunchy crumbled bacon it was refreshing and satisfying and the bacon was so good. We also had the baked garlic shrimp - hot cheesy baked shrimp, so delicious, and addictive but the perfect bite before a meal, great for sharing too if you're not into eating too much before your meal. They also serve hot bread with whipped butter, so keep that in mind, it's so yummy and hot and hard to pass up with that soft butter.
I had the blackened chicken with garlic mash and vegetables. The chicken was amazing so moist and the blackened seasoning was so savory - as my boyfriend put it ""I've never heard you make a noise for chicken before, so I'm going to have to try this"" he agreed it was that good!! He had the Steak and Lobster, the lobster came with a little side of butter heated by a tea light. And it was all cooked so perfectly. The steak was medium and the lobster nice and tender. All in all an amazing evening, we highly recommend and will definitely be back!"

I went there two nights in a row for business dinners and both times it was on par. The food was the same as if I was at the Keg in my home town (so thats a win for uniformity on the franchise) with no issues. The food was great. The server we had each night was fantastic too. The first night I was there though I will mention it was offaly dark like someone had dimmed the lights too much and people were expressing that openly, the second night it was noticeable lighter. 100% I would go back to this restaurant anytime I am in the area. All around 5 Stars."
The Keg Steakhouse + Bar - Moncton,Steakhouses,"576 Main St Moncton, NB E1C 0M6 Canada",NB,46.0895633,-64.7732673,4,"Nice experience. We haven’t been to a keg in over twenty years since we lived in Vancouver. The atmosphere here is very warm and relaxed and the staff are welcoming and friendly. We asked for a booth, which was very comfortable, and the dining area was an enjoyable sound level with pleasant background music. Our server was attentive and our drinks and meals were served promptly. The meals we chose were ribeye, New York strip, blackened chicken and Mediterranean cauliflower. We all tried bites of each other’s meals (except for the person who didn’t eat steak). The steaks were yummy, but we both wished the Chicago char had more of a crust to it. The chicken was very flavorful and juicy but was a little salty for me while not for others. The cauliflower was pretty awful - no one wanted it - it was very bland and when it got to the table, it was barely lukewarm. (I understand a steakhouse isn’t a good place for vegetarians, but if you are going to have a couple entrees for them, they shouldn’t be throwaway meals that the kitchen gives no care to.) In addition, the twice baked potato was good, the French fries were crispy, the garlic mashed potatoes were not great, the vegetables were okay, the mushrooms were flavorful, the Caesar salad was great and the garlic cheese toast was good too. Bernaise was nice but the little picture was barely half full and it wasn’t enough for a big ribeye steak - that was kind of stingy. However, the desserts we tried were the lemon tart, crème brûlée and Billy Miner’s Pie, which we all shared and were all rated lick-the-plate excellent. Expensive at over $300 but a nice if rare treat. I would recommend going here for a special occasion."

They do have a very good collection of menu. Covered most of popular dishes from most of Aisan Countries. I really like the Shanghai noodle! They also carry a good dessert menu Which most Asian restaurant don't.   I was little bit worried about the price when i saw the dressed up waitress and fancy decor. However the price is totally affordable. Would definitely suggest to anyone especially to people who dont know.what.to.order. all of their food is delicious

The spring rolls were the best I've ever had and their Pad Thai is fantastic. Prices were more than fair for the amount and quality of the food. Wait times for the food was well spaced. Waitress was absolutely amazing and felt bad that I would have to pay for a refill when I asked for a second beer. Gave a 27.5% tip, it was well deserved."

The restaurant is nicely decorated and has a comfortable but intimate vibe to it. The food was absolutely delicious and the staff was superb. My plate was visually stunning (I really wish I had thought to take a picture of it!) with all the bright, colourful vegetables piled high over crispy noodles. It also had a very generous portion of chicken in it which was delightfully surprising. We were at the Dieppe location and were very pleased with our entire dining experience. If I could give it 10 stars, I would. If you're looking for a delicious Asian meal at a reasonable cost, run, don't walk, to Mai Asian in Dieppe!"

Tajmahal Flavor of India,Indian,"882 Main Street Moncton, NB E1C 1G4 Canada",NB,46.087927,-64.7797716,5,Must try their chola bhatura best in Canada. They are open only from 11 am to 2 pm and 4pm to 9pm and closed on Monday. It's worth to make a trip to moncton just to have their choley bhaturey .I have not tasted such even in India. They are the best.

If we order a veg Thali it will look like a typical Indian hostel canteen/PG food. Neither pricey nor generous in quantity but worth a visit during lunch hours."

Definitely would return and have already been recommending.

Keep up the great work!

We ate as a larger group and food came out at Turtle speeds. There were only 2 other people in the restaurant at the time, so not sure why it took so long. The kicker was of the 4 items I had ordered for the wife and I, two of them had long hair in it (they came out at different times too!) Would have liked to give more stars; but the interaction with the staff just was brutal. Such a shame really. Over salted mush food and portions don't justify the price. Coming from Toronto, maybe we are just lucky to have much better food in the GTA."
The Old Triangle Irish Alehouse,Irish,"751 Main Street Moncton, NB E1C 1E5 Canada",NB,46.0887209,-64.7776264,5,"Update February 2023 - After a few more visits this place is quickly becoming a favorite. The food and drinks are always great, and the service has been to notch rent time.

Just to put the pricing in perspective, our family went to Boston Pizza and spent 105.00 for mediocre food and soda. For the same number of meals and two beer / apple juice for the little one we spent 85 including tip. Great value for good food and service.

The poutine is awesome - with or without cheese curds.

The staff are always friendly and attentive.

Kid friendly during breakfast and lunch hours."

Only issue was portion. I wish I had taken a picture when they arrived, however I thought that there must have been a miscommunication and I had ordered a half pound. The bill said different. I understand food costs, I'm chief cook on a ship that spends 7wks in the arctic, I order a lot of food. However, this is ridiculous. Not pleased. Do not recommend."

House Of Lam,Chinese,"951 Mountain Road Moncton, NB E1C 2S4 Canada",NB,46.1027508,-64.8149228,4,The food was fresh and really tasty.  Everyone seemed to have enjoyed their meal.  The service was exceptional.  Table was pre-set to accommodate our reservations.  The waitress was continuously asking how things were and If drinks needed refilling.  The only issue I had was the Caesar was not good even after a 2nd attempt.  But over all I would give a 9.5 out of 10.  We enjoyed our experience at the house of lamb. :)

House Of Lam,Chinese,"951 Mountain Road Moncton, NB E1C 2S4 Canada",NB,46.1027508,-64.8149228,3,"I'm really only writting this review due to accessibility issues. Google marks this place as wheel chair accessible, I wouldn't call it accessible if you can't get to the bathroom without going down a flight of stairs. Theres no elevator so you pretty much need to get out of a wheel chair to go to the bathroom. There's also no buttons to open the door,  so it's either a challenge or you have someone help you to even get into the restraunt

We did takeout instead, the food was good, little pricey. My wife wasn't happy with the way the staff treated the situation of my grandma trying to figure out if she could even handle sitting down to eat there, due to the bathroom situation."

It tasted heavenly and delightfully sweet. The ice cream was a smooth vanilla. The iced tea was a southern sweet tea, I assume, and it wasn't overpowering with its sweetness at all. The server was very polite and patient with me :) which I appreciate a lot since I was with someone that I didn't exactly like interacting with, lol."
Cafe Archibald,Cafes,"221 Mountain Road Moncton, NB E1C 2L5 Canada",NB,46.0949981,-64.7842043,3,Great service. The Crepe was delicious but tried the nutella iced coffee & caramel iced coffee both were extremely bad.

Very friendly service even though it's busy. Little space, open kitchen and adjoining outdoor type sitting next to the main door.

Oh.. almost forgot to tell you about the upstairs seating. It's unique.

Parking and washrooms available. Delivery, Take out and dining."

Service was excellent, they let our group stay for several hours to just hang out and talk after ordering! Huge shoutout to our server today around 1pm I really appreciate you! And a big shoutout to the chef! That pizza was incredible."
Cafe Archibald,Cafes,"216 Chemin Gauvin Dieppe, NB E1A Canada",NB,46.0941916,-64.747258,1,Worst meal I’ve had in a while. The veggie burger was very mediocre but the mushy old reheated potatoes trying to be disguised as fries were a bit insulting. Loud and uncomfortable experience with a bunch of us crammed in a tiny room.

The staff is super friendly. Food is  affordable and big portions.

Ample parking available and games next door.

Big selection of drinks, really fast service.

My choices for today were to select 6 sides. Had another 03 friends and it was a perfect starter. And my favorite beer here is Alexander Keith.

Beautiful atmosphere with an old plane and lots of TV screens. Dine in and Washrooms available on the site."
Sports Rock Dieppe,Breakfast & Brunch,"451 Paul Street Dieppe, NB E1A 6W8 Canada",NB,46.0949805,-64.7568321,5,"If you’re looking for a sports bar with excellent food, great customer service, and a great atmosphere, then Sports Rock Dieppe is one of the best spots to go in town!

For several years, I have dined at this restaurant, and my experience has been consistently great. As they have stated in their banner, they claim to have the “Best Wings In Town,” and honestly, I really don’t disagree with them. Along with a large assortment of meals on the menu, you also have options for just about anything you want to try, and out of everything I have eaten, I haven’t really had a bad meal. Plus, they always have a special night for wings, burgers, steak, and more! So it’s good to check their website or call ahead if you want to know what specials they have on.

Their food has usually been pretty tasty, as long as you don’t mind waiting a little longer for them to prepare it. On average, the wait time can be anywhere between 20 minutes to an hour depending on how busy they are, but they keep you busy with a large selection of alcoholic beverages, and non-alcoholic. On busy nights, I find it can get a little noisy if it's a packed restaurant, but it is a great spot in town for the whole family to enjoy.

Overall, Sports Rock Dieppe is one of our favourite places to eat, and I would recommend it to anyone who hasn’t tried it yet!"
Sports Rock Dieppe,Breakfast & Brunch,"451 Paul Street Dieppe, NB E1A 6W8 Canada",NB,46.0949805,-64.7568321,5,"Very cool place to dine.

Lots of cool stuff to look at while eating and a ton of TVs too."
Sports Rock Dieppe,Breakfast & Brunch,"451 Paul Street Dieppe, NB E1A 6W8 Canada",NB,46.0949805,-64.7568321,2,"There's this particular server who is always rude and unfriendly whenever we go. This happened multiple incidents not just with me but w/ my friends too. We're always hesitant to eat at Dieppe location because when she is our server, the service is always poor that we don't even enjoy eating. Last night we placed a small order for pick up and when my bf didn't give a tip, she questioned him 'why he didn't tip, he's also in the service industry' Mind you we always give tip when we dine in despite the treatment we get but since it was a take out order and it was her, we didn't feel the need to tip. And yet she thinks she has the right to question us w/ that attitude? I am not sure if she's being a racist too coz she seems friendly w/ other people 🤷🏻‍♀️

Hence, if we have a different server, we always eat and leave happy! And we only give good tips to good servers :))"

The desert so many options and 5 different gluten-free free ones I was so happy.    I did not take a pic of our burgers but this is the gluten-free peanut butter brownie cheese cake trust me you want to share this it so rich a d wonderful.

Big League Burgers and Wings,Burgers,"1855 Mountain Road Moncton, NB E1G 1A8 Canada",NB,46.1225928,-64.8492786,4,"Excellent service and food.  The reason for not a five-star rating is that they cut their fries too short too small, (a very small criticism) which makes them go soggy quickly.  Great portion sizes, however.  That's just a personal preference of mine, though. Some people enjoy that style of fries.  What is nice, it's made to order, and asking for well-done fries isn't an issue.  Which i quite liked.  I would go back again."
Big League Burgers and Wings,Burgers,"1855 Mountain Road Moncton, NB E1G 1A8 Canada",NB,46.1225928,-64.8492786,1,"My husband was in the mood for a good burger so we decided to try Big Leauge for a change. We went to order and the server had the personality of a stuck up cat, my husband ordered first, a double bacon cheeseburger combo, and I ordered a cheeseburger combo. Our order was almost $40. We were told nothing, not where to wait or your number is, etc. We sat at a table and our order was delivered to our table in a paper bag. Both of our burgers were double burgers, our server didn't ask if I wanted a single, double or triple, she just assumed a double and I assumed a single when I ordered a cheeseburger.  There were a lot of fries but they were all the sharp ends which were hard and crunchy. The soft drinks were from a soda fountain which we got ourselves but were not told that there were free refills. The burgers themselves were good but this is not a place that we will be frequenting again."
Big League Burgers and Wings,Burgers,"1855 Mountain Road Moncton, NB E1G 1A8 Canada",NB,46.1225928,-64.8492786,5,"The best burger place in town in my opinion. They are made fresh and the meat, cheese, and all the ingredients are good quality and very tasty. They are also very filling. The fries could improve a bit but still very good"

Really good burgers, fries, onion rings, and wings. It is on our regular rotation of places to stop in for a bite when we are looking for something different than the big burger chains. Great selection of toppings and sauces for wings. Give it a go if you like burgers and wings!"
Restaurant Hynes,Breakfast & Brunch,"495 Mountain Road Moncton, NB E1C 2N4 Canada",NB,46.0978346,-64.7961171,5,They have amazing breakfast for the price. service is awesome. It has a cozy warm Vibe and the waitresses greet you with a smile. They seem very happy to serve you. I am probably going to go back. I love the bacon and eggs with the pan fries everything was cooked to my liking. I would recommend this breakfast spot if you're nearby.
Restaurant Hynes,Breakfast & Brunch,"495 Mountain Road Moncton, NB E1C 2N4 Canada",NB,46.0978346,-64.7961171,4,"Good experience. Staff was friendly.

Lobster Roll Deluxe: It was a pleasant blend of texture. The toasted bread gave it a good warm crunch paired well with the cool fresh lobster. Overall, it was a refreshing plate and a great take on the classic lobster roll.

Lobster Benedict:
The lobster flavour was overpowered by the hollandaise sauce. The eggs were tasty and potatoes cooked with onions were a hit.

Presentation was well done. I wouldn’t come back for the Lobster Benedict but definitely for the Lobster Roll Deluxe.

Overall a pleasant experience."
Restaurant Hynes,Breakfast & Brunch,"495 Mountain Road Moncton, NB E1C 2N4 Canada",NB,46.0978346,-64.7961171,5,Very impressed by the quality of food. They even went out other way to make a healthy fish burger for me with salad.
Restaurant Hynes,Breakfast & Brunch,"495 Mountain Road Moncton, NB E1C 2N4 Canada",NB,46.0978346,-64.7961171,3,"After reading the reviews, I was disappointed with the service I received at this well known place. Arrived shortly after 11am and greeted with a smile, it was not busy when we arrived. Since it was after 11am I was informed pan fries would be extra 4.79 to my breakfast order. We surprisingly were never checked in on by our waitress who walked by multiple times. I did not receive the straw I asked for with my water and the orange juice tasted thin and watered down. My partner got the hot Turkey Sandwich with pan fries on the side, which ended up being flavourless and underdone with lots of onions.
Over all - bang for your buck wasn’t great here.
Will not be back."

Foods to die for, left with a gut buster due to over eating which is probably what happens to everyone who goes (hard time walking to the car). Everything is amazing so depends on what you're in the mood for, we wanted a little bit of everything and enjoyed everything on the menu, but also the service is east coast class (aka first class)!"

I'm fairly certain there was a restaurant by this name back when I lived in Fredericton 10+ years ago and I remember the food was amazing. It is!

Cooked perfectly and no complaints about price and portion size from me! I'll try to convince my family to join me the next time they come down!"
Saigon Thai Restaurant,Thai,"7 Orange Lane Moncton, NB E1C 4L6 Canada",NB,46.0897879,-64.7744122,5,"Today was my first time here. Food tastes very good. The place looks clean and pretty. Kitchen staff was very nice, and i feel like their speed was kinda fast even though it was busy. I will give 5 stars for the things i said above.

But the owner need to know that the server - the curly hair girl - is not good. I don't know how to describe it. I understand that the restaurant was busy and she was the only server, i don't need her to smile all the time, but her attitude was kinda rude. I know she didn't mean it, but it looked kinda racist to me. The other girl in the kitchen had to help her bring the food out, they had to handle more things than her but their attitude was very nice, i mean i just asked her few questions but her attitude was so different, so much nicer than the server. I suggest that the owner need to have a talk with her about her behavior."
Saigon Thai Restaurant,Thai,"7 Orange Lane Moncton, NB E1C 4L6 Canada",NB,46.0897879,-64.7744122,2,"Ordered take out. Pad Thai - so flavorless and dry, with clumps of noodles and not a single peanut - couldn’t finish it. Lemongrass chicken - okay, not good, just okay, with some lemongrass flavor. It had lots of vegetables which was nice. Basil tofu - sweet sauce but ZERO basil. Satay had so little flavor and the watery peanut sauce did nothing to help. Also, a chewy Imperial roll that tasted of tough cabbage and was overall so bad, we threw it in the garbage. Everything was tasteless, thrown together without any care for the customer. First time here, will never go back. Very disappointing."

Coming from Toronto if you're used to what the GTA has to offer, the tonkinese  soup is unfortunately a let down. Trying multiple dishes, the pad thai and Singapore noodles were actually pretty good. Little heavy on the salt but flavours are there. Staff were attentive and great to talk to. Would recommend the food if you just want a quick bite instead of fast food."
Rôtisserie St-Hubert,Chicken Shop,"235 Carson Road Moncton, NB E1C 0E9 Canada",NB,46.1146535,-64.8226076,3,"I have never been so shocked by a restaurant.  The waiters all seemed to be part of the LGBT community, men dressed as women, women looking like men.  My children were shocked too.  I can't believe employers let their employees look like this. For me who is a woman, it is extremely insulting to see this.  Is it possible to have neutral public places please.  I don't mind this community if they want to do it in private, it's up to them, as for those who pray or practice their religion.  Workplaces should be serious and respectful of all.  I do not recommend this place for this main reason.  the food was OK, the service there was fast and error free."

She was at a table chatting away with some seniors while we just sat waiting for over 10mins. We had our 3 little kids with us and that was a horrible first impression. I had to go complain and her colleagues went to talk to ask her to go take our orders, she made sure to finish her conversation though. Really unprofessional waitress.
The food was great and I was blown away by how kids friendly the place is, they had disposable bibs for babies, fun dishes and cups for kids and even a play room (my kids loved this a lot)
I'd definitely go back, but I'll make sure to sit in a different area to get a different server"

They always give everyone fantastic service. Never in all my years ive known them have i had the vibe of racist, unkind or disrespectful. Their great. 💖💖"

Have been here several times and today a lady in charge, Annette decided to charge me extra couple of bucks for the bowl.

My bowl does not have meat, veges, cheese, sour cream or anything. Just rice, beans, corns and guacamole. When she put literally 8 beans - had to ask for extra.

Never had this issue but it looks like they had racist staff working today. We will skip this particular store from now on.

Couple of bucks don’t hurt but being a hospitality professional myself, cannot accept rude behaviour."

We were provided free vouchers due to our elite status at Marriott. The food itself was good, although options were limited and not nearly as good as the buffet previously offered. The service was very poor on both occasions. Very long waits and not friendly at all. If not for the vouchers, the meals were very over priced. It was around $20 for a standard 2 egg breakfast."

Extremely overpriced for food I could have made better at home, and coffee in the morning took 4 people and 15 minutes to get. Very poor service and terrible food, well never return."

The food was delicious and the proprietors were friendly. I was impressed to see a brestfeeding is encouraged here sticker displayed very visibly in the front window. There is a wheelchair accessible entrance at the back but it was overgrown with weeds still usable but I am very critical on this subject. It was not advertised at the front of the building I only noticed it when I took my son to the washroom. We ordered about 6 different dishes and shared them as a family of 5 with three small children this was more than enough food but all plates were empty at the end of the meal. I did not see any high chairs but I brought my small stroller in and no one complained.

It was not busy and there were 5 staff members literally standing around.  Our food was delivered and my wings were the wrong flavor.  Did our server ever come back?  No he was too busy talking to guy at the bar about the ""fn  leafs and fn jays"".  He also appeared to be the bartender.  His attitude was horrible and the service he provided was even worse. No one asked if we wanted another drink.  Eventually another waiter came over to see how things were.  While he was polite when we explained our disappointment there was no offer to comp anything.  He did bring take out containers at least.  We used to come to this establishment frequently and the service was always exemplary.  It is no longer!!!

I just paid for a 6 pack with my meal and just received 5 lol. Many times now I've not received dipping sauces that are advertised as part of a side or meal or drinks added to the order. I really don't care that much about sauce but after many separate orders missing small items and then just now missing a beer.. less than stellar experience. I recommend reviewing the process of packing orders. They definitely are not being double checked. The bag was open and 5 beers were in plain view on top."

Fox N Hound Neighbourhood Pub,American (Traditional),"720 Coverdale Road Riverview, NB E1B 3L4 Canada",NB,46.0595479,-64.817384,1,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of dining at a restaurant that left me utterly dissatisfied and questioning the meaning of ""value for money."" Let me save you the trouble and warn you to steer clear of this establishment, especially when it comes to their nachos. Prepare yourself for the shocking tale of my encounter with severely overpriced mediocrity.

Firstly, let's address the elephant in the room: the price. I was flabbergasted when the bill arrived, revealing a staggering $22 charge for a plate of nachos. Now, I understand that restaurants sometimes justify higher prices with superior quality or generous portions, but this case was far from it. I expected a nacho extravaganza, bursting with tantalizing toppings and an abundance of mouthwatering goodness. What I received instead was an insult to both my taste buds and my wallet.

Upon closer inspection, the nacho plate resembled a barren wasteland. The portion size was woefully inadequate, consisting of a mere eight frozen chicken cubes (yes, you read that right—frozen!) haphazardly scattered across a bed of tortilla chips. To add insult to injury, a meager sprinkling of cheese was carelessly melted over this sad excuse for a snack. I couldn't help but wonder if I had stumbled into a cheesy nightmare rather than a restaurant.

The chicken cubes themselves were lackluster, devoid of any flavor or seasoning. It was as if the cook had blindly thrown them on the plate straight from the freezer, without even a hint of effort or care. I'm left questioning why they bothered to include chicken at all if it was going to be this abysmal. It felt like a cheap ploy to justify the exorbitant price tag, preying on unsuspecting customers with inflated expectations.

Considering the lack of effort, creativity, and quality in these nachos, I can only conclude that the restaurant's management is either oblivious to the concept of customer satisfaction or shamelessly prioritizes profit margins above all else. It is simply unacceptable to charge such an exorbitant amount for a few frozen chicken cubes and a smattering of cheese on a bed of tortilla chips.

In conclusion, if you're searching for a culinary experience that delivers on taste, value, and customer satisfaction, I implore you to look elsewhere. The nachos at this restaurant are a classic case of highway robbery, leaving you with a bitter taste in your mouth and a lighter wallet. Save yourself the disappointment and seek out a dining establishment that respects their customers enough to provide a reasonable meal at a fair price."

Fox N Hound Neighbourhood Pub,American (Traditional),"720 Coverdale Road Riverview, NB E1B 3L4 Canada",NB,46.0595479,-64.817384,5,"I was a little skeptical of this place at first because it was hard to find and the side entrance through the mall wasn't the most inviting, however I was pleasantly surprised with the rest of the visit. The food was delicious, but even more so, the service and the staff were top notch. Tony and Melissa were both so friendly and accommodating and really made us feel welcome. We had 2 young children dining with us and they went above and beyond to make sure everyone was happy and comfortable. We will definitely be back!"
Red Satay Dieppe,Vietnamese,"790 Dieppe Boulevard Dieppe, NB E1A Canada",NB,46.0943368,-64.6933244,5,Quick and friendly service. As a Vietnamese person I think the taste is very good in terms of the way they season it and the way they make their fish sauce. Probably the best fish sauce I’ve had at any restaurant 🙂
Red Satay Dieppe,Vietnamese,"790 Dieppe Boulevard Dieppe, NB E1A Canada",NB,46.0943368,-64.6933244,5,"The food and staff here are amazing. If I could give it 6 stars, I would. Definitely my favourite restaurant.
Jenny's special is the best!"
Red Satay Dieppe,Vietnamese,"790 Dieppe Boulevard Dieppe, NB E1A Canada",NB,46.0943368,-64.6933244,3,"It's in a new building, very clean and fresh. It was easy to park and  the food came very fast. Good service very nice waitress we had.

The food is just ok. It's not what I expected. The portion is large.  I won't be going back for its taste. It's not authentic, therefore I couldn't find the justice of paying here more than other Vietnamese places which taste a lot better."
Red Satay Dieppe,Vietnamese,"790 Dieppe Boulevard Dieppe, NB E1A Canada",NB,46.0943368,-64.6933244,5,Tried Red Satay for the 1st time and I can't believe how long it's taken me to finally try it out! Tried the Red Satay Spicy Noodle Pho and it turns out when you order it for takeout they give you all the ingredients separated so you're able to assemble it yourself. This was actually a great idea and I was able to have 2 meals out of it. The broth was very tasty and spicy enough but not too much. The chicken was very tender and the spice on the side was a good touch. All the ingredients were fresh and you could really taste the quality. I will definitely return and try many other meals they offer. The only reason I give 4 stars for atmosphere is because it was very packed and loud inside so it would not be the place I would want go if I would want to have a quiet evening or conversation while dinning with someone.
Red Satay Dieppe,Vietnamese,"790 Dieppe Boulevard Dieppe, NB E1A Canada",NB,46.0943368,-64.6933244,5,"Best place for a wonton soup, reasonable price, big portion and service was excellent, not a place if you are in a rush tho as they were very busy when i was there."
Jitter Bean Cafe,Coffee & Tea,"1690 Mountain Road Unit 103 Moncton, NB E1G 1A5 Canada",NB,46.118839,-64.8434403,5,"A very cute cafe with many personal touches and attention to detail. This was my second time there and I absolutely loved it. Ordered the Breakfast Panini with egg as choice of protein and a cappuccino. The coffee was perfect and so was the Panini. Generously filled plate. Hard working staff, I believe it is a family run business. Keep up the great service!
My day is made! 😇"
Jitter Bean Cafe,Coffee & Tea,"1690 Mountain Road Unit 103 Moncton, NB E1G 1A5 Canada",NB,46.118839,-64.8434403,5,I was visiting Moncton so decided to stop by this cafe. I tried cappuccino and flat white with oat milk. Exceptionally cozy cafe with food items too on menu specifically korean. Loved the flat white and the lady was sweet as they don’t have flat white on the menu but made it for me. Will try other things next time I drop by! ;)
Jitter Bean Cafe,Coffee & Tea,"1690 Mountain Road Unit 103 Moncton, NB E1G 1A5 Canada",NB,46.118839,-64.8434403,5,"It's about time my lovely wife Pat and I went to this fine café. I had always mistakenly assumed it was a simple coffee shop (just going by the name). I was certainly wrong, it is so much more. It has a varied food selection and seem to be keyed more towards Korean food selection.
I noticed today's special was a very glamorous grilled cheese and the description made it sound extremely appetizing. Not ones normal, nor simple type of grilled cheese.
Although I was tempted, I stuck with my original reason for going here, to try their Korean meal selection.
At the counter I ordered their advertised (on the wall) BBW Pork consisting of BBQ Pork (of course), fried eggs, steamed rice and greens.
I was not sure what the greens were but found them delicious. Visually reminded me of mermaid tails, but very small.
Pat ordered the Japchae and mandoo dumplings (went with the beef and pork option). Her choice consisted of stir fried sweet potatoes vermicelli noodles. Once again, when eating out, Pat had enough left overs for her dinner later this day.
I completed the eating of my meal and felt very content afterwards.
Pat especially enjoyed her café latte. I truly enjoyed the freshly made strawberry smoothie. I had intended to go with their famous hot chocolate but the idea of a smoothie overtook me. Next time. We both look forward to returning. When I asked Pat what she thought of this place she stated, ""it's my new number one place"" 🙂
Update; we've both been back here a few times. Our only limitation are funds. We tend to plan outings a bit more budgeted. If money no object, this would be a regular stop. As it stands, we use this fine café as our reward system and star attraction for bringing loved ones to."
Jitter Bean Cafe,Coffee & Tea,"1690 Mountain Road Unit 103 Moncton, NB E1G 1A5 Canada",NB,46.118839,-64.8434403,5,We stopped in before our eye appointments for coffee. Ended up going back for lunch! Excellent food and service. Will certainly return next time we're in the area
Jitter Bean Cafe,Coffee & Tea,"1690 Mountain Road Unit 103 Moncton, NB E1G 1A5 Canada",NB,46.118839,-64.8434403,5,Definitely get the strawberry smoothie from here! The combination of flavors just hit the spot perfectly. The Beef bulgoli was incredible. I will come back some time to try more dishes!

The server was very attentive, checking on us lots of times, offering everything we needed. The sushi was good, not great but it was perfectly serviceable for a date night, portions were on the small side, but the prices were fair. The is better sushi in the city but not a nicer setting, and no better service. Will try again to find something we like a little more.  I wish we had more then 6 stars cause this restaurant is a 7/10, not a 3/5"

I'm told this was the first sushi place in Moncton and I see why they would still be in service this long.
The service was perfect and the staff was so friendly.
The decor was really nice and fun too. Love the indoor cherry tree!"

They took us in even if it was close to closing time. The waiter was attentive to our needs and the food was really good. The boat our sushi came in was very nice. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in Moncton."
Pink Sushi,Japanese,"720  Main Street Moncton, NB E1C 1E3 Canada",NB,46.0886899,-64.7761165,5,New favourite sushi place! Everything was amazing. We shared the medium roll tray and it was too much for 2! (But perfect for leftovers.) The service was amazing and I can't wait to go back! The Pink roll is incredible!
Pink Sushi,Japanese,"720  Main Street Moncton, NB E1C 1E3 Canada",NB,46.0886899,-64.7761165,5,I'm from out of town and my husband and I come to moncton for our anniversairy every year and this is the highlight of the trip for me.

Boston Pizza,Pizza,"1380 Mountain Road Moncton, NB E1C 2T8 Canada",NB,46.1088539,-64.8315362,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at a Boston Pizza and I must say, it was an exceptional experience. I opted for the slow roasted pork back ribs with bourbon BBQ sauce, and it was a delightful choice. The dish came with two sides - garlic mashed potatoes and Caesar salad - and a sumptuous bread slice. The garlic mashed potatoes were heavenly and melted in my mouth, while the ribs were divine, soft and delicious.

What impressed me the most was the speed at which my meal was served, and the great service that accompanied it. The staff were courteous and attentive from the moment I walked in the door to my table. The server was knowledgeable about the menu and took the time to explain each dish in detail. Additionally, the restaurant was very giving in their service, going above and beyond to ensure that my dining experience was top-notch.

The ambiance of the restaurant was also inviting and cozy, the choice of music was created the perfect atmosphere for a pleasant dining experience. The attention to detail in every aspect of the restaurant was impressive and it was evident that the staff takes pride in their work.

Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great dining experience. From the sumptuous dishes, to the outstanding service, everything was exceptional. I am already looking forward to my next visit!"
Boston Pizza,Pizza,"1380 Mountain Road Moncton, NB E1C 2T8 Canada",NB,46.1088539,-64.8315362,5,"We went to Boston Pizza in Moncton for Valentines day and thought maybe we should make reservations.  I'm glad we did since we went around supper time and there was already a lineup. The wait was short, less than 5 mins even though we were about 10 mins late for our reservation. I had requested a window booth as I usually do, and they accommodated us, by putting us on the bar side. I assume the restaurant side is quieter, but we enjoyed the good music and the TV entertainment while we waited for our meal. The service was excellent. Our waitress Kelsey was attentive, especially for a very busy night. She was the only server I ever met who automatically brought me a fresh pop before I even ran out!  How did she know I was a pop a holic ! Lol
My Fiancée ordered the pasta dish with alfredo sauce, spinach and mini tomorrow, as we went for the pasta Tuesday specials, and I got the Hungry Carinvore dish as I am far from a vegetarian. That was ALOT of food, I am not usually full with just one dish, but this meal was loaded with meat.. Huge meatballs cut in half,  as well as other meats,in penne pasta. We were going to get their delicious chocolate dessert, which I have had before, but we decided to get the small heart shaped pizza with chicken and pinaples instead , it was delicious, and I have always loved Boston Pizzas thick hard crust, it was more than enough food so we took some home. Overall it was a great experience,  the table was clean, the food arrived fast and hot, perfectly cooked, I would highly recommend."

Boston Pizza,Pizza,"1380 Mountain Road Moncton, NB E1C 2T8 Canada",NB,46.1088539,-64.8315362,1,"First time at Moncton Boston but probably the worst beer ever had, (the entire pitcher).When asked about a different brand, said we have to pay for the two glasses of those FLAT beer because we had had “few sips”which was super weird!!
Surprisingly even the staff mentioned, might be bottom of batch!
Paid the bill and left but a wonderful night ruined very well, so I wouldn’t recommend their Moncton bar altho I’ve had great experiences from their other locations."

Pretty good not bad for the price. 😉 under $11.00  for a 2 piece.
Wouldn't be able to eat any more than what they have given me, was plenty.
Wasn't very busy for the time that I have arrived. (sevenish) as you can see in the photo below.
Dinning area was open, clean, spacious and friendly staff. I'm not much of a fast food kinda man but would go back again and order something different on the menu. 🤔
Would I recommend Deluxe, sure why not.
So far so good."

Bravo Pizza,Pizza,"567 Coverdale Road Riverview, NB E1B 3K7 Canada",NB,46.0632826,-64.809984,2,The pizza was a disappointment. The crust was heavy and hard as rock. The lasagna was bland and had no meat but we didnt order the vegetarian so not sure what happened there. Pics can be deceiving!

Location is a pain, since you need to find paid parking in downtown Moncton. Which is no easy task. Try the wraps!"
Freshii,Salad,"200 Ivan Rand E Suite 3 Moncton, NB E1C 0V9 Canada",NB,46.0836153,-64.7898229,3,"Food is good but the service is seriously lacking. I've been here several times this year and have mostly been happy with the food. The ingredients really are good and fresh. I know staffing has been hard but last month I waited while two staff members started to make a wrap, then throw out perfectly good ingredients and then started again. It ended up tasting okay but it was wrapped terribly and fell apart right away. It was hard to watch them struggle while I stood there waiting. I'd think that they would have received the proper training on how to finish rolling a wrap. I ate there tonight and said hi to the staff member when I walked in and he ignored me and pointed to a tablet placed on the counter. I looked and there was a man on video on the tablet and the guy in the store told me to order through him. It's difficult to hear him as the music is loud in the restaurant and I had to ask him to repeat himself multiple times. I had to order and pay through the man on the tablet while the staff member just stood there waiting. I do no get this change. It seems detached, impersonal, awkward, and unprofessional. I spoke to the owner in the spring and he said he always wants to hear constructive criticism so hopefully he is checking these reviews. I don't think I'll be coming back if this is the new standard of customer service. Why are we outsourcing an order entry system when there is a perfectly capable employee literally standing right in front of the customer? I usually leave a generous tip but was just so thrown off by this awkward interaction that I skipped tipping tonight. If I could separate my rating I'd give the food a 5 and customer service a 2."
Freshii,Salad,"200 Ivan Rand E Suite 3 Moncton, NB E1C 0V9 Canada",NB,46.0836153,-64.7898229,1,Very disappointed. I paid 11$ for a bowl which was half empty. Been to many other Freshii’s around Canada and i have never been shorted so much product.

My daughter and I sampled together and both concurred it is the best shawarma yet, in Moncton."

Greco Pizza,Pizza,"448 Elmwood Drive Moncton, NB E1A 2X3 Canada",NB,46.1173594,-64.7726353,1,"Review is only on pizza. Poor. Dough is undercooked and slices are soggy instead of crispy. Crusts are bready. Being from ny, a large pie is 18"", but here it's 15"". Cheese was browned on top which I didn't care for. I got the donair pie, which seemed cheap on meat. Onions are not caramelized. Raw diced tomatoes were tossed in the middle of the pie after it was cooked. Maybe it's bc I'm from ny and used to great pizza, but I've had dollar slices that were better than this."

Anyway.  The food was just as bad as the first order we complained about.  Soggy, lack of toppings and just greasy cheese.  We tossed it.  Save your money and go to better pizza places in Dieppe/Moncton.  Believe it or not.  These were small pizzas thin crust.  Haha.  Why would I need two (garlic breads) thinking that is what they were.   The toppings are soooo small and lacking, its just beyond a joke."

Also, don't order their donairs and expect an actual donair. it's very cheap and bland meat on a pizza crust that they cook, its way too thick and not even a donair? gross."

Asian Garden Indian Restaurant,Indian,"25 Killam Drive Moncton, NB E1C 3R1 Canada",NB,46.1003114,-64.8126722,1,"I travelled halfway across Canada to eat this trash...
As I was strolling through town, I looked upon this restaurant to find some classic Indian food. However, I can inform you that this is not an Asian garden but an overly priced piece of trash.
Even my grandma said it’s trash.
After my first bite, I immediately dumped my whole meal down my sink.
Unfortunately, the sink clogged.
I rate this place a -2/10.
UPDATE: My plumber charged me extra to fix the sink😲"
Asian Garden Indian Restaurant,Indian,"25 Killam Drive Moncton, NB E1C 3R1 Canada",NB,46.1003114,-64.8126722,1,"Worst indian food ever in Canada. Service was pathetic. The server did not even know half the things on the menu. Waited for an hour for our order even when we(a group of 5 people) were the only one's in the restaurant. Most of what we ordered did not even go through and the server was not even bothered to inform us about it as she assumed that we would like to cancel our order. Lol. We were overcharged. If we hadnt bothered to take a look at our bill we would blindly pay what was told to us. The owner of the restaurant acted as if she does not care and tells us that the food in Moncton is suppose to be this way. Haha. Really??  The Madras curry tasted like it only had boiled chicken and tomatoe puree. No curry leaves, no mustard seeds nothing. Please do not go to this restaurant unless you have an entire day to waste or if you really want to try some tasteless and horrible indian food."
Asian Garden Indian Restaurant,Indian,"25 Killam Drive Moncton, NB E1C 3R1 Canada",NB,46.1003114,-64.8126722,1,"So me and my family visiting NB from AB and wife craved some Indian food and this was the only place open at the time. For starters I couldn’t find this place, my GPS told its in isolated barn looking building without any signage, secondly food is way over priced and taste nothing like its suppose to. Dal Makhani have wrong lentils used, how stupid you have to be to use wrong main ingredient and don’t tell your customer, Chicken Tikka Masala was sweeter than candy, absolute shame who ever cooked this that the owners are letting this person burn this place down. Finally the naan bread, wife asked for butter naan, naans were hard as popadum and no butter, if you don’t do butter naan tell your customers, don’t just keep taking orders like a trainee. The only thing positive was the food was still piping hot when we opened it up after bringing to the hotel room.
Friendly warning: save your money don’t eat here, eat a left over McDonald and you’d be less disappointed"
Asian Garden Indian Restaurant,Indian,"25 Killam Drive Moncton, NB E1C 3R1 Canada",NB,46.1003114,-64.8126722,1,"I would say this is the perfect place to waste your time and money. Highly recommended if you love tomato based curries. My 18 year brother can cook better than what I had here last night. So called madras curry which had no curry leaves no mustard seeds and coconut milk. That curry should be named as tomato chicken and not the madras chicken.
Owner of the restaurant is money oriented and not the customer oriented thats for sure.
Thanks a lot for ruining our day. Cheers !!"
Asian Garden Indian Restaurant,Indian,"25 Killam Drive Moncton, NB E1C 3R1 Canada",NB,46.1003114,-64.8126722,1,"Absolutely worst customer service and horrible food. I guess they do not have enough workers to give the customer service as expected. Just one lady who was handling the take away and the serving. And made us wait for an hour for just the starters. And then the main course(OMG) absolutely a nightmare. The curries were all cooked in the same tomato curry and were soury but no taste at all. Then we asked for a starter and we were served a curry instead. Like come on guys!!!! And then what we ordered was noteven served to us properly. At the end when went to pay the bill, we were given the total more than what we were supposed to. The other worst thing that they do not have a POS , they just write down all the items on paper and give you. When all these things were explained to the lady owner there, she was not apologetic at all and was showing attitude to us. And was like this is how it is supposed to be. No way guys I do not think Moncton people are supposed to be served with all curries made in same tomato purie..so in the end guys please go there only if you want to waste a whole lot of your time for tasteless food and horrible customer service..."

When I first started eating here, the donair was great (see in picture) but the last visits the donair had very little donair meat (mostly crust). Unfortunately i didn't get a photo. I'll give it a try again before I make a final decision. Everyone has bad days...maybe that was one, or two for them."

Husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs, was given lasagna and then told that's how they make spaghetti.... it was watey and bland.  Neither of us wanted to eat another bite.
The waitress was kind, offered us something else, however, with 2 awful meals already, we didn't want to chance trying a third and forth meal and wasting their time.  We left and ate elsewhere.
I bet the pizza is alright, but I would never go here again, and I don't ever wrote reviews, or complain much, I'm not a picky eater... this was just an awful experience.. I would do not recommend."

Pizza Delight,Pizza,"188 Mountain Road Moncton, NB E1C 2L4 Canada",NB,46.0946401,-64.7833985,1,"so this one merits a bit of a story: after the mid-day waitress leaves to the casual aloofness of the other's inattentive knowledge of anything on the menu, and my own inattention to the extra 60 cents upon paying la facture, the manager of the day and I were embroiled in a classic duel of western proportions, me slinging my five, her slinging the change. To which I nervously blurted ""ok, I set the terms - you put the change on the table at the same time I put the dollar bill"" clearly unpleased with this negotiation tactic, she attempted a swipe at my handed five, but on that day my senses were as sharp as my grip and so my next counter was: ""I'm gonna count to 5 and place the dollar bill on the table, I suggested you do the same with your $4.70"" After a couple tumultuous hesitations, we arrived at an acceptable exchange of loots. Thou the manager of the day was clearly still unsatisfied and asserted that my mother and I were not to return to their store. I wasn't sure whether any of this was in seriousness as her authority wasn't the kind of thing I was accustomed to during the Pizza Delight lunch specials. The garlic fingers were very good so I'm going to give them a benefit of doubt and mark this down as a five star experience."

First, let me start with the food – it is absolutely delectable! The burgers, fries and onion rings are cooked to perfection and are mouth-watering, delicious and satisfying. Every bite is full of flavour, to say the least, i was impressed by the quality of the food

In addition to the food, the service is extraordinary. The staff members are friendly, prompt and accommodating, and they consistently go above and beyond to ensure that every customer feels welcomed and valued.

The best part about visiting here is the cozy and welcoming environment. The restaurant is spotlessly clean, and the decor is modern and comfortable, making it a perfect place to meet with family and friends.

Overall, my experience was nothing less than fantastic. The food, service and ambiance are all top-notch, and I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for a great meal with exceptional service. It’s no surprise that this location has so many positive reviews because it’s simply the best. Thank you for the wonderful experience!"

Pizza was great.
Wings were delivered completely burned, dried out, and inedible. I ordered 16, and they loaded the box with a heap of over 20 burned wings with a slather of bbq sauce in an attempt to cover them up. I’ve never seen such disgusting wings in my life. Called and spoke to the supervisor, who made no effort to improve the quality of their food. Basically discouraged me from ordering them, by telling me even he doesn’t order the wings from there, because that’s just the way they are. So disappointing! What kind of employee thought these looked appetizing?! Was given a “quality guarantee credit” towards a pizza on my next order. Don’t order their wings."

And 2nd when you order online and get there pizza and garlic finger ""cheese sticks"" deal there's no way to add bacon to the purchase.

The delivery driver did not knock on the door and left our food on the doorstep in the snow. We know he didn’t knock because the dogs did not bark. We were in the next room continuously looking out for a driver and never heard anything.
When I called to speak to someone about it I got the driver who told me I was wrong and proceeded to put me on hold three times. When I finally spoke to the leader on duty she also told me I was wrong and she “knows the driver and he would have knocked” and basically told me I was wrong despite not being there to witness his actions. There was no attempt to acknowledge the issue or even an “I’m sorry that happened but he knocked” just “no, I know he knocked”. They then put me on hold and hung up the phone shortly after.  Terrible service, not worth your time or money."
Papa Johns Pizza,Pizza,"639 Mountain Road Riverview, NB E1B 5J9 Canada",NB,46.0525806,-64.7944973,1,"Moved to RiverView from British Columbia in recent Months. I work from home an normally necer have problems with orders, but recently this store has performed terribly.

I ordered a Large Cheese, Extra Cheese, Light Sause with Square Cut and Well Done.

Receieved a Large Cheese, Extra Cheese, Extra Sauce, Normal Cut, Normal Cook.

That isn't all. Covid is still a thing an the box was not sealed with a sticker to indicate it wasn't opened by anyone after baking. So I was hesitant to actually touch it.

So I called to get it corrected, as with prior stores in BC and their regulations are. If the pizza is wrong, it will be remade an replaced, usually having the pizza made taken back or given out for free with the error.

I was told.

""Sorry, but if you order from us again. Call the store next time and we will make it the way you want it. I made that Pizza myself, so I don't see what the problem is,  but if you wanted Extra Sauce just call.""

I shouldn't have to order online or go into a store to order a pizza or any other food, and then have to go home only to realize the order that I ordered was not the order that I ordered, and then have to call in to be told oh well you should have called us while they were making it.

Reccomend avoiding Papajohns. All together in this province with the ""Quality"" they continue to show."

One of the staff that was always on the frier I haven't seen, that may have been the change. The fish and fries are always not cooked. The batter is crispy on the outside but slimy raw inside and the fish is uncooked. Same thing for the fries but not crispy at all. This is the fourth time and I've given up on bringing it back, I thought they were just having off days. It's too bad because they used to be amazing."

He refused to take my order even though the usual lady is ok in preparing the plates a bit in advance (since there's only street parking). Not really a place to dine in cuz the tables are quite small. Place could definitely use some improvements and be more clean."
Marché Méli-Mélo,Haitian,"640 Rue Jarry E Montreal, QC H2P 1V7 Canada",QC,45.5447239,-73.6276151,1,"I visited this Haitian restaurant in Montreal several years ago, thanks to a recommendation from a dear friend. Back then, my experience was fantastic. The service was satisfactory, the portions were generous, and the food itself was incredibly tasty. I often made it a point to stop by this place before heading back to my town.

However, over the past 5 to 6 years, I've observed some noticeable changes in the level of customer service and the overall layout of the restaurant. It seems that the owners have missed an opportunity to enhance their profits by not considering the logistical aspects of the establishment. There's room for improvement in this regard.

One of the major changes I noticed is the declining level of customer service. The staff appears to lack the same level of care and dedication they once had. During a recent visit, I brought some friends to experience the authentic Haitian cuisine. Unfortunately, I encountered an unpleasant situation when I had to return to the front cashier to make a change to my order, despite clearly specifying my desired rice type. The staff in the kitchen were rude and insisted that it wasn't on the receipt, instructing me to go back to the front to pay for it. This encounter left a sour taste in my mouth.

Furthermore, upon reaching home and indulging in my meal, I noticed a decline in the quality of the food, particularly the beef. As a lover of the “Legume”, I've been consistently disappointed by the dish at this restaurant in recent times.

I truly hope the owners take note of these customer concerns and consider making changes to enhance the overall experience. It would be wonderful if they paid attention to reviews like these. I believe there are customers like myself who long for a return to the delicious food and enjoyable dining experience that this restaurant once offered."

Meli-Melos food was beyond delicious, stuffed to the brim to make sure your stomach is full, and everything i wanted + more. The kind woman working the register let me practice my French with her, and made me feel right at home in a city I've never been to. Highly recommended, across the board."

As some other previous comments the customer service is seriously lacking. I don’t know Haitian cuisine so I was asking the cashier what the dishes are and the whole time I felt like I was bothering her. She told me “beef Tasso” was “Griot” but with beef, and didn’t even bother explaining the different sizes. I don’t even know if it’s true but what I ate today was nothing like the griot I had before. A few slices of an extremely dry meat, I couldn’t even finish the dish, and to top it all I paid 27.50$ for that plate + an accra (Aran kind of who she said was 5$! For a single accra!). Very disappointed."

Also very close to the metro for those of you who don’t drive (metro cote vertu). I also always get their dak galbi stew (spicy chicken. Stew with rice) so good!! Must try!!!

Ramen noodles  9/10    good broth and flavor

Very good fried chicken. Not many places offer wings, most offer half or whole chicken.   Bi bim bap was very good.    The noodles and kim chi were ok. The is the only place in Montréal/ Toronto that has pork bone  soup, bi bim bap and fried chicken.  Very good prices.   The food is timed and comes out at the same time (most of the time)"
Bol Orange,Korean,"983 Boulevard Décarie Montreal, QC H4L 3M6 Canada",QC,45.514161,-73.6822895,3,"SERVICE: Came here when they first opened, food is always good. Went back a couple of times recently, the person that works in the front is a bit slow, we had to ask for cultery, dishes, napkins. When we were ready to leave, which we waiting 20minutes to have the bill, we asked and the person went back to clean some spoons, or going into the back doing God knows what. Asked a second time and still proceeds on doing something else so we finally walked to the front and asked the owner to have the bill. As for the service, I’d give 3/5. The waiter would leave tables dirty and not clean up the table until there is a line up. Not very efficient.

FOOD: love their spicy tuna kimbap, chiken cutlet is very good but the chiken is always over-fried, as it was super hard to chew and burnt.

We love coming to this place but for sure has some adjustments to make."

Decor, layout and music was great! Food was delicious! Service was impeccable!

✨More elaborate review✨
Firstly, when we walked in we were so happy with the ambience/atmosphere of this restaurant; the decor, music and layout were lovely!

Second, this was our first time trying Russian cuisine and I personally wasn’t sure about what I was reading about on the menu. After ordering, I realized they have pictures of all their meals on their website in the gallery section! I highly recommend to go take a look if you also are unfamiliar with Russian cuisine!

Furthermore, I am so pleased to say that the food was DELICIOUS. Generous portions, flavourful and truly satisfying. Plus, the bread, butter and sour cream were all homemade. (I’m sure more was homemade but this is what we specifically found out was homemade!) I’ll post photos of what my husband and I got for reference!

Third, the lady who served us, I wish I had asked her her name, was so warm, kind, generous, helpful and pleasant! She is a gem and 100% added to the amazing experience we had. Such attention to detail and care!

All in all, please go check this restaurant out! It is worth it!

Service is Top Shelf!!
Portions are very generous!
Baton Rouge has a rather unique system whereby the wait staff are constantly attempting to be aware of each others tables.  What this means for the customer is Fast Efficient Service.  If your meal is 'up' in the kitchen, and your server is not there, but another is -- that server will bring it out to you.  Simple things like water refills and clearing dishes is rarely missed.
For starters we had the Calamari.  it was cooked to perfection, tender and crispy on the outside, served with Smoke Show Aioli. The Seared Ahi Tuna Salad (the tuna was 'melt-in-your-mouth' delectable)
The New York Strip Loin** ordered Rare was incredible!.
We also went 'overboard' by adding a side of Sizzling Shrimp and Scallops.
**The waitress (Maria) was quick to ask if I wanted the steak off the regular menu - or the special (upgrade that came with starter salad, and the steak was topped with a generous slice of Brie and Pan Seared Mushrooms and accompanied with Green Beans and choice of second side).**
Our meal was capped off with the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake to share.
The prices are quite fair, considering the exceptional service, and generous portions!  It seems rare that you can find a restaurant where the entire waitstaff seem happy to serve, are very friendly and efficient in their work!"

However what was more displeasing was the tteobeokki that was in a large container and barely filled 1/4 of the container.. barely had any spicy sauce inside the container along with the rice cake, to top it off, there was a piece of paper inside the container stuck on the food... wasted quite a large amount (for the total amount) for such little quantity which was also disappointing based on its quality. Wouldn't recommend ordering gimbap and tteobeokki, however I don't know how their other dishes taste like, so I will not comment on them."
Joséphine,Seafood,"4007 Rue Saint-Denis Montreal, QC H2W 2M4 Canada",QC,45.5208464,-73.5755691,5,"A small group of four, we shared the shrimp cocktail, had lobster risotto and the sea bass for two dinner.  The shrimp was tasty, sweet and completed by fresh horseradish and cocktail sauce.  The sea bass was wonderful, perfectly crisp, light and flaky in a tray bean gravy with thin roasted fennel bulb and crispy shoe string potatoes. We were a hungry group so everyone enjoyed their dishes that night, yet all felt the same the next day.  😊

In addition our server was wonderful and had great stories to share on the history of Montreal and the changes happening in the Latin quarter today."
Joséphine,Seafood,"4007 Rue Saint-Denis Montreal, QC H2W 2M4 Canada",QC,45.5208464,-73.5755691,4,"Enjoyed the food but wish we would have tried some different dishes. We had the catch of the day and the mussels, which were both tasty but nothing to rave about when it came to the flavour. The service was great and the restaurant has a fun vibe. Would definitely come back to try something else!"
Joséphine,Seafood,"4007 Rue Saint-Denis Montreal, QC H2W 2M4 Canada",QC,45.5208464,-73.5755691,2,"Restaurant we booked shut down due to an electricity issues so we stumble upon Josephine impromptu. I have to say our experience was not the best despite the high pricetag of the restaurant. To start off as I was tasting the wine I had to select from a mini wine list, I mentioned that the temperature of the wine was not adequate and the waiter proceeded to convince me that my mouth was probably detecting the wrong temperature cos he ""touched"" the bottle and it was ok.
The service was very slow, slow to take orders, slow for food to come, slow to check back, slow to get the check and slow to pay.

Had the oysters and mignonette as a starter and they were good.  The main was the octopus and really the dish was problematic. The octopus itself was chewy, tasteless, if not for a strong artificial smoke taste.  It came with a caponata that had never heard of Sicily and a tasteless artichaud puree.

Other guests had:

- The Cesar salad that was good and the salmon tartar that was average.

- The mussels were  hard as stone (not sure how that is possible, may be they were recooked) and not enjoyable to eat."
Joséphine,Seafood,"4007 Rue Saint-Denis Montreal, QC H2W 2M4 Canada",QC,45.5208464,-73.5755691,5,"Highly recommend this restaurant. The food is wonderful and the space is bright and decorated beautifully.

We loved the grilled oyster mushrooms--so good! Both the lobster risotto and the moules frites were amazing. Nothing but praises for this menu."
Joséphine,Seafood,"4007 Rue Saint-Denis Montreal, QC H2W 2M4 Canada",QC,45.5208464,-73.5755691,2,"Was really looking forward to a fine dining seafood restaurant experience. Instead was extremely disappointed in the food. , service and atmosphere. The server did not explain the dishes as they were served on your plate. The arctic char was a very small thin piece of dried out fish served with eggplant. She told us it was a large portion served with bok choy and potatoes. The wine by the glass was only 3 choices of very cheap quality white wine that did not go with the food at all. The music in the background was annoying and the entire atmosphere of the restaurant is unattractive and loud. It was also very pricey for that quality of food. I don’t usually give reviews but this one was necessary so as to let people know what to expect for their time and money."
Chez Wafi,Lebanese,"597 Boulevard Côte Vertu Saint-Laurent, QC H4L Canada",QC,45.522665,-73.673327,5,"Very delicious food. The staff is super hospitable and welcoming.
The taste of the Kaak itself is amazing, as if I am taking a bite from home. (Very close taste to Kaak Abu Arab in Lebanon!)

By far, the Farfelu Kaakeh (3 cheese - Mozzarella, Akawi, Halloumi) is their signature Kaakeh. It is a MUST try.

I also ordered the Basterma & Cheese, as well as the Turkey and Cheese, very good taste, and the portions are big enough. If you are not a heavy Kaakeh eater, 1 Kaakeh is more than enough.

Prices are crazy good, compared to the size of the portion and ingredients the price is very acceptable.

Chez Wafi, chapeau bas, my expectations have been exceeded. Will I visit again, you bet I will.

10/10 Service.
10/10 Food.
10/10 Pricing."

Food taste is average, not impressed.
They were not honest as they overcharged me way more than the published price.
Unfortunately, I figured out after I left the place, first and last visit.
My advice is to be careful when you pay if you want to go"

La Bêtise,Tapas Bars,"6015 Saint-Hubert Montreal, QC H2S 2L8 Canada",QC,45.5346727,-73.5993408,4,"I would try this place again.

I've only tried this location, so I will comment this location alone. They have 2 other locations.
Very nice staff.
The drinks were good.
They have a big selection of wines and a pretty big menu for cocktails aswell

This is a tapas restaurant so for those that like sharing it's perfect because the portions are not huge. It's perfect to get a few different things and share in between.

We got the oysters, the tuna tataki,the crab bites and also the salmon tartare. All of those were good. The only disappointment that I had was more of the tartare, I feel like the amount of salmon in the tartare was not enough and there were more of the other ingredients then the salmon in the tartare.(like tomato that looks like tartare but it's actually tomato).

Prices are not that expensive compared to other tapas restaurant in MTL

I definitely recommend this place, it's nice for a date night or to catch up with a friend. This location wasn't big."
La Bêtise,Tapas Bars,"6015 Saint-Hubert Montreal, QC H2S 2L8 Canada",QC,45.5346727,-73.5993408,4,The oysters and the sangria are delicious! One of the best sangrias I’ve ever had. But there’s no air conditioner and it gets very hot.  The fried calamari 👎
La Bêtise,Tapas Bars,"6015 Saint-Hubert Montreal, QC H2S 2L8 Canada",QC,45.5346727,-73.5993408,5,"Great place to go eat and drink! The asian fusion food is excellent. I was surprised that the poutine bibimbap tasted that good. The flavours blended well. The tuna tataki was amazing and calamari was good. The service is great as well but my only thing that I would neatpick would be the decor that needs a bit more love but besides that, very good place to come and eat with some friends!"
La Bêtise,Tapas Bars,"6015 Saint-Hubert Montreal, QC H2S 2L8 Canada",QC,45.5346727,-73.5993408,4,"Nice restaurant with a budget friendly menu.
Music and ambiance was nice and welcoming.
The oysters were really good.
My friend ordered crab bites, those were very good as well.
There was a dish I chose that wasn't really to my liking and the waitress immediately spoke with management and offered to replace it with something else from the menu. She suggested two that were her faves and I ended up with the Tuna Tataki. It did not disappoint. Excellent dish, right down to the details on the plate.
We also ordered a mocktail of one of their drinks and it was so refreshing.
Would definetly recommend this spot."
La Bêtise,Tapas Bars,"6015 Saint-Hubert Montreal, QC H2S 2L8 Canada",QC,45.5346727,-73.5993408,5,"Been wanting to go to la Bêtise for a long time and finallyhad the occasion to try.
They offered a special menu since it was their anniversary and we got to try their shrimp pasta with lobster bisque sauce.. If only it was on their menu all year long because it was EXCELLENT!
The truffle oil fries are a must! Lightly salted with a not too overpowering taste of truffle oil served with some kind of spicy mayo sauce.. Addicting!
Don't forget their 2$ oysters.. Had to order 2 platters, one as an appetizer and another for dessert."

I had the sliders and the spinach dip. The sliders were good, but I would have preferred it with some tomatoes and maybe a bit more cheese.
The spinach dip was delicious but the chips were just ordinary.
The waitress was extremely nice. Personally, I thought the service was great. I would definitely come back."

Inside has more a bar/supper club vibe. Music was nice but at certain times super loud. Will definitely try to sit outside next time.
Food:
We ordered two appetizers the cheese platter and gnocchi. Both were good, good size and nice presentation
For the main, we ordered the ravioli with lobster and mushrooms. Really good. A bit on the salty side but loved it.
The grilled octopus was also delicious
Dessert:
We just had the churros as the creme brûlée had whiskey in it and thought it could be sour.
Overall nice experience and will definitely come back"

The oysters were so fresh and massive, we ordered multiple different plates and everything was good. The waitress was very friendly and our drinks were always kept full. I am removing a star because there were a lot of young staff standing by the kitchen hugging and touching each other and it was so unprofessional to have that right by our table all night."

They were mainly good, drinks r good but a little expensive.  Food was perfect, price is with the market but service was not there..
no one came back to ask if it was ok. The two staffs were probably new, and they were always talking in the corner.

The good food kept the restaurant at 4/5 stars."

Having been there more than a dozen times over the last few years, July 2023 we jad the gnocchis which were utterly dissapointing, cocktails were watery... first time dissapointed at le Boating.

They need to have more bars in this place. You're gonna wait over 5 mins (sounds like nothing until you're actually waiting) just to get a drink.

And the drinks aren't consistent. They're stronger towards the end of the night. Probably their way of getting people out faster."

Restaurant Calvi,Italian,"2940 Ave Pierre-Péladeau Laval, QC H7T 3B3 Canada",QC,45.56312,-73.744751,2,"This place is okay, but it's not authentic.

The octopus was really good, but very small portion.
The calamari was okay, nothing special, there was no tentacles.

The truffle pasta was okay also and the risotto dish came with a big piece of Osso bucco, was not expecting to have a big piece of Osso bucco, I thought it would be bone off.

But I can say that the creme brulee was really good

The service was actually amazing, the waiter was really friendly.

I had ordered an espresso martini with my dessert but they had forgotten to put khalua in it and it taste horrible, when I told the waiter about it he was doubting me on why I wanted to return the drink back but then he realized that it was the khalua that was missing in the drink, he brought me khalua in a glass so I can mix it in my drink.

This place seemed to be more of a place for groups, they had private rooms. If you are celebrating a birthday party or a big get together in Laval with Italian type of food, I think it's a good choice."

Caesar salad was made with green lettuce instead of romaine.  Became very soggy. Plates did not look nice.   Steak was very hard to chew.  Where was the veggies in the shrimp and veggies dish? Cold and tough shrimp.  And the ravioli was just ok.    I expected so much more from this restaurant. I was not impressed at all. Did not finish plates.  Sprinkling tomatoes does not make a plate look nice.."

However, he didn’t seems to happy, since we were with 2 kids. Therefore, he gave us a table in an isolated room, where it was very hot. As soon as we wanted to sit, he even closed the door.  It was 42 degrees Celsius outside. I asked him “is the air conditioning working in that room, he told me yes”. Which was not true. Therefore we decided to leave and we came to Sterling Steakhouse right next door. They were very nice and accommodating and helpful with the kids.

As a matter of fact, she patiently explained any questions we have. On top of it, she even recommended a few drinks to us, which makes the experience even better.
As for food, the flavor is really great, and I order a beef tartar to start. As for entree, I order a halibut.  The dish is very well seasoned. the only minor downside is that the halibut is a little blend.  But overall, the whole dining experience is very good."
Bistro St-Malo,Bistros,"75 Rue Saint-Paul Quebec City, QC G1K 3V8 Canada",QC,46.816226,-71.2040469,5,"We LOVED it here. Our server was AMAZING, despite a language gap. She was attentive and very kind. Her name was Andrea, I believe. The food was so so good. Every member of my party of 5 adored their meal. Very expensive but extremely worth it compared with other places I’ve been in Quebec City."
Bistro St-Malo,Bistros,"75 Rue Saint-Paul Quebec City, QC G1K 3V8 Canada",QC,46.816226,-71.2040469,5,"We had an awesome experience and can’t say enough about how great our server, Andrea was.  She made excellent recommendations and was so kind.  The atmosphere was awesome - we felt like we had our own little area, even in a full restaurant.
We enjoyed the cassoulet and the pork Osso bucco with orzo.  The carrot soup was also very good and our dessert—apple, pastry, and ice cream—was delicious.
We would have eaten in more of the bistros and cafes in this part of town had we found them earlier."
Bistro St-Malo,Bistros,"75 Rue Saint-Paul Quebec City, QC G1K 3V8 Canada",QC,46.816226,-71.2040469,5,"By far our favorite meal during our week in Old Quebec. From our waitress, Jennifer, being an absolute pleasure, to the owner and chef greeting us with drinks after dinner, everything was perfect. Highly recommend the French onion soup, the cod with gnocchi, and the rabbit dish. Also, the tarte tatin for dessert wil blow you away! We can't wait for our next trip to come back for more!"
Bistro St-Malo,Bistros,"75 Rue Saint-Paul Quebec City, QC G1K 3V8 Canada",QC,46.816226,-71.2040469,5,"Great quality food. Incredible service and lovely environment.
Had the French Onion Soup with Foei Gras, first time trying it in my life. The Foei  Gras was unique, it tasted not as I expected. It had a buttery texture and taste, just being a bit harder and grainer than normal butter, and had a bitter-liverlike after taste. The French Onion Soup was good but not too outstanding.Then ordered the Rabit leg white wine risoto for the main course. Easily one of the best food i ever had in my life. The rabbit leg was simple and not too dry, the risoto rice was perfectly creamy. Friend ordered the steak and frites and it was the best steak i everhad. The fries had depth of flavour, with it being fried mostlikely in animal fat rather than the usual american way in oil. The steak simply made me speechless. The first bite made me explode in my mind."
Buvette Scott,Canadian (New),"821 Rue Scott Quebec City, QC G1R 3C8 Canada",QC,46.80926,-71.2211781,5,Quaint little restaurant with exceptional dishes and cocktails/wine. We sat at the bar and had a lot of fun watching the food and drinks being made to perfection. Nice vibe and knowledgeable staff.
Buvette Scott,Canadian (New),"821 Rue Scott Quebec City, QC G1R 3C8 Canada",QC,46.80926,-71.2211781,5,"We had such a delicious and convivial experience at Buvette Scott; it would be a must for a return trip to the city.

I loved its unassuming and neighborhood atmosphere. The service was stellar, and the food was local and delicious. The limited menu serves the small space well, and allows for excellent execution.

The duck ham is exceptional. Oysters were perfect and came with a homemade vinegar that is one of the best oyster accompaniments I’ve had anywhere. The beef tongue dish made me smile- tasty and right up my alley with the pairing of escarole, and zesty sauce, and pickled mustard seeds.

I was so pleased to be enthusiastically offered really great nonalcoholic pairings. The Mikkeller Riesling beer and a local cider were refreshing and clean-flavored (often nonalcoholic offerings don’t pair well with food! Great choices.)

Our server was so genuine and kind, a true Québécois."
Buvette Scott,Canadian (New),"821 Rue Scott Quebec City, QC G1R 3C8 Canada",QC,46.80926,-71.2211781,5,"This place is amazing! We went last night for early dinner. It was the best time. One of the owners served us and he was tres charmant, made the best recommendations.

We had oysters to start, so fresh! He suggested the white wine from Loire which tasted like candy after the oysters - the perfect pair! It went nicely with the rest of our meal: char with leeks (sooo buttery), beets, and chicken with morels to finish. Everything was perfectly executed. We had to have a second round of oysters for dessert.

Service had personal touches and expert explanations for each dish. You can tell, this is a place where passion and professionalism marriage perfectly. Seasonal and local menu, which is our favourite kind.

Thank you for perfection! See you again soon :)"
Buvette Scott,Canadian (New),"821 Rue Scott Quebec City, QC G1R 3C8 Canada",QC,46.80926,-71.2211781,5,"This was a hidden gem. A small establishment hidden away on the side of a building, can be easily missed. The interior is simple with almost an upscale feel (not an interior designer). The staff are kind, very knowledgeable and very descriptive. We literally translated everything while we waited for the bar. The bar is nice, you get to see a glimpse of the magic in the kitchen.  The food selection is quality, oysters at a very good price, a variety of excellent food. Duck ham (canard jambon) was delicious and the mustard pairing was excellent. My wife loved the guinea fowl pate (parfait), she said it was probably the best pate she has ever had, spread with the toast it was amazing. I don't recall the French translation but it was like mini croquettes with caviar and fennel with a crab bisque, my goodness it was so divine. (Potatoes are always underrated) This dish was by far one of the best potato dishes I have had. I can't recall our last dish, I believe it was some kind of spinach pasta with almonds/hazelnuts, out of what we got it wasn't our favourite but it was still tasty and very different from what we have eaten. There was a lot of crunch in every bite, it is a nut heavy dish but I would still ask for seconds if I could. Buvette was amazing, our first dinner in QC city and we were amazed by the offerings. We can't wait to go back!"
Buvette Scott,Canadian (New),"821 Rue Scott Quebec City, QC G1R 3C8 Canada",QC,46.80926,-71.2211781,5,"One of the best dining experiences I’ve ever had. Concise menu, wine list, beers and cocktails curated beyond perfection. Stunning selections only. Bar server last night guided us with a custom pairing. Vibes are right with spinning vinyl. Friendly and welcoming crew. Spring asparagus and shrimp with Halibut roe dill mint and buttermilk dressing - wow."
Le Pape Georges,Canadian (New),"8 Rue du Cul-de-Sac Quebec City, QC G1K 8L4 Canada",QC,46.8123861,-71.203416,2,"Old pub with poor ventilation. The washrooms were filthy with tissue boxes on the floor and had no soap. They only had hand sanitizer in a washroom with a sink, very bizarre. Could see bugs flying around the washroom too. The food was mediocre and over priced. The entrees were $30+ and not worth it in quality. The wings were tasty though. This is probably good if you want something to drink and bar food. If it weren’t for the fact that we needed to eat before our ghost tour, I would have left the pub when I saw how stuffy it was."
Le Pape Georges,Canadian (New),"8 Rue du Cul-de-Sac Quebec City, QC G1K 8L4 Canada",QC,46.8123861,-71.203416,5,"The selection of food wasn’t the greatest but for a bar in an old artistic building, the service offered made up to it. The two servers did all from serving, bartending and washing dishes. The server was so welcoming even though we are a larger group of 7 with 2 kids."
Le Pape Georges,Canadian (New),"8 Rue du Cul-de-Sac Quebec City, QC G1K 8L4 Canada",QC,46.8123861,-71.203416,5,"If you don't like or have no interest in trying hearty pub fare in a nearly 400 year old building, don't come here. If you expect to be pampered by hip servers and trendy dishes, this isn't the place for you.

BUT.

If you love buildings with great history and staff with stories to tell, then put Pape Georges at the top of your list! The pub is dark, the ceilings are low, and the food is fantastic! I loved how Chef Diony (?) (when I asked, he said to pronounce it sort of like ""Denny"" lol!) cooks everything in a tiny little kitchen right at the bar. He had, like, 10 pots going at once, all stacked on top of each other - I feel like this is the kind of place Anthony Bourdain would spend an entire day savouring!

I ordered nachos (recommended addition: firebarn sauce!!). Warning to US visitors - these nachos aren't like our nachos but they're so good! Instead of ground meat and salsa, theirs is loaded with chili (lots of beans), chopped veggies, and a white sauce of some kind... like I said, different but delicious! And if you like a little flavourful heat, add that firebarn sauce!

I'm back in Chicago today but, when I return to Quebec City, Pape Georges is at the top of my list!"

Le Billig,Creperies,"481 Rue Saint-Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1P5 Canada",QC,46.8093774,-71.221245,5,The crepes were surprisingly delicious. I tried Benedict with spinach and mushroom and also the duck confit crepe. Both were tasty， especially with its specially made sauce. They would be even better if less salty. The crepes desserts were amazing. We really want to go again next day after the meal.
Le Billig,Creperies,"481 Rue Saint-Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1P5 Canada",QC,46.8093774,-71.221245,5,"Worth the trip here, food was amazing! We ordered one savory and one sweet both are filling and lived up to expectations. Service was also great, very nice staff and the best was that it’s pet-friendly! (As long as you are able to find a seat to dine outdoor) We made reservations two days before. Parking is a bit hard but we found one for 1 hour. It was good enough! Highly recommended if your looking for the best crêpes in town!"
Le Billig,Creperies,"481 Rue Saint-Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1P5 Canada",QC,46.8093774,-71.221245,4,"We shared the appetizer sampler between the two of us. Nibbling on the local salami and cheeses with local beer and a good conversation was quite enjoyable. The dessert was crepe with poached pear, but the pear was underwhelming.

Our server was quite busy, but we did not feel neglected. We asked for more bread, but the kitchen ran out and she apologized several times."
Le Billig,Creperies,"481 Rue Saint-Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1P5 Canada",QC,46.8093774,-71.221245,5,"Really enjoyed my ciders and crêpe!  There're many types of good ciders you can choose.

Le Hobbit,French,"700 Rue Saint Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1P9 Canada",QC,46.810715,-71.218723,3,"Went there for brunch. Was a bit hangover and the food did not hit the spot. Portions are small (as intended, but the prices don't reflect that). I took the Benedictine (as recommended by our waitress), but it was not worth the 35$ I ended paying for (40 with coffee). I feel like they try to be more fancy than they need to. PS : my friends made their own breakfast with the side dishes available and this was well better in terms of value amd pretty good (especially the sausage)"
Le Hobbit,French,"700 Rue Saint Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1P9 Canada",QC,46.810715,-71.218723,2,"We made a reservation for New Year's Eve. Upon arriving and to our surprise, they informed us that they would only be serving a fixed 7 course menu. They really should have informed us before hand. A few other surprised customers who made reservations decided to leave on the spot. With limited options without a reservation on New Year's Eve, we decided to stay. They were not able to accommodate our mushroom allergy request since the menu was fixed. While we enjoyed the ""to the sea..."" dish and the ""looking forward..."" dessert, we were not a big fan of the other dishes. The ""through the forest..."" dish was too sweet. The rest of the dishes were not that special, and certainly not worth the price. The staff were friendly and the restaurant had a nice atmosphere."
Le Hobbit,French,"700 Rue Saint Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1P9 Canada",QC,46.810715,-71.218723,4,"Come here for the taste of the delicious food, not the quantity like at a regular breakfast joint.  So you might want to order an extra dish on the side.  I got the bacon!

Depending on the day, you’re better to make a reservation.

For Chinese takeout in Quebec city, this place actually exceeded our expectations! The ladies up front only spoke French but the Chinese cook and manager who are both quadrilingual came out to greet us because my mom and I only speak Chinese and English.

Légende,Canadian (New),"255 Rue Saint-Paul Quebec City, QC G1K 3W5 Canada",QC,46.8169296,-71.21006,5,"Was looking for a little weekend break from Montreal and I had not been to Quebec city in a while... As I made my travel arrangements I was told: ""you must go to Légende"". And I am so glad I listened.  This was my best dinning experience in years.
My experience dinning at the bar at Légende on a Saturday night was amazing. The proposal of the tasting menu were left me blown away and the wine pairing was absolutely perfect!! I kept on been blown away by the flavors on my plate dish after dish! Do yourself a favor and just open up to the experience by having the tasting menu and beverage pairing which can be wine or non alcoholic option (and those looked amazing). I congratulate the team! Can't wait to try it again."
Légende,Canadian (New),"255 Rue Saint-Paul Quebec City, QC G1K 3W5 Canada",QC,46.8169296,-71.21006,5,"OMG is the best phrase I can use to describe the food and service at Legende.  This is world-class dining at its finest in Quebec City.  Probably the best oysters on the planet.  Be sure to try the five course fixed menu as it is their specialty and whatever other recommendations staff may make.  The employees are really knowledgeable on the wine pairing choices, for example.

95 percent of the food is locally or regionally sourced and therefore fresh and tasty.  Presentation and service were also impeccable.

A little on the expensive side of course, but if you go easy on the wine, it can be reasonable.  A once in a lifetime culinary opportunity for me.  Highly recommended for foodies or just anybody who wants to enjoy superior dining."

I did the Ala carte and my husband did the 5 course tasting. Every single item was delivered perfectly. The staff explained each item as it was brought out.

Timing of food vs wine vs cutlery were off meaning the food was being served while either the wine, the cutlery or both were not there.
The pacing of the courses was off and we had to wait fairly long in between courses.
The menu is very traditional and delicious.
The wine pairing was good too and when I personally did not like one wine they kindly replaced it with an other wine.

The 7 course discovery menu is more like a 5 course dinner

They counted the amuse (micro size bite) as a course and the pallet cleanser (no picture) too. And honestly with those included I only get to 6 courses. They also only served 5 glasses of wine pairing.

The back dining room is spectacular"
Le Saint-Amour,French,"48 Rue Sainte-Ursule Quebec City, QC G1R 4E2 Canada",QC,46.8112469,-71.2103292,5,We enjoyed a 7 course dinner at Le Saint-Amour! You must know ahead of time that having a 7 course meal means you are going to be sitting and eating for a long time! The preparation and presentation of each dish was gorgeous! You need to be prepared for very rich food and have an appreciation for French cuisine!
Le Saint-Amour,French,"48 Rue Sainte-Ursule Quebec City, QC G1R 4E2 Canada",QC,46.8112469,-71.2103292,3,"Foie Gras hot appetizer: it tastes really bad. The taste and presentation of the entire dish are simply not harmonious. Foie gras itself taste and smell slightly bloody, even the citrus taste from berries can not overcome it.
Halibut with Leek: the aroma of leek is quite appetizing, however the sauce is salty which take away the freshness of the halibut. It’s sad because halibut is cooked perfectly.
Palate Cleanser: I would say it’s better just serve high quality tea. Cuz there’s a herbal taste from this sherbet is very strong.
Duck Breast and Duck Heart: this is the MVP of the menu. Crispy skin with tender meat is very satisfying. Garnish matches perfectly with protein duck heart!
Desert: taste is very good, I love the sweetness with the sourness from the blueberries. Nuts are highlight. However, it’s difficult to eat with cutlery. I had to handheld."
Le Saint-Amour,French,"48 Rue Sainte-Ursule Quebec City, QC G1R 4E2 Canada",QC,46.8112469,-71.2103292,5,"Six stars if we could.   Beautiful ambience paired with gourmet, well thought out cuisine.  They made something special for my vegetarian wife that left a smile on her face.  Wine list was fantastic as well along with very friendly and intuitive wait staff.  Please don’t skip desert!  This place has a very special place in our hearts."
Le Saint-Amour,French,"48 Rue Sainte-Ursule Quebec City, QC G1R 4E2 Canada",QC,46.8112469,-71.2103292,5,"Love the food and the service. We were worried that we didn’t bring any fancy clothes with us on our short trip to QC plus with a young toddler they won’t serve us. I called and they said they have no dress code. The staff are all nice and friendly, feels like a family restaurant vibe. The food from the presentation to the taste are superb.

This is a place where you would want to come back whenever you feel to spurge for a special occasion. The dinning time is long but it was good that we didn’t feel rushed and we took the time to enjoy the meal and really taste the favor profile.

One minor criticism is that when we first arrived they put us in a separate room. So two occasions our request has been forgotten and we have to remind them about the order. They don’t have assigned servers but multiple people come to serve you at random so maybe there’s some communication gaps. For a fine dining restaurant that might be something they want to look into."
Bistro 1640,French,"20 Rue Sainte-Anne Quebec City, QC G1R 3X2 Canada",QC,46.8131553,-71.2059992,5,Amazing place. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by the service. The restaurant staff really does their best to keep guests happy. We had dinner overlooking the castle with delicious food. Thank you so much! We will definitely be back:)
Bistro 1640,French,"20 Rue Sainte-Anne Quebec City, QC G1R 3X2 Canada",QC,46.8131553,-71.2059992,4,"A charming restaurant in the historic district of Quebec City with a warm but modern atmosphere, with exposed brick walls, cozy lighting, and a laid-back vibe. The menu features a variety of French-inspired dishes, with a focus on fresh and seasonal ingredients. All the dishes were flavorful, from the duck to the tartar. The wine list is also impressive, with a great selection of bottles from all over the world. Service is attentive and friendly, with knowledgeable staff who are happy to make recommendations and answer any questions you may have. The only reason I'm giving this restaurant a 4/5 is that the prices are a bit steep, especially considering the portion sizes."
Bistro 1640,French,"20 Rue Sainte-Anne Quebec City, QC G1R 3X2 Canada",QC,46.8131553,-71.2059992,5,"We went to Bistro 1640 on a quiet Monday afternoon.  We went for the Onion Soup and we were not disappointed.  Excellent decor, great place for a meal or a drink.  The soup was great.  You could even taste the added thyme."
Bistro 1640,French,"20 Rue Sainte-Anne Quebec City, QC G1R 3X2 Canada",QC,46.8131553,-71.2059992,5,"This is my third time here in recent weeks. The reason I keep coming back is the consistently good service, food, drink and location. The outdoor café has a long, narrow bar table facing the Chateau Frontenac so that you can people-watch. Great fun. So we’ve got a wonderful neighborhood place to frequent all summer long!

We’re especially fond of the pizza fromagère - delicious. And we’re critical, being Americans and self-designated pizza experts! Also, the Québécois “cidre” (pronounced “see-dra”) is very good here. We love cidre because it’s summer and we need light and refreshing drinks all day long…

Oh, and there’s a very cool indoor bar when it gets too hot in the summer. Again, great service – but in an intimate space.

We will keep going back. Love it!"
Bistro 1640,French,"20 Rue Sainte-Anne Quebec City, QC G1R 3X2 Canada",QC,46.8131553,-71.2059992,4,"Excellent gastro pub in the old city. The steak was excellent as were all of the pizzas and the French onion soup as well as the soup of the day (pea). We tried the cheese pizza, charcuterie pizza and the chocolate dessert.  All were excellent."
Poutineville,Burgers,"735 Rue Saint-Joseph E Quebec City, QC G1K 3C6 Canada",QC,46.8156233,-71.2198799,5,"Delicious poutine place!! Has different types of poutine, burgers and salads. Waiter was very friendly and restaurant was clean. Enjoyable experience. Would visit again! (When I’m feeling hungry 😂)"
Poutineville,Burgers,"735 Rue Saint-Joseph E Quebec City, QC G1K 3C6 Canada",QC,46.8156233,-71.2198799,4,"We heard this was the best in Quebec and had to follow the crowds! We had the hangover and were pretty happy with our decision but it's standard fare. Beers were on tap, staff were friendly and attentive, a decent place to drop in on for a fast greasy craving."
Poutineville,Burgers,"735 Rue Saint-Joseph E Quebec City, QC G1K 3C6 Canada",QC,46.8156233,-71.2198799,5,"As a Quebecer, I can confidently say this is a great poutine spot. First and foremost, staff was super friendly and accommodating. They had a new menu and unfortunately they didn't have all the ingredients yet (Mid-July 2023). We settled on the Galvaude, which I believe is inspired by the traditional Quebec Hot Chicken dish. Everything about it was right - perfect amount of gravy, squeaky cheese curds and fresh toppings. It is quite pricy but if you share, it's totally worth it. Finally, if anyone is not familiar with tipping, the receipt suggests the right amount to give if you liked the service/food, which, in my opinion, can be pretty helpful. I would definitely eat there again when around and craving poutine."
Poutineville,Burgers,"735 Rue Saint-Joseph E Quebec City, QC G1K 3C6 Canada",QC,46.8156233,-71.2198799,5,"I recently had the pleasure of visiting Poutineville, and I must say it was a gastronomic delight! This restaurant truly lives up to its reputation as the best poutine place in all of Quebec, and I can confidently say that my taste buds have never been happier.

Poutineville takes the classic Quebecois dish and elevates it to new heights with their creative and mouthwatering combinations. We decided to venture beyond the traditional and opted for the Mexican Poutine, Vegetable & Pepper Poutine and the Mac & Cheese Wedgies. They also have wonderful beverages options.

The parking is little tough. If you are lucky enough then you can get your parking right outside the street ($2-$3 per hour) off the restaurant or else you will need to find in other streets and walk back to restaurant.

Apart from the exceptional food, the service at Poutineville was exemplary. The staff members were friendly, attentive, and genuinely passionate about their craft. They took the time to explain the various poutine options and even offered recommendations based on our preferences. The restaurant itself had a warm and inviting ambiance, making it a perfect place to enjoy a satisfying meal with friends or family."
Poutineville,Burgers,"735 Rue Saint-Joseph E Quebec City, QC G1K 3C6 Canada",QC,46.8156233,-71.2198799,5,The food was delicious. Our first time having poutine from Quebec. I tried the poutineville. Hubby tried the hangover cure. Well worth it. The waiter quickly noticed I don’t speak adequate French even though I tried. He gave us English menus and proceeded to give us the rest of our service in English.

Beautiful and delicious cocktails together with flavorful food is the perfect harmony. The butter goes with the bread is amazing and the porchetta is so good and first time trying blood budding, it takes good too! The presentation of their cocktails ordered. If you have some other cocktails you’d like to try, the bartender can definitely accommodate."

My friends and I ordered oysters too. Fresh. So good.

We were here on a short trip , and it really made us happy and full :)

Le Continental,French,"26 Rue Saint Louis Quebec City, QC G1R 3Y9 Canada",QC,46.8119186,-71.2069784,5,"Great food and a spectacular experience. The staff was amazing and the table side theatrics exceeded expectations. We ordered fillets and salmon as the main courses and the portions were perfect for a multi course meal. Suggest booking well in advance. We made the reservation a month early and got lucky with one reasonable dinner time option within a two week period. It’s also teen friendly and casual attire is acceptable even though the staff were super formal. It’s expensive, as expected, but a truly unique and memorable experience."
Le Continental,French,"26 Rue Saint Louis Quebec City, QC G1R 3Y9 Canada",QC,46.8119186,-71.2069784,5,"Eating here is a unique experience. The delicious food served consists of traditional French dishes expertly prepared and finished by the wait staff, which works like clockwork, in a perfectly coordinated, choreographed dance.
Our waiter not only took care of us and other tables, but also cooked our steak and a sauce, which means timing the preparation and thickening of the sauce, and the perfect cooking of a steak, to the point requested, while carrying out other tasks. The coordination and collaboration with other waiters is so effortless looking that is really an amazing thing to see"
Le Continental,French,"26 Rue Saint Louis Quebec City, QC G1R 3Y9 Canada",QC,46.8119186,-71.2069784,5,"Absolutely the finest food we had all week! So flavorful & delicious!

Le Continental,French,"26 Rue Saint Louis Quebec City, QC G1R 3Y9 Canada",QC,46.8119186,-71.2069784,5,"Great culinary experience.

We first heard about this place on one of Anthony Bourdain show.

It’s popular because they prepare the food in front of you which creates a nice ambiance in the restaurant as you have crème brûlée and other dishes like my filet mignon flaming in front of tables.

Good food. Clean place, nice staff,"
Le Continental,French,"26 Rue Saint Louis Quebec City, QC G1R 3Y9 Canada",QC,46.8119186,-71.2069784,5,"Delicious fine dining. The foie gras was my favorite part, they have 4-5 foie gras items in the menu so you can ask the waiter to clarify the differences if you’re as confused as I was. The Caesar was delicious and the escargot was as well."
Q-de-Sac Resto-Pub,Gastropubs,"10 Rue du Cul-de-Sac Quebec City, QC G1K 4E8 Canada",QC,46.8124219,-71.2034239,5,"I enjoyed my onion soup and duck wings!  Also, they have really good cocktail! Gin with maple whiskey is the best!
The bartender was caring and friendly.  Price is reasonable for me. I'd like to visit there again if I have chance."
Q-de-Sac Resto-Pub,Gastropubs,"10 Rue du Cul-de-Sac Quebec City, QC G1K 4E8 Canada",QC,46.8124219,-71.2034239,5,"Loved the authentic, European, back-alley pub style feel of Q-De-Sac. It was a wet, rainy day when my wife and I stumbled upon this place in Petit Champlain. Beautiful upwards view of the Chateau as well. We were looking for a good French Onion soup and boy, did they deliver. Tasty, authentic, and homey, it was exactly what we needed. I believe it was voted one of the best in Quebec City.

They had a gorgeous wood oven for pizza as well and when I get a chance to go back, I will certainly try that. We also ordered a beef tartare, and a classic poutine. Both very tasty and delicious. The server was a super nice guy, attentive, and made sure we were comfortable. Spoke both in English and French.

We were there in the afternoon but it seems like  a place that could get pretty rowdy on a weekend night. The patio looked spacey and comfortable as well. Definitely a place you should try, and a place I'll frequent when I'm back in QBC."
Q-de-Sac Resto-Pub,Gastropubs,"10 Rue du Cul-de-Sac Quebec City, QC G1K 4E8 Canada",QC,46.8124219,-71.2034239,5,"Last week (June 2022) my husband and I visited Q -de-sac Resto Pub twice on our four day visit to Québec!

The first time we sat on the patio and enjoyed their duck wings (big and delicious with a soy-based sauce) and their small poutine which was fantastic!! As avid craft beer drinkers, my husband enjoyed an IPA and I had their Senor Cacao Caramilk Stout which was one of my fav beers of this trip.

We visited a second time for supper and shared their small poutine (the large has fois gras which we weren’t a fan of) as well as their French Onion Soup and a pepperoni pizza which is cooked in their wood burning pizza oven. All were excellent. In addition to great beer and food (and friendly service), they also had an amazing band that played from the second story into the crowd in the cul-de-sac. They were fantastic and it was a great time. Q-de-Sac is now on our list of must-visit places the next time we’re in Québec. Just make sure to check if they’re open in less popular seasons - they were closed in October 2021 when we last visited. Highly recommended."

Paillard,Bakeries,"1097 Rue Saint-Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1S3 Canada",QC,46.8137505,-71.2107733,5,"The pastries here are fantastic! There's a huge selection with everything from chocolate croissants to donuts overloaded with jam. There are also breakfast sandwiches available for those who want something more substantial.

With lots of seating at big communal tables, this is a fun spot and great for families though there are a few steps out front that can be tricky with a stroller. There is an accessible washroom on the main floor and more upstairs if you don't want to wait.

Prices are average and it's convenient."
Paillard,Bakeries,"1097 Rue Saint-Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1S3 Canada",QC,46.8137505,-71.2107733,5,"Incredible food! There is usually a long wait, and there seemed fewer people than needed for a long weekend Saturday to speed up the line, but all in all the wait was worth the quality. The croissant was delicious. Had the most amazing macarons… crispy shell and soft inside. Worth giving a try!"
Paillard,Bakeries,"1097 Rue Saint-Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1S3 Canada",QC,46.8137505,-71.2107733,4,"We went at 9 in the morning and there was quite a line.

We got the croissant and a latte. The croissant was soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside, but not fresh-from-the-oven fresh. It had really great buttery flavor and was on the greasier side.

The latte was too foamy (basically cappuccino).

There were no more seats inside so we sat outside which was quite nice.

Service was good, but the line took a while because people were ordering a lot and didn't know quite what they wanted. A lot of tourists."
Paillard,Bakeries,"1097 Rue Saint-Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1S3 Canada",QC,46.8137505,-71.2107733,4,"Nice, large pastry shop with a wide variety of baked goods. Friendly employees and fast service. Ordered a croissant which was tasty and right out of the oven, along with a delicious latte with lots of foamy froth. Only miss was my fruit cup which was watery and not very fresh. If you go here, best to stick to the baked goods. Overall, a pleasant cafe in Old Quebec City."
Paillard,Bakeries,"1097 Rue Saint-Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1S3 Canada",QC,46.8137505,-71.2107733,2,"Exceptional: almond filled croissant.

The good: selection. Attentive staff once you get to the counter and it’s your turn. Bacon cheese pastry.

The bad: place is understaffed. Took forever to place your order and no one was cleaning the tables.

The ugly: from the entrance doors to the tables everything needs some cleaning. Dirty glass door, tables and floors needed attention but no staff around. so if you’re planning on sitting down with a sandwich and a coffee you will not be able to enjoy it. Makes you wonder if their kitchen is the same way."
Ophelia,Seafood,"634 Grande Allée E Quebec City, QC G1R 2K5 Canada",QC,46.8065257,-71.2166607,5,"My husband and I came here tonight after seeing some reviews on Google. We were very pleased!

The design inside is to demonstrate water VS earth and it's pretty well done. It's like being on a boat with some creepy paintings. It's a whole vibe - We were given the option to either sit facing eachother or to be sat side by side. We chose side by side because you can see the kitchen and oversee the bottom of the restaurant. Fun experience (see photos).

As for the food, I really wanted clam chowder so they brought it to me even before our wine arrived. They must have sensed my need for the chow. Delicious. I got the rib eye, he the New York sirloin. We compared them and they were both different levels of amazing. The dessert recommended by Felix was to die for. Like a fancy donut pastry. Get that.

Thanks Félix and hosts/chef /staff"
Ophelia,Seafood,"634 Grande Allée E Quebec City, QC G1R 2K5 Canada",QC,46.8065257,-71.2166607,2,"we waited 1 hour just to get our appetizers and 1 hour to get the main dish. Not to mention the proteins of the dish were astoundingly inconsistent. The steak was very dry and tough on its periphery with an inconsistent cook throughout its interior. The octopus was mushy and honestly, very under seasoned. The porc belly had a nice crust but had no bite to it. It just crumbled and disolved but not in a melty-buttery kind of way… almost like the quality of the cut was bad. On the plus side the shrimps were excellent and the sides were very well cooked. The sauces were pleasant too. Our table on the terrasse was also right next to a sewer :’) Those nice pieces of food amidst the rest of the disaster are whats keeping me from giving the experience a one star. From the other reviews this does not seem to be the standard of the restaurant and may have just been a tough night by one of the chefs. That being said for the price of each dish, I think it is fair to expect more consistency. Plating was very nice but unfortunately deceiving :("
Ophelia,Seafood,"634 Grande Allée E Quebec City, QC G1R 2K5 Canada",QC,46.8065257,-71.2166607,5,"We had brunch in an “outside heated plexiglass bubble” at this wonderful restaurant.
The food was so tasty made with fresh local ingredients.
The decor was really romantic and a must try at least once.
The waiter (Jacob)  was very professional with his services , attentions and welcoming.
We haven’t had good quality services like that in a long time.
We will absolutely go back in the bubbles but for diner next time!
Great job 👏"
Ophelia,Seafood,"634 Grande Allée E Quebec City, QC G1R 2K5 Canada",QC,46.8065257,-71.2166607,4,"For the price you pay, I was expecting better food. The main dishes were very good, but the appetizers were just ok. The oysters were just a big Meehhhh and the buffala cheese was good but a little small.
The main dishes were pretty good, interesting mixes between land and sea.
As per the service, it was good, but the fact that our waiter took wine and drinks with the patrons make me feel weird. There are boundaries between clients and waiters. Your client may also be your friend, but reserve your alcohol intake and friendship for after-hours.
I liked the ambiance, it was a bit noisy but the music at a decent level and the general atmosphere was great. It was our anniversary and they gave us two macarons, which we appreciate.
There is no parking reserved for this restaurant, you have to park on the street or in the public paid parking across the street."
Ophelia,Seafood,"634 Grande Allée E Quebec City, QC G1R 2K5 Canada",QC,46.8065257,-71.2166607,5,"Let me first start by saying HATS OFF TO THE CHEF AND STAFF!   Food and Service was the best I've had in the year and a half I've been here in Québec.  Wish more places could use them as an example of what good food and service should look like.
We enjoyed a Steak and Seafood plate for two.   The very best steak I have ever hand as good as mine at home (I am a retired chef).  Seafood wish I had ordered more yummy.
Wine menu consists of delightful selections.
Service was wonderful!
When reading the Google reviews keep in mind that this place should have 4 or 5 $$$$ signs as it is very expensive.  But it is worth every bite! Thanks again for a wonderful meal."

It did not disappoint! Service was excellent and the menu had a wonderful selection of game which is what we really wanted! The food was delicious, the portions were massive and the wine was lovely! We had another very enjoyable time here and highly recommend it!!!"
Aux Anciens Canadiens,Canadian (New),"34 Rue Saint-Louis Quebec City, QC G1R 4P3 Canada",QC,46.8117626,-71.2076,4,"Loved the history and the old charm of this restaurant - built in the 1600 wow!!

The menu is price fixed, you can choose things to eat, plus upgrades on most of the expensive meats. You get a starter, a main and a dessert, plus a wine or beer. I got the meat trio which is what I saw online before I arrived. It was elk, bison and deer. I thought it was a hit overcooked but the sauce and potato gratin was tasty.

The winner and what my family came for was the maple syrup tart, it was very rich and sweet but so unique and delicious.

Cool vibes, it was like we were dining in the olden days. Do make reservations, as the restaurant fills up quickly!"
Aux Anciens Canadiens,Canadian (New),"34 Rue Saint-Louis Quebec City, QC G1R 4P3 Canada",QC,46.8117626,-71.2076,5,"We came to QC for work and ended up eating here twice in one week. The food was outstanding! If I lived here, I would visit every day for the pea soup. I ordered the slow roasted beef tenderloin both nights and it was fabulous and my husband had the bison bourguignon and the AAA filet with fries and he said it was “glorious”. We had both the maple syrup and blueberry pie. I preferred the blueberry, but if you like pecan pie try the maple syrup for sure. The meals were quality ingredients both nights and the flavors worked really well together. This is a great restaurant to visit in Quebec City. Also, Nicholas and Samuel were the kindest waiters. We truly had the best time with both."

Highly recommend this place!"
Aux Anciens Canadiens,Canadian (New),"34 Rue Saint-Louis Quebec City, QC G1R 4P3 Canada",QC,46.8117626,-71.2076,5,"The restaurant has an ambient and cozy vibe. There is a pre-fixed menu including an appetizer, main course and dessert, which costs about $67. You can also select just any main course on their own. We ordered the duck on salad and duck on poutine for main course. The duck meat tastes amazing and the salad was very well-balanced. Though the poutine as also very good, the portion was very large, so we couldn’t finish the dish. The cream brûlée was good but very sweet. If you’re not a sweet tooth, be prepared. The service was friendly, quick and attentive. Definitely would come back to try other french cuisine dishes!"
Chez Jules,Brasseries,"24 Rue Sainte-Anne Quebec City, QC G1R 3X3 Canada",QC,46.8131322,-71.2064395,3,Best French Onion Soup I’ve Had But The Restaurant Hadn’t Been Clean. At All Staff Is Very Nice And Quick. I Decided To Try The French Onion Soup And The Ravioli The French Onion Soup Was Very Tasty And Kinda Hot And So As The Ravioli My Server Is Very Kind And Speaks Good English I Don’t Have Good French Worth The Money Spent!. Amazing Food!
Chez Jules,Brasseries,"24 Rue Sainte-Anne Quebec City, QC G1R 3X3 Canada",QC,46.8131322,-71.2064395,1,"This place was recommended and unfortunately it is nothing but a tourist trap. Collectively we spent over $400 CAD on food that was poorly unsalted, unseasoned, flavourless, and unfortunately we couldn’t finish the meal.

The side salads had a handful of red peppercorns. The steak was charred and burnt as if they didn’t clean their grill. The server did not ask us for how we wanted the steak cooked and when it came, it was medium well, not ideal at all. The vegetables in the beef cheeks were boiled down and mushy with no bite to it. The snails were not fresh and did not come in a shell as other pictures indicated. In addition, there was a lemon peel in the baked potato for one of the orders. It made the whole potato taste bitter.

Perhaps the only redeemable thing was the wine. We left extremely disappointed. A clear misrepresentation of French food in Quebec City."
Chez Jules,Brasseries,"24 Rue Sainte-Anne Quebec City, QC G1R 3X3 Canada",QC,46.8131322,-71.2064395,2,"Quite different menu than the menu & food posted here.
We came to this restaurant for its good reviews. Unfortunately, it did not live up to our expectations. We went there for brunch, and the price is double the price in the menu poster here. Other than that, some French food posted here disappeared from our menu, like frog legs. The duck breast in my salad was pretty dry and a little hard to chew. The beef cheek was nothing but salty. Probably it explains why at 12:30pm, it was pretty empty compared to restaurants in same street."
Chez Jules,Brasseries,"24 Rue Sainte-Anne Quebec City, QC G1R 3X3 Canada",QC,46.8131322,-71.2064395,5,"Since where we live, finding French cuisine is a bit difficult and when we do, the food is a little... safe. We wanted a real French experience and decided on Chez Jules. We made a great choice. We ordered the duck breast, escargots, blood sausage, and frog legs. Just a tad bit more salt on the duck breast and frog legs, but they were delicious. I never knew frog legs and mayo go so well together. The frog legs had the best texture and taste I've ever had. More often than not, they can be rubbery and that falls on the chef, if not just the quality of freshness.The duck was cooked well and not gamey at all. It didn't have that dark meat taste, which I like. The blood sausage was a little too livery for me, but my dinner date loved it. Everything from the service to food was great. Another impressive restaurant in Old Quebec City."

We had an amazing experience Dining here, highly recommended to check out if you are in the area! The French onion soup and escargot were amazing! Great atmosphere and 10/10 service!"
Tora-Ya Ramen,Ramen,"75 Rue Saint-Joseph E Ville de Québec, QC G1K 3A6 Canada",QC,46.8123071,-71.2301377,4,Had some ramen craving during a little weekend trip in Quebec City. There was a line up in front of this small ramen joint and we decided to give it a try. We were pleasantly surprised by this gem and we slurped our bowls of ramen within 10 minutes. Portions were a bit small to my liking otherwise everything was yummy!
Tora-Ya Ramen,Ramen,"75 Rue Saint-Joseph E Ville de Québec, QC G1K 3A6 Canada",QC,46.8123071,-71.2301377,5,"A great place for a ramen! Place is tight, table spacing is within an arm’s reach. Parking is by the road or any near garage. Food is great! Quantity and quality is superb. Service is wonderful, i guess our waiter was rafael if im not mistaken. Truly an asset. They accept credit/debit card. Bathroom is a bit unpleasing but would do. If you want a deep talk then probably this is not the place since it gets loud specially when packed. They do have a high chair"

It was busy, but we didn't have to wait too long for a seat. The service was excellent for such a busy place. Although it was packed, we found the atmosphere to be nice and cozy. I ordered the miso ramen with veggies & my friend ordered the vegetarian ramen. Both were very tasty. I've had ramen in Japan and found the ramen here to be very authentic in flavour. If you're in the area, I highly recommend Tora-Ya Ramen!"

Chez Temporel,French,"25 Rue Couillard Quebec City, QC G1R 3T4 Canada",QC,46.8151307,-71.208233,5,"Amazing service and fantastic food. This was a really delightful restaurant to eat at to round out a day of exploring the city. It’s tucked away and has a really laid back atmosphere. The food was delectable from the first bite to the last with flavor combinations that will knock your socks off.

If you’re a fan of (alcoholic) Ciders, make sure to order one for your table as you take your time with your meal. You won’t regret it.

The menu changes regularly, but you will not be disappointed in the food no matter what’s being served—a lot of care clearly goes into the menu here."
Chez Temporel,French,"25 Rue Couillard Quebec City, QC G1R 3T4 Canada",QC,46.8151307,-71.208233,5,Loved their escargots. There was a tiny wait to get a table. I got the venison with mashed potatoes and that was yummy. I usually don’t like french onion soup but i really liked theirs.   They have a limited menu that changes to the season. Our waitress was very kind.
Chez Temporel,French,"25 Rue Couillard Quebec City, QC G1R 3T4 Canada",QC,46.8151307,-71.208233,4,"Went here for brunch and dinner.

Ordered the Continental for brunch, which had a butter crossaint, a boiled egg, a small portion of fruit, and candied citrus. For the $14 it cost, this was a good meal to start the day.

Came back for dinner and ordered the Terrine, which was a chicken liver pate-mousse, with crusty bread, and candied citrus peel. Although I wouldn't say this is my palette, it was still very good and tasty. I could have probably got a bit more bread, as I was smearing big portions of the mousse on it.

My entree was a mushroom risotto, which I added duck to. The duck was very tender and moist. The risotto was cooked almost al-dante as it has some bits of crunchiness to it. It was very creamy, and had some good pieces of mushroom. A very good meal.

The staff were very friendly and answered questions, and the atmosphere of the place is nice and off the beaten path. Definitely will return to this establishment if I come back to the city."
Chez Temporel,French,"25 Rue Couillard Quebec City, QC G1R 3T4 Canada",QC,46.8151307,-71.208233,5,"My favourite place to eat in Quebec.

Known for their outstanding duck, we ordered the snails on pastry and duck risotto which where equally sensational. The snails balanced a subtle profile of lightness and creaminess whilst the duck risotto was bold with crispy duck and earthy mushrooms. This bristo is all quality!"

The coffee is pretty good as well.

The chocolate almond croissant is the best I've ever had."

Soup was delicious and clearly homemade, as was the fromage cheese appetizer which was creamy and flavorful. Pasta was cooked to perfection and wasn’t too oily with just the right amount of spice. Service was friendly and efficient. Highly recommend this Italian dive in Quebec City."
Ciccio Cafe,Italian,"875 Claire Fontaine Quebec City, QC G1R 3A8 Canada",QC,46.8082729,-71.2217224,4,Food was great especially the steak. The salmon fish was not upto expectation so no points for that. The highlight was the dessert.

The Fettucine Alfredo is really bland. It was the only dish we found that was hard to finish out of everything we tried here."
Ciccio Cafe,Italian,"875 Claire Fontaine Quebec City, QC G1R 3A8 Canada",QC,46.8082729,-71.2217224,5,"Very good services and food. Recommend the snail with cream sauce.

For the price I was expecting maybe a bigger burger, but taste was good. Also you have  a beautiful view, so I think it might be pricey but is worth it.

The service was just ok, we needed to ask many times for the bill because they were I guess distracted (even when the restaurant was not that crowded) the waitress that finally came with the bill was very nice."
Le Chic Shack,Burgers,"15 Rue du Fort Quebec City, QC G1R 3Z8 Canada",QC,46.8130888,-71.2052499,5,"Perfect spot for a quick lunch when in the upper city. Close to the Chateau.

Le Chic Shack,Burgers,"15 Rue du Fort Quebec City, QC G1R 3Z8 Canada",QC,46.8130888,-71.2052499,4,"We got the chicken burger combos.
The burger itself was okay, but the fries, chip and their sodas were fantastic.
When I visited next I'll skip the burger and go for the poutine which looked pretty good on a neighbouring table."

They have their own drinks which tastes good. Their burger is different and tastes great! Vibe is chill. Service is wonderful. Place is clean. Has a bathroom. They have high chairs. Accepts credit and debit. No parking space.
Le Chic Shack,Burgers,"15 Rue du Fort Quebec City, QC G1R 3Z8 Canada",QC,46.8130888,-71.2052499,1,"By far, this goes on Mount Rushmore of the worst restaurant experiences ever.

I visited Quebec City yesterday, coming from Montreal, and saw that this place has good reviews to dine in. I WAS WRONG.

Once we arrived, we were very rudely spoken to by one of the staff members, tall guy with a long beard, I think he is the manager there. The service was ZERO to NIL. Once our orders arrived, the waiter was LITERALLY tossing our plates in front of us, and whenever we would ask them a question, we were spoken to with complete rudeness and a lot of side eyes.

We were a group of 8 people, everyone’s orders arrived at 3:16 pm sharp, my order was missing, and did not arrive until 3:30 pm. The level of rudeness that the waiters had was actually through the roof.

The food, the sodas, the customer service, the setting, I give it a 0/10. There was one lady who gave us our receipts to pay, she was amazing actually, but that was it.

If you ever visit Quebec City, DO NOT go to this restaurant, or be prepared to leave disappointed.

0/10 food.
0/10 service.
10/10 never going there again.

To the waiter/manager with the long beard, you should work on your customer service skills, this is not a way to serve customers."

The staff ( Ana ) she's very nice, friendly and fast.

The chef his amazing. I watched him how he prepared our meal and he smile while he prepared our food and other customer's food.

Food is amazing and I definitely highly recommend this place.

Let's start supporting local and this place is close to our hotel which is Best Western ( walking distance)

Well done 👌👌🙏🙏"

We ordered the classic smoked meat sandwich and it just melts in your mouth. Pickles are super crunchy, the coleslaw was perfect. The server was friendly and even Phil came over to our table to check on us and thanked us for coming. It was all so good that we bought the packaged smoked meat and pickles to take back home to Ontario!"

Phil Smoked Meat,Sandwiches,"461 Rue Saint-Joseph E Quebec City, QC G1K 3B6 Canada",QC,46.8142512,-71.2237625,5,"The smoked meat is perfect. I ordered the classic sandwich medium smoked meat and regular smoked meat poutine. The meat is really tender and it feels like it just melted in my mouth. Really tasty. As a dessert, I ordered the tarte au sucre. This dessert is also great. Good choice after a heavy meal and you need something sweet for your sweet tooth. Although it's not in the menu, but the staff can offer you some of their dessert after your meal. The staff is also really nice and attentive. The washroom is really clean too. I will go back again next time."

You can order a brunch item and have access to the mini Buffet. The brunch options were excellent - highly recommend their eggs Benedict (and I’m not usually a fan of hollandaise sauce). They also have homemade jams and a delicious salted caramel which I now wish I bought to take home with me. And really delicious leek and Cheeze Pastry that had a perfect crust. The dining room itself is cute - it has a charming, fireplace and ambience of an upscale lodge."
Chez Muffy,French,"10 Rue Saint-Antoine Quebec City, QC G1K 4C9 Canada",QC,46.8145636,-71.201953,5,"Cozy and rich in history, Chez Muffy hosted us for breakfast.  The continental buffet for starters, with fresh juice and specialty coffees greeted us.

We then had just the right portion of our main breakfast dish, with a fire by our side.

The decor was tasteful and comfortable.

The service was gracious and attentive.

I could only imagine how the evening feast would be.  We will try on our next visit."
Chez Muffy,French,"10 Rue Saint-Antoine Quebec City, QC G1K 4C9 Canada",QC,46.8145636,-71.201953,5,"An experience of a lifetime! Pricey, but well worth it as the dining experience lasts the whole night. The staff is detailed and kind as they explain exactly what every dish is and how it is prepared. The menu is also frequently refreshed as to adapt to whichever foods are in season. Truly an amazing experience that you can thoroughly enjoy throughout the night as the different courses are spaced out to really taste all the different flavors. I frequent a lot of restaurants, including many high-end ones and I can say without a doubt Chez Muffy is ranked as my #1 spot. We also stayed at the Auberge Sainte-Antoine which allowed us to also enjoy breakfast which is prepared fresh daily."

The occasion was noted to the restaurant ahead however they forgot about it with zero mention or gesture towards us. Food quality was fine overall , but the dessert sorbet course was brought out half melted yet they decided it was ok to serve and even pointed out it was melting. At the price point they charge this is inappropriate"
Sapristi,Italian,"1001 Rue Saint-Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1S4 Canada",QC,46.8128432,-71.2125807,5,"Trying something different foods that I never tired before. Order a 1608 pizza. It was so delicious! Love the sauce and is thin dough and thick crust which is perfect balance/portion size. Came back few days to order Mac and cheese, it was good and glad they add something in it to taste more flavours. Cheesecake is definitely to try after meal. It way too good! English menu is available"
Sapristi,Italian,"1001 Rue Saint-Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1S4 Canada",QC,46.8128432,-71.2125807,3,Had a couple of pizzas and beers. Margarita pizza had too much tomato sauce and barely any cheese. The carnivore pizza was good! Neither pizza came cut which was difficult do on wobbly table with a full knife. Beer wasn’t cold. So not the greatest experience. Fun to people watch on the patio!
Sapristi,Italian,"1001 Rue Saint-Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1S4 Canada",QC,46.8128432,-71.2125807,4,"We noticed they have atleast two restaurants, this one right inside the fort wall of old town Quebec City and the other at the foothills near harbor close to Norte dam church.

Decor inside is great, modern, neat and clean. The food is palatable but nothing memorable. The service is prompt and friendly, from the host who seated us even before the restaurant opened to the wait staff, who answered all questions we had and attended us nicely. Prices are decent/modest.

We had the calamari and mozzarella sticks to start with. Calamari was standout especially because of the sauce, portions are really small for apps. Mozzarella nothing to remember was quite okaish.
For entrees we had the pasta ( pates) Sapristi, unique flavors, Pizza ( Grecque) Greek, was not a big fan of this and the flatbread margarita which was average.

Overall solid service, great decor and palatable food at decent prices sums up our experience at Sapristi."
Sapristi,Italian,"1001 Rue Saint-Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1S4 Canada",QC,46.8128432,-71.2125807,3,"The service is longer than expected.  We ordered an appetizer but never came but they didn't charge it neither.

The food was subpar.  Felt like a tourist traps.  The pasta was nothing special. My duck confit was lack of favor and my wife's seafood pasta was ok.

Wish we have gone somewhere else."
Sapristi,Italian,"1001 Rue Saint-Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1S4 Canada",QC,46.8128432,-71.2125807,5,We are here twice. Very good food and service. Ask to sit on back patio. Very relaxing. We ordered Carbonara and Buffalo chicken flatbread. Buffalo sauce is fairly mild.

Its a really small restaurant that can easily be missed. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but it definitely is worth going inside. There are 2 Tables for 4 people each, and 4 seats at the Bar.

I highly recommend trying the Poutine, its a good price for good amount of food.

The service was quick and very friendly"

It came with a chopped up smash burger, hot dog, and grilled onions mixed in. This was a heavy poutine that was also delicious. The small was definitely enough for one person and satisfying. The staff were also friendly, and the location itself is your usual small greasy spoon. Definitely interested in coming back to try a burger and more poutine."

The Gaston is jam packed with beef, sausage, gravy and cheese.  It has an old school diner feel to the restaurant. It's really damn cool. A must stop if you visit Québec city. It's my second time trying this in Québec city. Thanks for the friendly service. The Poutine Gaston is 12 bucks plus tax and it's worth every penny."

Nguyen,Thai,"2647 1ère Avevue Quebec City, QC G1L 3N5 Canada",QC,46.8360972,-71.243853,1,"We chose this restaurant due to the rave reviews but it was a huge disappointment. We expected the quality to be decent and somewhat Vietnamese due to it being a Vietnamese restaurant. Unfortunately, the entire menu appears to be more Chinese than Vietnamese. It was also in French and they do not have an English menu. There were only 2 waitresses, and the restaurant was very busy. We ordered 3 noodle dishes, one without onions. It took 15 minutes for our order to be taken and 45 minutes for the food to arrive. The portions were extremely small. We were given noodle dishes WITH onions and on one of the dish, I was given rice. The quality was awful. It tastes worse than any bad ""Vietnamese"" restaurant I have ever been to. We were really upset and hungry by then so just wanted to eat and leave. Upon paying, we complained about the super slow service and the wrong orders, only to be yelled at by both women. They said we ordered less than other people so we had to wait. I told them we would have order more if we could actually understand their menu, as they did not bother to recommend or explain any of the dishes. The women then continue to yell and scream at us. In the end, we left in anger, still hungry and full of disappointment. Overall, the customer service was absolutely horrendous and the food was terrible. Save yourself time and money and go elsewhere. Would give 0 star if I could!"

One of the highlights is the bread- it is delicious. Calamari was good but the arancini appetizer (only 2) seemed like they're using the leftover risotto without even adding cheese to the center.  Unfortunately the linguini pasta did not taste homemade and was not al dente. Pizza was decent but nothing special. Panna cotta was very sweet and pretty awful. The tiramisu was also not that great but at least not too sweet.

Service is great though. Maybe this is one of the best in the area but not for those who have traveled."

The food is definitely good, but wasn’t the best i’ve had. In terms of price, expect to pay about $30 on average for a dish, on par with other restaurants like this in the area.
Ambiance is romantic and intimate, with a dimly lit dark room and candles.

Mission accomplished, put your phone down, grab all your people and get down to La Pizzaio ASAP. Quite possibly the best pizza my wife and I have ever eaten. It redefined pizza. Seriously. Those crispy cheese corners you're supposed to ""eat like a chip"" - my goodness.

It's this tiny little place with about 6 tables, very intimate and welcoming. Everything from the mixed drinks, to the coffee, to the dessert right through to the service was absolute perfection. This will be a most stop location anytime we are in Quebec and a place I'd be proud to bring anyone.

And beyond the food, the owner and our server - that man is a national treasure, I'd come here just for the great service even if he is a Pittsburgh Steelers fan!"
La Pizzaio,Italian,"319 rue Saint-Paul Quebec City, QC G1K 3X1 Canada",QC,46.816549,-71.2122009,5,"Can pizzas leave you speechless? Go to this place and you’ll find the answer is yes. Few adjectives can accurately describe how outstanding, unique, and delicious the food is at this cozy pizza place. Marco, the owner, warmly described each dish we ordered and his companion, the chef, put love into each appetizer and pizza we had. Fresh ingredients put on top of perfectly baked, light and crispy pizzas made for an unforgettable culinary experience. And don’t forget the cocktails which were wonderful. A “wow” kind of place. Go here!"
La Pizzaio,Italian,"319 rue Saint-Paul Quebec City, QC G1K 3X1 Canada",QC,46.816549,-71.2122009,5,"One of the must places to eat from when you visit Quebec City. I have never had pizzas like this before.

i really liked the energy of their owner, he took his time in explaining us the menu and his suggestions were really good.

The complimentary starter was awesome and the pizzas also came fast and tasted really good."
La Pizzaio,Italian,"319 rue Saint-Paul Quebec City, QC G1K 3X1 Canada",QC,46.816549,-71.2122009,5,Unforgettable experience! The food is simply delicious! Marco is great super host.

La Pizzaio,Italian,"319 rue Saint-Paul Quebec City, QC G1K 3X1 Canada",QC,46.816549,-71.2122009,5,Perfect place for pizza lovers. I could have have given 4.75 stars if there was an option just because of Tiramisu proportion for the price.
Apsara,Thai,"71 Rue d'Auteuil Quebec City, QC G1R 4C3 Canada",QC,46.8105634,-71.2104556,5,An outstanding restaurant with impeccable service and delicious authentic food. It felt like we had been invited into their home and were being treated with the utmost hospitality. Loved the whole experience!
Apsara,Thai,"71 Rue d'Auteuil Quebec City, QC G1R 4C3 Canada",QC,46.8105634,-71.2104556,1,"I took my sister and niece to Quebec - I reside in New England. We were told by my (Indian decent niece) the food here was excellent. She went with my nephew who is of  Cambodian decent. She told us they arrived very late and she walked in and got seated before my nephew showed up. They raved about this restaurant so I was excited to try it when his mom and sister came out recently . I reside in New England and we took a weekend in Quebec.

When I walked in with my other niece and I spoke English to the owner,
he was pleasant in greeting me with a “welcome and looking for a table?” We saw 3/4 tables available. Then my sister walked in and spoke greetings in Cambodian out of respect. To our surprise the owner abruptly said they had nothing available and we needed to book online for another time. His whole demeanor changed as soon as my sister spoke Cambodian.

We ended up finding a little Chinese restaurant that welcomed us.

Not sure if the owner became nervous with Cambodians eating at his Cambodian restaurant, but it was incredibly disappointing. Especially given we had traveled for hours excited to try this place. I’ve never experienced such a situation. Most Cambodian restaurant owners welcome their own people excitedly since we all experienced stories of escape and starting over."
Apsara,Thai,"71 Rue d'Auteuil Quebec City, QC G1R 4C3 Canada",QC,46.8105634,-71.2104556,5,Good food. Waitress had some good suggestions.  Quick service. Will definitely return next time we are in Quebec. Strongly recommend to make reservations otherwise the crusty manager WILL turn you away
Apsara,Thai,"71 Rue d'Auteuil Quebec City, QC G1R 4C3 Canada",QC,46.8105634,-71.2104556,5,"Amazing food and Very good pricing! Very definitely recommend visiting Apsara if you're in the area. Flavors were outstanding in the 5 dishes we ordered! Prices were all around $20 per entree. Quiet atmosphere so maybe not the place for loud groups. Or maybe it was the night we went on... Either way, go visit and enjoy."
Apsara,Thai,"71 Rue d'Auteuil Quebec City, QC G1R 4C3 Canada",QC,46.8105634,-71.2104556,2,"extremely slow in serving food. I asked them when the main course gonna come, the waitress was playing phone and told me she already put in the order. That’s it….it’s been 40 minutes wait for our food. And the waitress was not even looking at me when I talk to her. She was with her phone the whole time."
Kraken Cru,Seafood,"190 Rue Saint-Vallier O Quebec City, QC G1K 1K1 Canada",QC,46.811916,-71.2346402,5,"Stumbled up this awesome restaurant when the other place we wanted to check out had a long line up, this turned out to be such a great experience. The vibe here is very chill and relaxed, we sat at the bar and enjoyed many cocktails and oysters. Servers were very friendly and the drinks and food were absolutely delicious."
Kraken Cru,Seafood,"190 Rue Saint-Vallier O Quebec City, QC G1K 1K1 Canada",QC,46.811916,-71.2346402,5,"I loved our dinner experience at Kraken Cru. It’s a small restaurant with a very attentive staff. The oysters are a must, and it was also my favorite dish on their menu. They had a great natural wine selection as well as unique cocktails. The restaurant had Brooklyn feel, which made me feel right at home. It’s a creative concept with a welcoming atmosphere."
Kraken Cru,Seafood,"190 Rue Saint-Vallier O Quebec City, QC G1K 1K1 Canada",QC,46.811916,-71.2346402,1,"Really wanted to like this place after researching oyster bars in Quebec City for our vacation. Left the restaurant upset, annoyed, and hungry. We were seated quickly, waited for drinks for 30 minutes, then asked if we wanted oysters, waited another 30 minutes until they arrived, then asked again if we wanted to order food and waited another HOUR until we had to confront our waiter if our food was coming soon and were given the wonderful response of “I suppose so?” And then after he checked, he said he “forgot to punch in the order” and that the food could be made in a couple minutes. Meanwhile he checked on our table multiple times and didn’t realize we were waiting? And all of this on a Thursday night with the restaurant half empty.

Really? Please hire competent and at minimum semi professional staff. Ruined our last night in Quebec City, ended up at a restaurant in Old Quebec with a friendly and helpful waiter and our food came out within 10 minutes of stepping inside."
Kraken Cru,Seafood,"190 Rue Saint-Vallier O Quebec City, QC G1K 1K1 Canada",QC,46.811916,-71.2346402,1,"It started as a wonderful experience, waiters were friendly, and the food was excellent. We were having a great time and a few friends joined us later in the evening and we ordered more drinks and food. Unfortunately as we paid (a bill of 1000+ CAD) the owner (I’m guessing) was extremely rude to us, I suppose blaming us for having friends join us and apparently he wasn’t happy with the huge  bill we paid at the end 🤷‍♀️ It’s a shame, it left a bad taste when it could have become a favorite spot. We won’t be going back."
Kraken Cru,Seafood,"190 Rue Saint-Vallier O Quebec City, QC G1K 1K1 Canada",QC,46.811916,-71.2346402,5,"5 stars both for the food and for the ambience.

A nice little place with a few tables and a long bar that is used for dining. There's no annoying music, allowing normal conversations in a relaxed atmosphere.

We had a dozen of deliciously fresh oysters (incl. the Jumbo ones, a rarity), and some other dishes like foie-gras and smoked sturgeon. The meals are decently priced (oysters CA$2-2.50, meals CA$12-16), and the quality is excellent. There's also a large selection of fine spirits on display, but we skipped them."

I has the Moroccan soup appetizer which was a flavorful mix of all kinds of spices and fresh herbs and chickpeas in a tomato base. The main dish was chicken and prune tagine. It was so amazing, tender chicken that was both sweet and savory with the prunes adding just the right flavor. I have never had anything like it and I am now obsessed!!!! Go ahead and try it before it gets overrun with tourists!!!"

Recommend chicken tajine with prunes, mint tea, and baklava.  BYOB, no corking fee!   Nephew of owner served us:  a genuine, helpful, patient, engaging man.  In 1987, Topeka, Kansas, high school French class they taught, ""Garcon, le billet s'il vous plait!"" as the appropriate way to ask for a bill in a francophone restaurant.  I've since learned that's a bit out-dated, borderline offensive.  Waitstaff graciously pretended not to notice my faux pas."
Un Thé au Sahara,Moroccan,"7 Rue Sainte-Ursule Quebec City, QC G1R 4C7 Canada",QC,46.8129133,-71.2119795,2,"2/5. If you are into Moroccan food then it's just an average place with mild flavors and spices. nothing special except I found harira satisfactory. Restaurent closed at 12am and we arrived at 10:30pm, pita pieces was cold dry ..upon asking to warm it a bit, server replied she can't as her chef/boss not allowing it coz restaurent is about to close. We were surprised ..since we already ordered the stuff n were soo famished we had no other choice to sit in n eat. I checked google reviews and prefer this one but i must say the food which they provide not the worth of your money."

Service overall was pretty slow since there was only one server working on a Friday night but she did a good job. The food, however, was 100% authentic. Real Moroccan flavour and for that reason alone I would go back. Staff confirmed halal status via ""oui oui"" when we asked."

I wish I could give negative points to this restaurant! Yes…salty, oily and not fresh food was really unhealthy food that we got in this restaurant! The place wasn’t clean and the woman who is working there, was very rude person! She was yelling at customers and saying get out to customers if they weren’t satisfied with their service! If you want to go to somewhere like prison, you can choose this restaurant! You will not get any respect and service in this restaurant!!!"

We tried the couscous with chicken and beef and the Lamb shanks and the mixed plate all delicious and amazing portion.

We travel and we came from Toronto, and it is hard to find good halal food, but we were lucky to find this gem, and everyone working there is so genuine.
Thank you for the amazing food. Abu and um al banat"

Saveurs du Monde,Moroccan,"847 Rue Saint-Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1R2 Canada",QC,46.8114744,-71.216606,1,"Based on my visit, I cannot recommend this shawarma restaurant to anyone. The rude and unwelcoming behavior of the lady at the counter, combined with the rushed and inhospitable atmosphere, made it clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority for this establishment. The shawarma I ordered was awful. Not only was the meat overcooked and dry, but it was also excessively salty and practically inedible. Save yourself the disappointment and seek out a different place that values and respects its customers."

Although they were also fully booked, I convinced the host that we were willing to take the table outside and risk getting rained on and boy, was it ever worth it.

The owner of the restaurant ended up serving us, and as a father himself, he was the most accommodating host we’ve ever experienced. Not only did we have the best meal we’ve had in a very long time, he graciously translated the entire menu to us in English, made incredible recommendations AND brought over a little container of toys for our toddler so we could actually enjoy our meal. This was far above and beyond what we possibly could’ve expected from a fine dining establishment like this one. I would give this restaurant 100 stars, if I could.

The food was innovative and delicious and the natural wine and beer suggestions we received were also top notch. All around just a fantastic experience. Thank you again for such a wonderful time."

The oysters were definitely a stand out! And the frog legs dish and octopus were very delightful and filled with flavour! Our favourite (or my favourite) was the dessert! It was absolutely divine! I would return just for that dessert over and over again!

We sat at the bar in front of the kitchen where we could see the dedication with which the dishes are prepared. We started with a delicious bloody mary accompanied by three dishes: fried chicken that was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, a bread with blue cheese with a subtle and salty taste and a third dish where the star ingredient was corn prepared in different ways. To finish we shared a delicious dessert ahh caramel. Everything was exquisite. Three dishes to share between two people is more than enough. Vegetarian options available. This is our second visit and we will definitely return."

The location's parking is a bit tight for the amount of venues in the location but workable.

The interior is well decorated with a rustic feel.

The selection of goods is very large from pizza to eclairs.

We ordered a sandwich, croissant (with ham and cheese), an olive bread, an ecliar, and another pastry.

All of it was great. The pastry textures were perfectly soft and creamy. The sandwiches had a crispy toast with the right amount of meat. The croissant was buttery and flakey.

The prices are a bit high but reflective of the quality of the goods.

It's highly recommended!"

What a blessing in disguise! We had personalized service by Julie who set up the entire meal, opened / poured the wine to make sure we approved, made us comfortable, and was just great all around. My husband had the beef filet, I had spaghetti carbonara, and we split a Queen Elizabeth cake and bottle of Cabernet. The food was delicious and the service was top notch. We enjoyed the Champlain food in the comfort of our room at the Frontenac. I will mention.... there is a limited menu when you order room service but there are still plenty of great choices."

We had a nice table located in the terrace area, this place had great views and lots of light. I was amazed by the old world charm. I loved the stone walls and wooden window frames, the cups and tea pot match the designs located on the ceiling (I have never seen this before)

The food tasted flavourful, and was plated exceptionally well. At first I thought the service was slow and then realized during the meal it wasn’t ever meant to be a quick experience ( I forgot it was a 5 course meal) we were completely full as there is so much food!

All the servers were friendly, explained the menu items to us and spoke both French and English.

They only offer the brunch on Sundays at this point, so I can’t stress enough to make a reservation! The price for this experience is well worth the value (We paid an additional charge for the mimosas).

Make a reservation today you won’t be disappointed!"

We got served a glass of champagne as we were seated at our table. Restaurant is decorated in a victorian vibe. Food is nicely presented and portions are fair. I was expecting a little bit more in terms of flavors though. In pictures below, there are scallops, lobster bisque, risotto and lamb steak. I can’t remember what is the green soup :p. Scallops could’ve had some extra spices. Lobster bisque is a bit on the salty side and nothing too extraordinary with the risotto and lamb steak."

There wasn’t a missed bite in any of the dishes.  Classy and inventive at the same time. Not pretentious but really fine sense of taste.  Sauces were balanced, cod and even asparagus was perfectly cook.

Best dining experience on this trip hands down.

We went a little early and the service was excellent.   I heard only two cooks and two servers in the whole place.

Good job guys!"

By far our best discovery.in Qc city.
Food was great quality, service was great and the price was very good value.
We ordered the beef carpacio by chance and it was awesome. We didn't even have time to take a picture.
We realized people raved about this dish and I can confirm it's very different and special. Perfect I would say.  Never had tried a carpacio that was so nutty and complete.
The decor doesn't do it's food justice though.
You would never expect such great food in this decor.
We love to try restos and this place is a MUST COME BACK.
The best part about this place is the fact that you may choose entree size or full size. obviously we went entree style and tried many dishes.
The fish was our favorite and will def go full course on this plate.
The caramel molten chocolate cake desert and coffee was the perfect finisher."

The atmosphere of the view of the Saint Lawrence River and the friendly staff are excellent. Considering the high price, the taste of the food was a little disappointing. Seefood casserole is a soft and rich ingredient that adds flavor. Beef flank steak is a regular steak, so it was a pity that there was no special feature. Lamb was properly baked and the meat was soft."

You're asked probably every 15 minutes by multiple people whether you are having another drink and served looks if you say no. Cocktails are small and packed with ice so they take no time to consume. There was someone barfing in the bathroom at 10:30pm probably because they force alcohol down your throat. From the review replies, the owner is an immature snarky person, so I guess that's all on brand.

Be dressed cleanly as it's attached to a nightclub and come early (around 10) to have a table. Vibe is on the formal side. Music selection is good and performers generally had good voices, but you could barely hear the person singing over the music track. The place is loud in general so if you're looking to chat, another venue might be more suitable. There was an abundance of Quebec music the night we went. It took about an hour and a half between being listed and actually singing.

Overall, I had fun! But I'm not sure this place is for me."

I ordered a medium beet and goat cheese salad, may have been the best I have had, so delicious with slightly candied pecans, superb! Hubby had the fish & chips with salad instead of fries. He said the fish was amazing with a light tempura batter. Side salad was also very good. Will definitely be back!"

Seems one waitress doing all the waiting on tables while 5 others stood behind the bar and watched...felt almost sorry for the 1 doing all the work. Took forever to get our orders in, and forever for the bill. Food was average at best, with an outdated decor/ambiene...had wire whisks from the dollar store tied together as light fixtures...lol

Restaurant Wong,Cantonese,"19 Rue de Buade Quebec City, QC G1R 3Z9 Canada",QC,46.8134597,-71.205805,5,"You will not feel like you’re in Old Quebec when you’re in this place. The aesthetics, the decor and the guzheng will make you feel like you’re in China! There’s a lady playing the guzheng, also known as a Chinese zither, which is a Chinese plucked string instrument with a more than 2,500-year history, and she plays it so well. That my friend will give the right feels and will make the place seem even more vibrant! Kudos to that lady for playing us all some really good music.
Our server was very helpful, a young man with a good knowledge about food and NFL. He suggested portions and combinations. We got egg rolls, chicken sweet and sour, chicken fried rice, chicken lowmein and vegetables with tofu. This fed four people but mind you, the portions are pretty big. My favorite out of these dishes was the chicken lowmein (yes, not chowmein but lowmein). It had a very nice texture and was flavorful. The vegetables with tofu was really good but it’s on the spicy side. We were delighted with how quick the food came and we ate like we’d never eaten before (we had a quick breakfast in the morning around 9am and were eating lunch/dinner at 5pm). We were hungry!!!
It was definitely a good choice to walk into this eatery. The toilets are clean and the place looks beautiful. It was our first time here since we were traveling to Quebec from Toronto, but when we do travel back to Quebec again, I will be going here for the food! I recommend this place to everyone. :)"

When we had booked months in advance we requested a romantic table. Maybe I should of done some research ahead of time. The restaurant is beautiful but very very tight seating, so tight that the waitresses derriere touches your table as she trys to manuevre to serve the table next to you. If they had of explained the menu a bit more in detail it would of made it easier to order. I've been to several upscale / Italian restaurants and it's typical of the server to go over the menu with you and discuss Thier featured dishes.

You can see great views of Old Quebec (including the Citadel and the Plains of Abraham) and the St. Lawrence River. The staff were nice; we had to change our reservation a little bit and the staff still accommodated us and helped us get a window-side table. The service was pretty decent. The food was okay in my view, could be better. The place was packed for brunch, so recommend booking in advance. The brunch price was pretty decent and the brunch meals were pretty filling (including a drink, appetizer, main course, and a small appetizer)."

The comment from the restaurant is really disappointing. I'm not suggesting they have discrimination. The service was poor because we understand French language (although we used English to communicate). it was obvious that we even raised our hands and waved to our waiter a couple of times, we were ignored. On top of that, they didn't take care of guest's food intolerance and lead to very bad food reaction.

The place is packed during brunch hours. I'd recommend making reservations days prior to the visit.
The view and ambience was great. It took about an hour for the whole deck to turn 1 round.
The brunch options were great.
However, the food and drink were underwhelming. The smoke salmon was way too salty.
The service was horrible to non French speaking guests. It was obvious that our waiter was much more welcoming to the French speaking guests around us while ignoring us 80% of the time.
I had food intolerance and asked to have all the sauce and salad dressings on the side.
They only put the hollandaise a side, but still served the fully dressed salad. I had really bad reaction to the salad dressings afterwards. It was painfu, caused me headache and swollen tongue. lt took me a couple hours to recover.
We also had steak and eggs. He didn't even ask us how we would like our steak.
The coffee and tea were cheap and awful. The fruit bowl was soaked in syrup. Everything was either too salty or too sweet.
It kinda put the whole experience a shame. The place was beautiful. But I was expecting a much better food quality and service."
Fanamanga,Comic Books,"650 rue Saint-Joseph Quebec City, QC G1K 3B9 Canada",QC,46.8153533,-71.2213982,5,I almost gave this store a 4 because it is not my type of style. Then I remembered the great prices for Pokemon cards for my son. I also remembered his friend bought a lot of fun items including fun socks. Finally the owner went above and beyond answering our questions. She told us that Japanese Pokemon Cards were getting delivered soon. She was easy to talk with and such a wonderful person. Just because it isn't my style doesn't mean it should lose a star. It really is a 5 star place.

If I wasn’t travelling, i would have grabbed a few bags to take with me. So soft and scrumptious! Had a salmon and pesto on a bagel with a cappuccino. Cannot complain about the service… slightly slow but that was a given because the early morning rush did not end. Was lucky to reach at a good time early morning before the big rush.

Several other restaurants on Rue St-Joseph had outright refused to make any effort to serve me anything. I was exhausted and wondering whether I would find anything to eat at all my first night in the city, when I came upon Bati. Even though I knew they would be using several ingredients in the kitchen that I am allergic to, the host, chef, and staff at the takeout counter made me feel valued and protected. Bati uses fresh ingredients and chefs cook from scratch, so although they were busy, they were fully capable of preparing a meal of spicy lemongrass beef and vegetable stir-fry with rice for me that was not only safe, but was also delicious and an absolute joy to taste. They saved me from what could have been a very sad culture of tourist health discrimination in what is considered a modern, international city. I returned the next night as well, after several more attempts to unsuccessfully order food downtown. I can't thank Bati enough for their attentive service and dedication to clean, healthy, delicious food!"

Patente et Machin,Canadian (New),"82 Rue Saint-Joseph O Quebec City, QC G1K 1W9 Canada",QC,46.811604,-71.2329437,4,"Overall, a good experience. The food was good, and all tasted very fresh and was well seasoned. We were impressed by the wine menu, a nice selection of local and French wines. The service was a bit slow, there were very few guests as we took a later seating. Everything took a long time, at least drinks were served promptly. Music was loud, and a bit distracting at times."
Patente et Machin,Canadian (New),"82 Rue Saint-Joseph O Quebec City, QC G1K 1W9 Canada",QC,46.811604,-71.2329437,5,"We went to L'Affaire et Ketchup and the server sent us down the street to Patente et Machin. The two are sister restaurants and have the exact same menu which was written on several blackboards with just the name of the main ingredient.

After serving our drinks, one of the servers spent several minutes explaining the menu in detail and answering our questions. Food was excellent, but more importantly the service was super friendly and we ended up partying with the two brother owners and the people at the next table. We were in the restaurant for almost 4 hours and enjoyed every minute of it."
Patente et Machin,Canadian (New),"82 Rue Saint-Joseph O Quebec City, QC G1K 1W9 Canada",QC,46.811604,-71.2329437,5,"This restaurant deserves a standing ovation! Walking into this cosy restaurant, we were treated with passionate and expert staff. We ordered the veal, croquettes, the crab, the scallops, and 'peasant' pudding. Recognized as a $$$ restaurant, I'm still in disbelief about how cheap the food and wine is for the quality. It's one of my favorite traditional French restaurants in France and Canada to date. The veal was cooked to perfection, the 'peasant' pudding is the crowd favorite BUT boy oh boy... the scallops plated with bloody pudding and vegetables is an example of a perfect dish."
Patente et Machin,Canadian (New),"82 Rue Saint-Joseph O Quebec City, QC G1K 1W9 Canada",QC,46.811604,-71.2329437,5,"So many options you don't know what to choose, so we wanted to try as much as we can. Ordered 3 appetizers and 3 main dishes for 3 people. It was a lot of food, all very tasty. Expect to pack food home.

Neighborhood restaurant with a big cooking talent. I would definitely come back here or try their sibling restaurants (l'affaire est ketchup, kraken cru, albacore) . Thanks again"

Laurie Raphaël,French,"117 Rue Dalhousie Quebec City, QC G1K 9C8 Canada",QC,46.8170574,-71.202684,3,"A potential Michelin?

It was quite a long wait at the doorstep before staff noticed someone was waiting there. Afterwards, it became an exciting entrance as I went straight behind the curtains opening into the kitchen where staff made a welcoming greeting and then I was ushered straight to my table.

The amuse bouche were flavourful but lacked the element to amuse. The mains were filling but nothing  extraordinary. They have an interesting mid-course bread refill with three separately served butter flavours perhaps a strategy to allocate space in your tummy. They have a unique play on their petit fours a la buffet which was set at the bar. It was an interesting tasting menu but flavour entertainment needs to be elevated.

It was a fun kitchen visit with the whole staff and the chef and managed to sneak a photo with them gladly offered by one of their staff.

Michelin Guide needs to come and visit this little restaurant in Quebec City. I've read they've never set foot in the whole of Quebec province. Maybe this'll be their first."
Laurie Raphaël,French,"117 Rue Dalhousie Quebec City, QC G1K 9C8 Canada",QC,46.8170574,-71.202684,5,"Absolutely loved this place
Fine dining “newer” style
Great team that seems to really works well together
The tasting menu was delicious
The wine pairing was a hit or miss we appreciate they journey off the beaten track but still expect the wines to be delicious or at least be enjoyable with the course (referring to the Quebec wines as these were def not our favorites)

Also 7 courses is 7 courses with 7 wine pairings unlike other restaurants in town

The friandises with the coffee or the cherry on the cake

Overall can highly recommend and hope to come back one day"
Laurie Raphaël,French,"117 Rue Dalhousie Quebec City, QC G1K 9C8 Canada",QC,46.8170574,-71.202684,5,"My wife and I had terrific dinner at Laurie Raphaël. I had reserved a table on the terrace, but asked the host for a table inside, due to the gloomy weather. Thankfully, she was able to accommodate us.

As a gastronomic restaurant, Laurie Raphaël does not disappoint. Every part of the dining experience is very well thought out and executed.

The host led us through the restaurant to our table. Surprisingly, the first part of the restaurant that we entered was the kitchen, where Chef Raphaël Vézina and his Chefs all stopped whatever they were doing and greeted us with a hearty, “Bonsoir!” The entire space is beautiful and modern.

After we were seated and enjoying a cocktail, the complete tasting menu was explained to us. My wife and I wanted to enjoy a lighter dinner on the final night of our first ever trip to Vieux-Québec, so we chose the five-course Menu Personnalisé over the full eight-course Expérience Gastronomique. I also chose to have the wine pairings with my meal.

The food was terrific; inventive and delicious. We really enjoyed the pairing of cucumber with caviar, and the textures and flavors of the lobster course were fantastic. I only wish that I had been offered some bread to soak up every last bit of the sauce. There were no missteps with any of the dishes, which were all delicious. I’ll post photos.

The wines were chosen playfully and from all over the world. I particularly enjoyed the Il Roccolo di Monticelli di Rado, which transported me back to Venice.

At first, I worried that the service would be less convivial than I prefer. The staff appeared to have clearly defined roles; some set the table, others delivered the food and others cleared the table. However, there was one gentleman who came by to introduce each course, and showed great humor when I asked him to do it in both English and then French, and, finally, both English and French at the same time.

As tourists, the only part of our meal that was lacking was a clear connection between the food and wines to the locality. We travel to eat and experiencing the terroir is important to us. I was hoping for a more clearly Québécois meal. For example, the cheese option for the dessert course was a play on carbonara; a flan of egg, Louis d’Or cheese and guanciale. While the cheese is from Québec, I felt like I was in Rome, instead of Québec.

As I said, however, this feeling is particular to us as tourists. As a gastronomic experience, our meal lacked nothing and would stand out anywhere that we have been in the world."
Laurie Raphaël,French,"117 Rue Dalhousie Quebec City, QC G1K 9C8 Canada",QC,46.8170574,-71.202684,5,"Had a lovely romantic dinner here, the service was superb worthy of 3 Michelin stars. The presentation was excellent and the flavors took you from one end of the spectrum to another in a good way. One bite delights all night with an amazing cocktail selection."
Laurie Raphaël,French,"117 Rue Dalhousie Quebec City, QC G1K 9C8 Canada",QC,46.8170574,-71.202684,5,We had a wonderful 5 course tasting menu. The service was impeccable; both the wine and the sans alcohol drink pairings thoughtfully chosen and delightfully introduced. The dishes were beautifully presented and a joy to eat.

Though we spoke French, our waitress made it a point to ignore and be rude to us. I would like to say the food made up for it, but I found my omlette to be undercooked. Not worth the $14. It is a shame because I rather support these type of businesses, but if this is the treatment for tourists....I guess I will go to the big chains."

La Girolle,French,"1384 Chemin Sainte-Foy Quebec City, QC G1S 2N6 Canada",QC,46.7943002,-71.2555189,4,"Went there as a group for my friend's anniversary. First and foremost, the service was impeccable. We were served by Sammy. He knew everything about the menu and did not hesitate to go ask in the kitchen for questions we had. Restaurant itself is elegant, the menu is displayed on a chalkboard at every table. Food itself now, it's good, but nothing special. For the price we paid we expected something better. Carpaccio starter was absolutely delicious , same for the salad and soup however the same can't be said for the main dish. Burger was a hit and miss ( better is available for half the price). Mine was half good half bad, rissoto was excellent, scallops were juicy and tender but the rest was a bit bland. Overall a good experience but I'll probably just stick to starters next time or try something different."
La Girolle,French,"1384 Chemin Sainte-Foy Quebec City, QC G1S 2N6 Canada",QC,46.7943002,-71.2555189,5,Excellent French food! The carpaccio with truffle oil is very tasty. All meals come with a soup or salad starter. Portions are generous for fine dining standards.
La Girolle,French,"1384 Chemin Sainte-Foy Quebec City, QC G1S 2N6 Canada",QC,46.7943002,-71.2555189,5,"La Girolle. What a place to feast yourself. This spot in Quebec is where you come to congratulate life on food.

La Girolle welcomes you with a vintage look and drags you in with one of the best services I have ever experienced in Canada. Then, a server will deliver an ode to the menu and recite each dish like a bard revealing the tales of the Chef and his staff.

Deciding on what you will eat after the waiter's epic monologue becomes like a life decision. The Hurt Locker has nothing against this menu.

The duck, the seafood, the crème brûlée. Wow. I do not believe in the line of judges where every single one pulls up a 10 after an Olympic performance. La Girolle is the exception. They are Olympians of food and service.

J'ai hâte de trouver une excuse pour me rendre à Québec et célébrer quelque chose à cet endroit. C'est comme ouvrir une bouteille de champagne."

The food was delicious. We tried the bison carpaccio with truffle sauce,  venison with a mushroom and rosemary sauce, seafood with a saffron-shellfish sauce, and crème brûlée. You can bring your own wine (no corkage fee)."

I am not a big fan of pizza usually, I often find it deceiving for the price, but in this case, it was 100% worth it.  The flavors were well balanced and the pizza was perfect.

Also, I have to mention the excellent service.  Even if we arrive mid afternoon between two services, we were still served quickly and the waiters were nice."
Nina Pizza Napolitaine,Pizza,"410 Rue Saint-Anselme Quebec City, QC G1K 5T2 Canada",QC,46.8122489,-71.2297665,5,"The place is very cozy and romantic. Servers were very attentive. The menu that they had from the QR code was french so we just have to understand and read the description of each item. We ordered margherita pizza and fughi (mushroom) pizza. I was craving for some mojito but they didn't have it, but the bartender made me this lemon basil drink that waa to die for. Great experience. Very safe too because they really check the vaccination status of all people dining in."

Nina Pizza Napolitaine,Pizza,"410 Rue Saint-Anselme Quebec City, QC G1K 5T2 Canada",QC,46.8122489,-71.2297665,5,"Wow! Wood-fired pizza made to perfection. A wide array of flavourful, excellently executed simple classics, inventive newcomers, and over the top mind-blowers, coupled with friendly, informative fast service, and a great location a little off the beaten path but still central mean you’ll never be disappointed. We haven’t been yet, and we’ve been back several times - both eat-in and take-out. Slightly upscale in its pricing, the menu selections and obvious incredible quality of the ingredients that Nina Pizza uses to perfection are more than worth it. Really, really, really good pizza - you won’t be disappointed. Really thin really, really good crust, easily folded to keep things squared away… so good. Though you can eat it with a fork and knife if that works for you… We’ve sampled most of the menu, and the quality and excellence are consistent across the board. Try the Margherita with Anchovies or Luca (simple, savoury, perfect)… Great job, Nina Pizza, an absolute must-visit!"
Sapristi,Italian,"24 Boulevard Champlain Quebec City, QC G1K 4H5 Canada",QC,46.812059,-71.203438,5,"Trying something different foods that I never tired before. Order a 1608 pizza. It was so delicious! Love the sauce and is thin dough and thick crust which is perfect balance/portion size. Came back few days to order Mac and cheese, it was good and glad they add something in it to taste more flavours. Cheesecake is definitely to try after meal. It way too good! English menu is available"
Sapristi,Italian,"24 Boulevard Champlain Quebec City, QC G1K 4H5 Canada",QC,46.812059,-71.203438,3,Had a couple of pizzas and beers. Margarita pizza had too much tomato sauce and barely any cheese. The carnivore pizza was good! Neither pizza came cut which was difficult do on wobbly table with a full knife. Beer wasn’t cold. So not the greatest experience. Fun to people watch on the patio!
Sapristi,Italian,"24 Boulevard Champlain Quebec City, QC G1K 4H5 Canada",QC,46.812059,-71.203438,4,"We noticed they have atleast two restaurants, this one right inside the fort wall of old town Quebec City and the other at the foothills near harbor close to Norte dam church.

Decor inside is great, modern, neat and clean. The food is palatable but nothing memorable. The service is prompt and friendly, from the host who seated us even before the restaurant opened to the wait staff, who answered all questions we had and attended us nicely. Prices are decent/modest.

We had the calamari and mozzarella sticks to start with. Calamari was standout especially because of the sauce, portions are really small for apps. Mozzarella nothing to remember was quite okaish.
For entrees we had the pasta ( pates) Sapristi, unique flavors, Pizza ( Grecque) Greek, was not a big fan of this and the flatbread margarita which was average.

Overall solid service, great decor and palatable food at decent prices sums up our experience at Sapristi."
Sapristi,Italian,"24 Boulevard Champlain Quebec City, QC G1K 4H5 Canada",QC,46.812059,-71.203438,3,"The service is longer than expected.  We ordered an appetizer but never came but they didn't charge it neither.

The food was subpar.  Felt like a tourist traps.  The pasta was nothing special. My duck confit was lack of favor and my wife's seafood pasta was ok.

Wish we have gone somewhere else."
Sapristi,Italian,"24 Boulevard Champlain Quebec City, QC G1K 4H5 Canada",QC,46.812059,-71.203438,5,We are here twice. Very good food and service. Ask to sit on back patio. Very relaxing. We ordered Carbonara and Buffalo chicken flatbread. Buffalo sauce is fairly mild.

Kimono,Japanese,"1137 Route de l'Église Quebec City, QC G1V 3W4 Canada",QC,46.769449,-71.2917205,4,First of all super fun atmosphere. Well decorated and the staff were so friendly! The miso soup was the BEST I’ve ever had. Seriously. My husbands calamari was also great. The only thing that throws me off is the sushi itself. The rolls were so so so big and the flavors were okay. I was expecting better due to the high ratings. But the prices were  good 🤷🏼‍♀️
Kimono,Japanese,"1137 Route de l'Église Quebec City, QC G1V 3W4 Canada",QC,46.769449,-71.2917205,5,"Honestly, super impressed by this place by both the food and service. It was our first time going for sushi in Quebec City (there aren’t many good Asian places here) but this one was such a pleasant surprise! I have to say, this place served the best spicy salmon roll I’ve had in YEARS. Would absolutely recommend it. We didn’t venture too too much into their special/unique options but everything we did get was super good!! I have to say that the food came a tad slow but nothing outrageous (~30 mins). Our server/bartender was super sweet and overall the place had great vibes too"
Kimono,Japanese,"1137 Route de l'Église Quebec City, QC G1V 3W4 Canada",QC,46.769449,-71.2917205,4,"A very underrated spot but known to aficionados. The food is good, fresh and lots of choices. Seatings is possible but limited. Although food can be ordered in advance, walk-ins are welcomed and a 10-20 minutes wait is too be expected depending on your order. Eating in, food is well presented and looks appetizing. Take-out is plain take out. Becareful to not shake too much your take out box, might be surprised of the result when comes to eat. Parking is difficult and sometimes a mess since it’s a residential area with no designated parking area. The staff is nice, knowledgeable and skilled. A pleasure spot for good sushi."
Kimono,Japanese,"1137 Route de l'Église Quebec City, QC G1V 3W4 Canada",QC,46.769449,-71.2917205,5,"Simply wow... Prereservation recommended, incredibly good food, attentive and friendly staff

This sushi is just magical! We were here with for people, took two starters and two mixed plates for two. Butterfish, tuna, salmon, tuna tartar, gambas, and so on... Everything was so meticulously assembled and decorated that we were very impressed!

Tap water is served free of charge from the beginning and they do have a choice of wine and cocktails to accompany the sushi. This restaurant is not a place for passersby because it isn't located in busy downtown. This means you most probably need a car - and a parking lot to get here. This might be a challenge, so may the price - but it's definitely worth it!"
Kimono,Japanese,"1137 Route de l'Église Quebec City, QC G1V 3W4 Canada",QC,46.769449,-71.2917205,2,"Definitely not a 4+ star restaurant for their food. We had already parked and were turned away from busy restaurants so we ended up at Kimono which had good reviews.

Unfortunately, the moment I set foot we already knew this is essentially a PF Chang's in Quebec city, and nothing would be authentic.

Sushi is very thickly rolled and we also ordered the fried noodles with chicken. The noodles were deep fried and drenched in ""Asian"" sauces. Easily the most disappointing meal in Quebec city. Only come if you're not looking for authentic cuisine."

Restaurant Jardin du Vietnam,Vietnamese,"260 Rue Saint-Vallier O Quebec City, QC G1K 1K2 Canada",QC,46.8121029,-71.236223,2,"I'd like to start by saying that the food was good and the portion sizes were quite large. However, I wouldn't consider it traditional Vietnamese food. It's sort of a Canadian-Vietnamese fusion kind of thing.

Be prepared for a price shock when you arrive if you consulted the menu on their website. It is not accurate. Some meals are more than 30% more expensive than the menu posted on the site.

Even though the restaurant was only half filled, everyone was corralled to the back like sardines in a can. This made it nearly impossible to hold a conversation. There was no intimacy sitting in the middle row separated by anti-COVID plexiglass.

Lastly, the lady at the front desk was VERY pushy about leaving a 15% tip on the total amount, not the subtotal before taxes. An argument ensued afterwards. In the end, after the menu pricing issue and the tip debacle, a meal for two that I expected to cost around $90 ended up at $140."
Restaurant Jardin du Vietnam,Vietnamese,"260 Rue Saint-Vallier O Quebec City, QC G1K 1K2 Canada",QC,46.8121029,-71.236223,5,This place is good and cheap for the full course menu that they give. In the beginnung they will serve you chicken soup with noodles in a small bowl. And then continued with 2 small spring rolls. And they you can choose the main course that you like. I tried the lemongrass beef with vermicelli. It was really great. The porsion is not too much but it was fulfilling for me. And that at then you can continue with tea or coffee plus 1 slice of cake. At that time it was Elizabeth cake. I recommend this place to have full course of a good meal.
Restaurant Jardin du Vietnam,Vietnamese,"260 Rue Saint-Vallier O Quebec City, QC G1K 1K2 Canada",QC,46.8121029,-71.236223,3,We ordered an entree for 2 with seafood.  We hoped for something grilled or fried but we got an extremely bland dish like Moo Goo Gai Pan which is a Chinese dish.  No flavor.  Wouldn't order it again.  I suggest that they provide menus in English so you know what you're getting.
Restaurant Jardin du Vietnam,Vietnamese,"260 Rue Saint-Vallier O Quebec City, QC G1K 1K2 Canada",QC,46.8121029,-71.236223,1,"Tried this restaurant by coincident as I was nearby when I searched for a local Viet restaurant on Google.  The décor is on odd mix of Asian and classic European.  But that's not really an issue, as I was more interested in the food experience.  That's when it became disappointing.  The food was not authentic Vietnamese, but rather a poor fusion of Viet, Thai, Chinese and even ""Canadian"".  The portions are good though.  What made the experience worst is the staff.  Other reviews have mentioned aggressive service, I do concur.  As I was nearing the end of my meal, which was about 45 mins from closing time, I witnessed a family of three come in.  They were seated by a waiter and given the complimentary tea and handed the menu.  As they were looking at the menu, the same waiter came over and told them that the kitchen was closed and they had to leave.  They were not even given the opportunity to order take-out.  They were just aggressively and abruptly ushered out!  What a demonstration of hospitality!"
Restaurant Jardin du Vietnam,Vietnamese,"260 Rue Saint-Vallier O Quebec City, QC G1K 1K2 Canada",QC,46.8121029,-71.236223,2,"Ok first it's not Vietnamese food its the weird blend of Chinese/Canadian Asian dishes that permeate Quebec.

Second service is so pushy... Said I wanted to review the menu owner/server kept trying to get me to order 1 particular Dish/combo. When I finally chased him off so I could review the menu on my own his mother (I think) came out and started pushing the same dish.

Finally ordered take out and went to sit down in the empty restaurant only to have the mother chase me outside since I ordered to go. Witnessed the same thing when another customer came in.

Gets a star basically because the portions were huge."

He is hilarious and kind. Of course the food was good too.  Homemade sausages and homemade sauce are really delicious. The veal and onion soup was really good too. The pear tart is not as good as the rum baba Typical French bistro flavour. Generous portion. Definitely recommend it. Only tiny bit to improve is the bread.

The chef seems so low key, he’s like a Michelin star chef but someone try not to be found, he cooked, at same time he served, he communicated leisurely and the food came out just on time. Pied Bleu has a seasonal menu bead on ingredients they have up-to-date, the chef will recommend! Tell him what you prefer or if you’re open to every flavor, close your eyes and pick one. You must going to miss Pied Bleu so badly when you recall the old Quebec!"

We had Guinea fowl that came with mouth watering mac and cheese. We also had the sausage plate to which you can choose to get either black pudding, white pudding or their homemade sausages.
I personally wasn't impressed with the size and price of the platters (meat and cheese), but those are very popular here.
Will definitely come back to try the brunch!"

Usually it should prompt customer to pay 10%, 15%, 20% or no tips on the POS.

What a shame!!!

The food price is also higher than the other similar Chinese restaurants.

About the food taste, it is not good as well, should be lower than the average Chinese restaurants.

I will never go back again, be aware!!!"

Not a fancy place so I was taken aback at first by the prices that seemed high to me.
We were already here so we ordered and took the food to eat in our hotel room.
Well, we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and the portion sizes.
We got Kung Pao Chicken, Singapore style noodles and beef Lo mein
The stand out dish was the Beef Lo Mein. It had such a great flavor.
We wanted to go back for lunch Saturday just for the beef Lo mein but when we went to order, we found out they (and all the other Chinese restaurants in the area) don't open until 4:00pm on Saturdays."

I had a nice lunch here (dined-in). I ordered like a crispy noodle with stir fry tofu and mixed vegetable and it was delicious. The place inside is also very cozy and relaxing. Decent prices.

Mr. Bianco, the manager, and his staff make a wonderful job in welcoming us. We had breakfast buffet, lunch, and dinner. Every meal was made to order and delicious. The salmon, the soups, the linguine, the salad, and beef dishes, just to name a few. Every single dish was cooked to perfection, and some of the items melted in your mouth. If you have room for desert, try the maple pudding (bit sweet but with a perfect bite of pudding and ice cream) is delicious.
Ask for an outside table for the views of the golf course and that perfect breeze."

My husband and I ordered a cowboy for two and our 16 years old son ordered a Kansas. When the food came, we did noticed my son’s dish had four shrimps at the top of the steak, we switched our order with our son, since he is allergic to shell fish. When we paid the bill, it showed that a Kansas for two was ordered for my son. My son said he only ordered the Kansas. We asked the waitress, she said she asked our son if he wanted a Kansas for two, she said my son said ok. We took her words and paid the bill, since the Kansas we had did have four shrimps. But when I was back to the hotel and thought about it again. I don’t understand why she asked our 16 years old son if he himself wanted a meal for two people. Additionally, our son is allergic to shell fish, he would not order the Kansas for two with shrimps which is the addition to the Kansas."

We arrived at 8:20 and the restaurant actual closing time is 10 plus she said the restaurant is full (while 3/4 was empty). Horrible place for customer service.

The downside of the restaurant is the way they make you feel rushed. They ask you to choose your dessert before you've had your main dish. They're  constantly checking to see if you've finished eating, and as soon as you're done they grab your dish and hit you with the dessert and the bill. Maybe they are trying to be efficient, but it makes you feel like they don't want you to stay very long."

Loved their sweetbreads especially. Service was great, their atmosphere was great, everything was perfect. The portions are pretty small though and it was their last call so I left hungry. I wish I would have ordered more because I am almost certain that everything else would have tasted just as amazing. I would definitely go back here."

It was truly one of a kind. Once you enter the room, you don’t see a single thing, I thought it would be a room with low-dimmed lights but it was pitch black, which made the experience much more unique. I appreciated the fact that the waiters were blind people, you don’t see that anywhere else. Last but not least, the food was good overall but the quality of it was not exceptional. You’re really paying for the experience and not so much for the quality of the food. The cocktails were bomb though. And the attention was A++++. Would definitely recommend to friends and family, and I would also like to come back someday!"

Ô 6ième Sens,Canadian (New),"1200 Av de Germain Des Prés Ste-Foy, QC G1V 3M7 Canada",QC,46.7687867,-71.287033,5,"Incredible experience! The dinner was a 9 course meal, consisting of a soup+bread to start, followed by 3 appetizers, 3 main dishes, and 3 desserts. We also chose the wine pairing option, which went well with each course. Our waiter, Christopher, was amazing, and guided us to our table slowly. He explained everything thoroughly, making sure we were all set and guiding us along the way. The food was incredible, and it was a blast trying to figure out what we were eating! It really encourages you to use your smell and all of your taste buds to decipher what you were eating! We did pretty well guessing most of the items, but there were definitely some that we were way off. It got us to try new things that we may not have tried before. Afterwards, we were guided back out to the main lobby, where the chef explained everything to us in great detail.

Overall a wonderful experience, and highly recommend if you get the chance!"

I don’t go to this kind of establishment for a beet salad, vanilla ice cream, crème brûlée or a beaver tail. I also miss their monthly themes. The concept and the staff remain great, I’m just sad to see that the new chefs may not be up to par with the chef who quit last Spring."

The beer selection is great, a good mix IPAs, stout, ales and ambers.
The food was delicious also, we had the fish n chips (substituted the chips for salads), chicken wings and poutine. Everything was delicious!
Thanks for the great service and attention which seems to have been forgotten in other establishments!
Thank you, thank you thank you 🙏🏻"

The servers were very knowledgeable and helpful with our choices. The flights are pretty big, so keep that in mind! Our personal favourite beers were the Jiminy Crick-ale and the Blanche du Lac St-Jean. The atmosphere was lovely and wasn’t too busy on a Friday night."
La Korrigane,Brasseries,"380 Rue Dorchester Quebec City, QC G1K 6A7 Canada",QC,46.8138465,-71.2268952,5,A busy yet intimanite venue. The range of beers were experimental and delicious. Shout out for the croquemitaine and generous flights serving.

Rotating options with some unusual options like a sour with pimbinas. Didn’t like them all, but decent enough. Kimchi quail eggs were tasty, tried their popular chimichurri poutine, wasn’t that into the corn/Tex Mex vibe, but maybe should have stuck to the classic! Very nice waitstaff. From the front door (at least to where google guides you) it looked empty, but everyone was seated in their back rooms and a lovely patio space outside."

We do not eat meat and this place has many vegetarian and vegan options. Many choices of food or drinks. I took the vegetable dumplings as an entree and the tofu teriyaki plate. It was veryyy good! The vegetables were fresh and tofu was cooked perfectly. Would definitely recommend to anyone, they have a lot of choices.

The service was great, very welcoming and fast. The server was a little lady who was nice, she answered all our questions and gave some recommendations for drinks 🍺 🙂 Will definitely go again!!"

I highly recommend taking the Bao Burger Chicken general tao. The fried chicken was very tender and crispy on the outside. It's the size of a regular burger so a good portion.
I also had the beef pad sew, however I found it bland and the beef was a bit dry."

We booked our reservations months in advance as we wanted to experience a highly rated restaurant during our visit to Quebec.  We are so glad we did.  The atmosphere is cool and relaxed.  The service was friendly, genuine, and knowledgeable.  Most of all, the food was absolutely delicious.  The reviews say it all.  Every dish was well thought of and composed.  The ingredients and flavours were all at once creative and comforting.  It was a meal filled with oohs and aahs.  A must visit if you appreciate food made with passion. Will definitely be back on our next visit to Quebec City.  Highly recommend!"

Samuel was very friendly and helpful with the service that made our experience much better. We dined on the patio with the street closed off and enjoyed every bite

The scallops are a must. The flavors were great, good balance of textures and tasted super fresh.

Shrimp and caviar were cooked perfectly. Pork terrine was something new for us and went well with the bread and leek butter they provided

Overall, would easily recommend this to anyone and it is well worth the trip. We walked about 30mins to get there and would do it again

Attention to detail was on point, made sure we had everything we needed but not so overcrowded. Big wine list which was a plus!"
La Cuisine,Canadian (New),"205 Rue Saint-Vallier E Quebec City, QC G1K 3P2 Canada",QC,46.8112991,-71.2272338,5,"The service was honest and helpful when looking for something to eat and drink. Their French onion soup left a sour taste, but their lasagna turned it all around. That lasagna took me back to when I cooked with my dad. When we ate dinner together. I have never had such a food to bring back memories like that. Thus why I am still giving La Cusine a 5 star rating. Would eat here again."
La Cuisine,Canadian (New),"205 Rue Saint-Vallier E Quebec City, QC G1K 3P2 Canada",QC,46.8112991,-71.2272338,5,"Came here by accident and fell in love with it! The food is reasonably priced, as are the drinks. For the midday crowd, this is a great place to do some work over a sandwich or a drink. The service is helpful, prompt, and bilingual. The decor is cute, and if you look at the photo the space behind the bar is made to look like a home kitchen! It was a little dirty on the bar (also pictured) but it was cleaned up within about an hour…I imagine they were doing cooking or prepping of some kind. I’ll definitely be coming back in the evening sometime to get a feel for the night at La Cuisine."

True enough, it did not disappoint!

La Cuisine serves comfort food. Their servings are huge — I remember telling the server, “wow, this lasagna is huge” but I ended up finishing it. 😂

Literally the best meal I had in Canada.

I must say, I was taken aback with the use of canned tuna on the nicoise salad. Additionally, I would suggest considering the combination of pear and brie as a substitute for apple in the sandwich as it adds a delightful twist to the flavor."

thank you for having such wonderful people as a blonde girl and a man with curly hair working for you. (Sorry I did not ask their names))))
They made our day on May 31st, 2023.
After a bad experience at the Le Continental restaurant, we decided to go elsewhere else and it was amazing. My husband and I were seated at a table, asked several times if everything was fine. The man offered me 2 cocktails to his taste and he was right, I really liked it. Husband wanted coffee, but we wanted not just a coffee, but special coffee 🤗😇😂. The man made him an impromptu coffee cocktail to his taste, which was not even on the menu. The atmosphere was wonderful, the food was wonderful. Special thanks for making their customers happy. we left in a great mood. I recommend the Portofino restaurant 100%.

P. S to other clients:
I never write reviews, but after having the worse experience at the restaurant “le continental” with their rude and unprofessional staff I wanted to write this review too, to let your future clients know, that your place is amazing! Thank you 😊"
Portofino,Italian,"54 Rue Couillard Quebec City, QC G1R 3T3 Canada",QC,46.8148937,-71.2092014,5,"A very good place for a family of 6 with picky kids.   We sat outside and very much enjoyed this restaurant.  We ordered Bolognese, spaghetti and meatballs, carbonara and Mac and cheese.  Dessert was shared: chocolate cake, tiramisu and creme brulee. We would come back again. When visiting Quebec City. The bread that came with the meal was the only thing that was disappointing  because I thought the portion was skimpy.   While we didn't order pizza, the wood fired brick oven looked amazing."
Portofino,Italian,"54 Rue Couillard Quebec City, QC G1R 3T3 Canada",QC,46.8148937,-71.2092014,5,"My wife and I ate dinner here our last night in Quebec! We wanted variety and the menu had that. The menu is in Italian and French! Food was amazing. The service was great! It’s is a bar restaurant so it is a little louder than your typical restaurant. We knew that but that really didn’t bother us!
They must have a connection to F1 racing as there were many items hanging in the restaurant! Highly recommend!!"
Portofino,Italian,"54 Rue Couillard Quebec City, QC G1R 3T3 Canada",QC,46.8148937,-71.2092014,5,"Came.back again after 6 years. This place has been our favorite restaurant in Quebec City. Pesto Fettuccine, Fettuccine Alfredo, and spaghetti are amazing. Tuna Tataki Salad is a must try, can't beat that taste."

When I was seated, it was not clear what the ordering system was - they have a light up cube on the table that I didn’t even notice. Finally after waiting quite a while someone came to explain. I was offered complimentary bread but it was kind of cold, however the olive oil and vinegar was a nice touch. For my meal I ordered a glass of white wine, meatballs and minestrone soup. The meatballs weren’t hot, just barely warm, which made me think they were just reheated. They didn’t taste too bad. The minestrone was delicious and I would have it again. Overall not the best experience and I expected more."

Couple of good cocktails.  Small variety of choices in food but GOOD taste.  Just a bit high on the quality/price but very well placed near the main action street of Quebec.
Jack Saloon,Burgers,"1155 Rue de la Chevrotière Quebec City, QC G1R 3J6 Canada",QC,46.8064666,-71.2171746,1,"Can't tell you about the food or drink as we felt so ignored and unwelcomed that we ended up leaving without even ordering.

We got a table and some dirty menus and that was..errr.. it. Wanting to order we looked around and raised our hand (it was noisy coz it's a bar, we get it) but the staff decided they couldn't see us even though the surrounding tables of customers could. I know invisibility is a desired super power but not when I want food.

- at no point, did anyone come and ask if we wanted to order or give us water
- when we tried to order, they would make eye contact and then LOOK AWAY
- looking around, every table had water and drinks on them except us, even the people who came in after us
- maybe it was coz we didn't speak French or because we were the only non white people in there, but no way am I paying for this kind of treatment

For our first night in Quebec, this was horrific and set a negative tone for the evening."
Jack Saloon,Burgers,"1155 Rue de la Chevrotière Quebec City, QC G1R 3J6 Canada",QC,46.8064666,-71.2171746,5,"Cosy and Rustic setting with very attentive bar staff, in fact all staff are engaging and nothing is too much.

Seriously? They literally kicked us out. How can you tell your customers they cannot have one more drink because the table is booked? I have never experienced something like this before. Shame on you jack saloon."
Poulet Portuguais,Portuguese,"203 Rue Street Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1P1 Canada",QC,46.8080084,-71.2214658,4,"Quick, basic restaurant - your order and pay at the counter, and pick up your food when the buzzer goes off. Paella was ok size for 1 person, but a bit overpriced at $20 USD. No alcoholic beverages to order, although the place seemed BYOB."
Poulet Portuguais,Portuguese,"203 Rue Street Jean Quebec City, QC G1R 1P1 Canada",QC,46.8080084,-71.2214658,5,Delicious! I particularly liked their rice with saffron and herbs. The half chicken is classic and perfectly cooked. I went with the spicy sauce on top and I loved it. Highly recommend!

Thang Long Restaurant,Vietnamese,"869 Côte d'Abraham Quebec City, QC G1R 1A4 Canada",QC,46.8125714,-71.2171135,3,"First time going to the restaurant, however had a hard time finding a parking space.

The plus point of the restaurant is that the outdoor space is quite airy and comfortable in the summer.

However, there are also quite a few minus points in terms of food and service.

Regarding the food at the restaurant, it is probably local food, so the taste of the dish is quite normal, not the original taste. In terms of service, quite slow and sluggish.

The wait for the food was quite long, the same dish but had to wait 10 minutes apart to be served."
Thang Long Restaurant,Vietnamese,"869 Côte d'Abraham Quebec City, QC G1R 1A4 Canada",QC,46.8125714,-71.2171135,4,"I ordered the pho and the thai shrimp soup. The pho isn't authentic, but it was good. The broth is tasty with little MSG since I didnt feel my tongue freeze. The beef was flavorful and tender. The noodles could be softer and more chewy. The thai shrimp soup needs more noodles, but the broth was pretty good."
Thang Long Restaurant,Vietnamese,"869 Côte d'Abraham Quebec City, QC G1R 1A4 Canada",QC,46.8125714,-71.2171135,5,"A great find for Asian food in Quebec City! My husband and came in to satisfy our Asian food craving and we were so glad we found this place. Food was delicious!

This restaurant had a 3 course meal option for the kids. Which was considerate for families whom enjoy taking their kids out to dine with them. It was a nice touch.

For the kids we ordered the potage, pasta rosée, chocolaté ice-cream with caramel. The wife had the carre agneau and I had the steak and fries.

I preferred the steak. It was cooked perfectly. The lamb was a little bit too rare but was still enjoyable.

Chocolate truffle with a strawberry purée to finish us off. Good night!"

I was looking for authentic French food outside old Quebec City and stumbled upon this hidden gem! It was our best meal of the trip — the service was amazing. Our hostess Audrey (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) was very attentive and polite. She explained the menu well (we don’t speak French) and we felt very welcomed by the whole restaurant. Ambience was very nice inside. The food and wine was top notch too! The Syrah from Spain paired very well with the food. The foie gras was amazing on the steak and potatoes. The homemade gnocchi and accompanying vegetables were delicious, as well as the creamy sauce. The beef tartare as appetizer was delicious! Thank you for a wonderful experience."

Hosaka-ya,Japanese,"491, 3e Avenue Quebec City, QC G1L 2W2 Canada",QC,46.8230326,-71.2268553,4,"Good little japanese restaurant in town. The fishes are tasteful and reasonably priced. Not like sushi in Japan, mainly the rice, but I think it is going to be one of the best in town."
Hosaka-ya,Japanese,"491, 3e Avenue Quebec City, QC G1L 2W2 Canada",QC,46.8230326,-71.2268553,2,"We were there a couple of days ago. When we entered, only one table with 4 people inside. After the waiter's clear introduction, we ordered our sushi and a combination of combos. Then we had waited for around 45 mins to get our miso soup. At then another half an hour, finally our sushi arrived. The taste was okay, not bad but not very good either. However, we were very unsatisfied with the speed at which the sushi was served. We know good sushi takes time to make, but more than one hour was far too long. I was making jokes by telling my friend maybe the fish was still swimming inside, so the waiting time was long. I personally don't recommend this restaurant to people who are hungry. But if you have plenty of time or want to talk with your family and friends before meals, then it might be a place to go. Originally I would just leave 1 star for this restaurant, but add 1 more to the friendly waiter."
Hosaka-ya,Japanese,"491, 3e Avenue Quebec City, QC G1L 2W2 Canada",QC,46.8230326,-71.2268553,5,Excellent japanese food at a moderate price. I recommend it to every one.

There are a few around but we end up here. I have order uni sashimi and maki rolls. Absolutely fresh and delicious! The manage is very nice and love their interior with a corner that selling small Japanese goods.
Hosaka-ya,Japanese,"491, 3e Avenue Quebec City, QC G1L 2W2 Canada",QC,46.8230326,-71.2268553,5,"Very friendly service and excellent flavorful food! We went at lunch and didn't see ramen on the menu, so in case you are looking for that, keep that in mind. Loved the quail eggs in soy sauce."

Shady,Lebanese,"1680 Avenue Maufils Quebec City, QC G1J 2H7 Canada",QC,46.8375194,-71.2217308,2,"From the reviews i had big expectations, very disappointed. 2 stars, because it was still edible.
1. Not authentic lebanese.
2. The meat and the potatoes were dry.
3. Veggies and rice were way too sweet?
4. The seasonings are not what you expect from the shishtaouk and lebanese rice.
And the most importantly the garlic was non existant in the fake GARLIC SAUCE, it was garlic mayo...
For some who dont know what its supposed to taste like it might pass, for the rest of you i wouldn't recommend."

There is a lot of choice for the beer and the quality is really good! The waiters know a lot about their menu and give good advice about the beer! A good place to taste good beer at a fair price!

Griendel,Brasseries,"195 Rue Saint-Vallier O Quebec City, QC G1K 1J9 Canada",QC,46.8117603,-71.2348989,4,"My husband and I were not sure about the place and so we split our two meals and didn’t get a side either but let me tell you...

The burger was delicious and I was sad to only got to eat half of it! That tells you how yummy it is! I immediately told my husband I would 100% come back to eat it whole!

The poutine was really good, great cheese and great sauce -however, wouldn’t recommend getting the pulled pork on it! 🙅🏻‍♀️The pulled pork took away from the amazing poutine!

Just a regular poutine is the best! 💁🏻‍♀️

Lastly, the beer, my husband wasn’t a fan but many seem to love it so maybe he just didn’t pick the right ones? 🤷🏻‍♀️

Def good food!"

They did not give my money back when I told them they served me food that looked like garbage. It has ruined my day, I’m so upset. They served a piece of lettuce with cheese on top and gross fish on top. It was gross looking, I would never eat anything like this. This is the worst service and the worst food I have ever seen."

La Cage Brasserie sportive,Diners,"837 Rue Clemenceau Quebec City, QC G1C 2K6 Canada",QC,46.8674486,-71.2077233,5,"La Cage is one of the coolest sports bars I have ever been to. This Quebecois sports bar chain was one of the most memorable experiences I will have in Montreal. Their ginormous variety of pub food includes burgers, chicken wings, ribs and loaded nachos. Every item is stellar and a good size for a hardy meal. The atmosphere of La Cage is unlike any other sports bar I have ever seen. Walls filled with old unique sports memorabilia, huge TV’s, base ball bats everywhere, which ultimately gives the bar a slick retro feel. La Cage is an amazing place to watch a sports game with a group of friends, or simply have a great night filled with great food, and loads of fun!"

Kids meal was not very appealing at all.  Didn’t take a photo of the spaghetti bolognese, as it was quite bad.

The appetiser platter wasn’t very good as well.  The chicken strips was cold and mushy.

Salmon tartare was average.
Burger was the best item we’ve had."
La Cage Brasserie sportive,Diners,"837 Rue Clemenceau Quebec City, QC G1C 2K6 Canada",QC,46.8674486,-71.2077233,5,Nice atmosphere and free popcorn! The Roasted Salmon Fillet was really good!

Sushi Samurai,Japanese,"337 Rue Saint-Paul Quebec City, QC G1K Canada",QC,46.816452,-71.2127049,5,"We were craving sushi while visiting Quebec City and there are only a handful of AYCE options. This one had some conflicting reviews so we were hesitant, but ultimately decided to take the risk - and glad we did.

We arrived at the end of the lunch pricing, so we felt a little rushed to get all our food done in one order, but our server asked multiple times later if we wanted any more food so I think it would have been fine

What we got was delicious and fast. A bit smaller than we anticipated, but well presented. The service was (overly) friendly and the location is central and accommodating. Fear not by the other reviews and visit this gem 🍣"
Sushi Samurai,Japanese,"337 Rue Saint-Paul Quebec City, QC G1K Canada",QC,46.816452,-71.2127049,2,The place is chaotic.  There's only one server and the owner works at the till. The food is ok. I thought it was a gem as they seem to be very busy. Their card machine stopped working so we have to pay by etransfer as we don't carry cash. You can see peoplw getting bored waiting for their food. Babies crying here and there. You can use their order slips to draw and sketch with the pencil while waiting for your order.
Sushi Samurai,Japanese,"337 Rue Saint-Paul Quebec City, QC G1K Canada",QC,46.816452,-71.2127049,5,"Nice AYCE (all-you-can-eat) Sushi close to Old Quebec

This restaurant is located right across from Gare du Palais, the old train station, and a beautiful Place Jean-Pelletier park with a beautiful fountain. It’s about 10 minutes walk to the Old Quebec.

It was our first time back to this place since the Pandemic, the food is still quite decent, ingredients fresh, tempura light and crunchy, donburi deliciously prepared.

You can definitely tell the effect of the Pandemic though, there was only one person serving multiple tables (he did an excellent job though), one lady guarding the cash register, so some dishes took a while to come out, all very understandable.

Price was up a bit as well, $35.99 for adults and $24.99 for kids 4-11, babies eat for free.

There were 8 of us, and they were super accommodating to seat our booth tables together, without a reservation. We had an excellent family meal.

Recommend to someone with a good appetite!"
Sushi Samurai,Japanese,"337 Rue Saint-Paul Quebec City, QC G1K Canada",QC,46.816452,-71.2127049,4,"Very good buffet , I recommend the place , rice was moist didn’t have a problem with any of my order ! Enjoy the dishes that I was served!
Went there on a busy Wednesday and unfortunately they were short staff but the two waiters , 1 cook and 1 dish walker really worked like machines! Props to them from keeping the place functioning with their hands full"
Sushi Samurai,Japanese,"337 Rue Saint-Paul Quebec City, QC G1K Canada",QC,46.816452,-71.2127049,1,"Go here only if you aren't hungry and if you have all evening to burn. It took 2.5 hours to get all our food and the clientele didn't change all night because everyone was in the same boat. The food was good but there was no wasabi nor ginger and we got random food throughout the night rather than what we ordered (but we weren't going to complain; we were just happy to get SOME food). The one waiter kept apologizing all night but based on other reviews, this is the standard here. This place made us swear to check reviews before committing."
Café au Temps Perdu,Modern European,"867 Avenue Myrand Quebec City, QC G1V 2V8 Canada",QC,46.7875573,-71.2682816,5,"We had the fish and chips and the vegetarian pizza. Both were really nice but what makes the place jumping is the cosy atmosphere. Great place to chill in summer evenings.

Service is brisk and attentive, and bilingual. People usually come for the beer but the coffee is amazing too"
Café au Temps Perdu,Modern European,"867 Avenue Myrand Quebec City, QC G1V 2V8 Canada",QC,46.7875573,-71.2682816,4,"I love coming back to this well-established spot with long-time friends. It's a perfect place for warm conversations over coffee, beer, wine and snacks. Also a great place for a date! The decoration is warm and elegant without being artificial. The patio is often crowded during the summer. It's possible to have a full dinner, but note that the food menu is more limited than at typical restaurants."
Café au Temps Perdu,Modern European,"867 Avenue Myrand Quebec City, QC G1V 2V8 Canada",QC,46.7875573,-71.2682816,4,"Wonderful place. Warm, friendly, great ambiance without the booah. From quick snacks to lots of beverages (unfortunately not so much on juices). Lots of seatings and zones set ups, from two seaters, couple to friends get-together tables (5+). This review is on an off school season (an university is next door). Prepare for long lines or reservations wait when school is in session."
Café au Temps Perdu,Modern European,"867 Avenue Myrand Quebec City, QC G1V 2V8 Canada",QC,46.7875573,-71.2682816,3,"Stopped here for a quick dinner with my wife. The atmosphere is nice and the chairs are comfortable. The nachos are decently covered with toppings, yet is a bit small for sharing with larger parties. The veal burger was not bad, if a little on the salty side; the fries were extra crispy yummy and the salad was delightfully surprising. The vegan chili is disappointing, as it was more rice than actual chili; the fried tortilla that went with the chili was enjoyable. A major note of improvement is, the serving staff could be somewhat friendlier; but, who knows, everyone has those days."
Café au Temps Perdu,Modern European,"867 Avenue Myrand Quebec City, QC G1V 2V8 Canada",QC,46.7875573,-71.2682816,5,We had a large group for a celebration of life.

Highly recommend! Even when busy it’s still really nice and calm."

Great coffee as well and the perfect way to start the day.

If you ask they do have an English menu available, although the staff was very accommodating with our limited French."

If you happen to be in Quebec City you probably should have a brunch here. I really cannot remember the name of each food cos they're in French but most of them are really good (i've attached some pictures so you'll know what it looks like).

Chez Boub,Burgers,"840 Boulevard du Lac Quebec City, QC G2M 0C9 Canada",QC,46.9312889,-71.3132908,3,"Interesting family type restaurant.  Ordered lasagna and Italian poutine and spaghetti.  Served hot. Lasagna not bad but the sauce lacked taste. Beef but no other meat in serving.  Cottage cheese missing. Melted mozzarella on top. Good portion for petit. Italian poutine had large fries, but cheese curds cold in center almost taste thawed from freezer. Beef sauce on top.  Spaghetti good portion but sauce was just Beef and tomato.
All 3 dishes used the same sauce topping which was unexpected and disappointing.
Washrooms in basement and were unisex and were 4 toilet stalls. All 4 stalls were dirty and left without using any. Sad  cleanliness for a family restaurant.
I will not be returning and not to my liking or expectations on cleanliness."
Chez Boub,Burgers,"840 Boulevard du Lac Quebec City, QC G2M 0C9 Canada",QC,46.9312889,-71.3132908,5,"We heard so many good things about their poutine, and it is ALL true! I had the medium lobster poutine at 22$ and my boyfriend got a big super Boub at 20$. The food was sooooo good, I loved the quality of the fries and the fresh cheese. Gravy was soooo good and in the right quantity! Overall is a great place to eat with amazing food and lovely environment. We will certainly return to try the rest of the menu (that is huge). 100% recommended!"

Chez Boub,Burgers,"840 Boulevard du Lac Quebec City, QC G2M 0C9 Canada",QC,46.9312889,-71.3132908,4,"Great family friendly place to stop and eat. Easy to get a table. Indoor play structure kids loved while waiting for food and and even better one outside they played with after. Definitely a great place to stop and stretch legs. For food, the pizza we got was fantastic. If you get a medium you can get two flavours. We tried Carbonara and Portebello - we leaned towards Portebello as the better one with the truffle oil putting it over the top. Amazing fresh crust. Kids said their burgers were ok. Their fries appeared to be frozen fries, they did not finish them. They include a tiny drink for kids meals but charge $2 extra for more. Next time we would just get the kids pizza ! We will definitely go back when in the area, but only for the pizza !"

Le Varadero,Cuban,"189 Rue Saint-Joseph Est Quebec City, QC G1K 3A8 Canada",QC,46.812799,-71.2287209,4,"Was excited about a Cuban restaurant in Quebec city.  The entrance looked interesting as it looks like a full corner bar. But once you pass that, you see seats and a bar counter to eat at.

The staff was very nice and friendly.

The service was extremely slow. They did apologize as they knew it was slow because they had quite the amount of Uber eats/skip the dishes meals ahead of us and they were short staffed.

The food itself reminded me of being in Cuba itself. Certain things were a tad bit salty but nothing out of the ordinary.

Overall, good place, good food and best part was that it was open late (we left at 1am and they were still accepting orders.)"
Le Varadero,Cuban,"189 Rue Saint-Joseph Est Quebec City, QC G1K 3A8 Canada",QC,46.812799,-71.2287209,5,This place is small but awesome. The security guards of the place are very nice and welcoming. They have good music to dance and good drinks. I feel the place is so successful that they should try to expand it cause many people want to go. I recommend you this place that is thought for the Latin community or people that love dancing and having a fun time.

From the moment you enter you'll be charm by the warmth of the small bistro and their wonderful service staff. The menu is ever changing based on the season and the chef inspiration but there is a few classics you HAVE to try like their out of this world blood pudding or the risotto that will ruin all the other risotto for you or the shortbreads that will convince all the non believers. Local products, great ambiance, a wine selection for all wallet, service that makes you feel at home sizes and a view on Quebec city that will leave you breathless, you can't get better than the Grain de Folie"

While in Levis on vacation from Ontario we googled suggested restaurants and Au Grain De Folie came up in our results with a 5/5 rating. We can now say ourselves in full confidence that Au Grain De Folie is the perfect 5 star experience. The restaurant is a small and intimate setting. We highly recommend making a reservation as it was not uncommon to watch people being turned away at the door due to max capacity.

Our only regret is that we didn't discover it sooner. We were treated like part of the family. For those like ourselves that only speak English, the staff was more than willing and able to accommodate.

Do not give up the opportunity to try this place.

To the people at Au Grain De Folie, we thank you for a wonderful Québec experience,

Dave and Cody"

Service was nice and friendly. The maquereuse was great. The wines by the glass were good, reasonably priced, and they let you taste to check it was to your liking.

Only downside was the street noise."
Sushi Kumi,Sushi Bars,"101-815 Boulevard Lebourgneuf Quebec City, QC G2J 0C1 Canada",QC,46.8404992,-71.2820304,5,"Be sure to grab a reservation, i got very lucky that there was space for me (1 person) the food is incredible but what is even more astounding is the speed at which they pump out the food.
You choose what you want to eat and after taking the order the food is usually there within 5 minute if you dine alone and a little bit more if you are in a group.
The food is fresh and you can tell they dont use anything frozen (fried foods)
I heavily recommend the sashimis and the fried banana (photo attached)."

Oh noooo, once we arrived, it was pack, and thinks it's a great sushi place, after being seated, got the menu full French, server came and explained, than we finally realized it was a ayce sushi place. It have a good variety of cook food, pizza salmon, udon, fried rice, ok selection for sushi, salmon, tuna, egg, Pollock, spicy salmon, tofu, avocado, fake crab meat, octopus, eel, and shrimp. For sashimi they added squip. the BIG BUT, the rice in the sushi are as big as the fish, the fish overall we're good, really the rice destroyed us. We didn't have the chance to order the cook food, but the fried scallop have no taste. We over stuff ourselves on rice, and you have to finish every piece or else they'll charge you 😭😭😭"

Quality of the sushi rice was too cooked and the fish was smelly

Sadly, it didn't quite live up to our expectations. None of the pastries we ordered were fresh, and that left us feeling quite disappointed.

In the past, we've been impressed with the quality of their pastries at the other location, but this time, it seemed like they missed the mark.

Positives: The service is friendly and quick. Lots of parking available and clean washrooms."

But, on the other side, i ordred an other combo breakfast with some hot beverages, to my surprise It was prepared and left on the counter no one told us it was ready or they do not do so or anything... I would have given a one star for this but the pizzaiolo did such a great work he made me change my mind."

Friendly greeting followed with a wide variety of Greek food on the menu. Children's menu was perfect and a great value for what you get. The next big value was the table d'hote menu, great choices; The salmon was spot on. The brochettes were also very good; we went with the beef, pork and chicken combo. Cooked just right.
Would love to comment on dessert, but we were too full. Maybe next time around! 😉"

The place itself had a nice vibe but my friend and I got harassed in front of the staff and no one came to help us or check if we ok.
We were sitting at the bar minding our own business while an older man came and harassed us for being Jewish. The place wasn't packed and people could hear what was happening yet ignored it completely. I never felt this unsafe and had to leave quickly after getting there.
I could not recommend this to anyone as the staff clearly do not car about the safety of the customers."

We were sitting at the bar minding our own business when an older man came and harassed us, At the beginning he just asked as where we are from (Since it was clear that we were tourists) but then it become very uncomfortable, The place wasn't packed and people could hear what was happening yet ignored it completely, My friend had to ask a random guy multiple times for help until he came to help and ask the man to leave us alone. The man came back just to add extreme racist and antisemitic comments, making me feel unsafe while non of the staff who witness came for help. (The guy harassing us was one of the musician staff, not just a customer), I would never recommend this to anyone as you can not be safe as a women or as a minority group.

La Revanche,Cafes,"585 Charest E Quebec City, QC G1K 3J2 Canada",QC,46.8140817,-71.2218403,5,"My friends and I went there and it was great. Don't worry if you still can't speak french, all the staff can help you in english and they can explain the game in english too. Basically, once you are on the table, you can order drinks or food and then the game master will come to your table to ask what games you prefer or they can give you recommendation. Then they will exolain to you about the game's rule. The atmosphere was pretty nice. I'll go there again for sure."
La Revanche,Cafes,"585 Charest E Quebec City, QC G1K 3J2 Canada",QC,46.8140817,-71.2218403,4,"Open late and was near our accommodation which made it convenient! Service was a bit slow once we got seated but they were really nice despite a bit of a language barrier. The food was okay but the drinks were really good. It costs $8 to play games, the game masters were really well versed and super helpful when recommending games for groups! Great late night hangout for friends and was super busy too on a weeknight!"
La Revanche,Cafes,"585 Charest E Quebec City, QC G1K 3J2 Canada",QC,46.8140817,-71.2218403,4,A great place to play games and discover new ones. It’s useful that the place has a couple of game grandmasters 🙂 who can recommend you new games based on what you already like.
La Revanche,Cafes,"585 Charest E Quebec City, QC G1K 3J2 Canada",QC,46.8140817,-71.2218403,4,"Fun board game cafe. We came during off-hours and there was only one employee. Despite that, he took great care of us and made good recommendations from the menu. He wasn't super knowledgeable about the games, but I was told the game experts are only there during the busier times. Regardless, they had an excellent selection and we stayed for a few hours and enjoyed ourselves."

Had breakfast twice during my stay, once the breakfast buffet which had a good selection of hot and cold items, fresh fruit and breads for 25.00. Other day ordered off the menu.

Decent hotel eatery.."

The breakfast was my favourite part about my stay at this hotel - you can choose between a $21 buffet, or order regular brunch (egg Benedict, omelette, etc.) on the menu at less than $20. The environment was very quiet at 7 am on weekdays, with a lot of empty seats and caring waiters."

The restaurant was very energetic and vibe-y and the service was excellent. From John the host through to Cameron the bartender and Amir our waiter, we were very well taken care of. The staff were friendly and the food and drinks were exceptional. We did the Butcher’s Feast, which was a perfect sampling of various different cuts of steak, all of which were beautifully tender and flavourful. The side dishes were also all very tasty and complemented the balanced flavour of the meat, which was allowed to shine without too many sauces or help from spices. Definitely recommend and would absolutely go back!"
Table,Breakfast & Brunch,"395 Rue de la Couronne Quebec City, QC G1K 7X4 Canada",QC,46.8145239,-71.2246204,2,"We went for dinner and breakfast.
The breakfast was very good and that's why I gave an extra star. Try the Duck Benedict if you ou can it's delicious.
The dinner however was a disaster. Service was awfully slow, from greeting us to talking orders to refilling drinks to everything. We ordered plain macaroni for one kid and it arrived full of cheese (they fixed it)
It was wing night and no wings available (clever marketing), the tuna tartare was tasteless; I needed to pour a ton of Sriracha to give some flavor.
The maple Sriracha and pork belly bites was excellent. The steak was good but the salad very standard.

Go there for breakfast but skip for dinner!"

The orange rice with beef cube (Bo Luc Lac) is a little pricey and quite sweet to me, the rest are fine.

Cold water does not taste right, it is like not wash well, has the taste of desinfectant. I pay the tips, but I have to clean the table by myself and bring the bow and plate to the counter....food court quality and service with expensive price.
I do not recommend."

The food is delicious, five stars, but the service is zero. I won't be guided to my seat. There are a lot of staff, no one paid attention to us. Serve to local customers seemed to be the top priority. Foreign customers like us who are left behind by staffs' chatting with local customers.

A bill of nearly $100 We appreciated the shells by adding our marinara sauce, it was missing... For the rest it was not very tasty.

On the other hand, the price is sometimes high for basic dishes. Example, a dish of Chinese macaroni $18, a lasagna $18.75 for a square dish about 9"" Unfortunately, this one was tasteless. I have no problem paying $20-25 for a dish that doesn't ask me any preparation, that's my goal when I buy everything ready to save me time. I have a little more difficulty paying this price when I have to mess around and it doesn't really save me time. That said, this is not bad! Everyone has their own needs :)"

Our party of 4 had the pulled chicken sandwich, risotto, Mac and cheese, corn dogs, onion rings, French fries, salad and soup and everything was delicious. I just wish we had had room for dessert. Perhaps the best compliment is that my three non-celiac dining companions all agreed you would never know we were eating 100% gluten free.  The owner and staff were super friendly too."

Baguette & Chocolat,Cafes,"36 Côte de la Fabrique Quebec City, QC G1R 3V3 Canada",QC,46.8144716,-71.2078184,5,"We had a wonderful experience! Delicious drinks and food - we especially loved the mochaccino, chocolatine, and crepe traditionelle. We sat by the window and the breeze coming through was very pleasant.

The man at the register was very friendly, greeting and thanking guests. He was kind when I tried ordering in my horrible french, even though he can speak english. Gave me a boost of confidence in addition to a delicious brunch. Glad we stopped by!"
Baguette & Chocolat,Cafes,"36 Côte de la Fabrique Quebec City, QC G1R 3V3 Canada",QC,46.8144716,-71.2078184,5,"This place was one of the highlights to our vacation. Danny, the person taking orders up front was one of the nicest people we met in Quebec City. Not only did he speak English well but he's fluent in Spanish also.  The coffee, mocachino, hot coffee and the pastries are awesome. If I could only have eaten one thing in Quebec City, it would have been the almond croissants which were filled with a buttery, sugary, almond sauce that caused us to go there 2 of the 3 days in Quebec for breakfast and we took home 3 extras.  Wow!  Don't miss it.  Best spot! And the crepes were out of this world too."
Baguette & Chocolat,Cafes,"36 Côte de la Fabrique Quebec City, QC G1R 3V3 Canada",QC,46.8144716,-71.2078184,5,"Fantastic bakery, went on the first morning of our Quebec City visit and loved it so much, we returned two more times! It was our favourite stop for delicious pastries, crepes and specialty coffees. On top of that, the service was exceptional, the gentleman at the cash was a dynamo, working hard to clear the line with a smile and switching from English to French with admirable ability. The pastries were airy and light with perfect taste and texture. The crepes were perfect and light with delicious fillings, sweet or savoury and the lattes/cappuccinos were fantastic! The Iced maple latte was a favourite! The sandwiches, including the capicola, the tuna and the croque monsieur, were fabulous, on delicious fresh bread/buns and priced affordably for a lunch takeaway, a bonus thing for busy days walking the city. Centrally located right by City Hall, this is a must go for all visitors! There are tables inside and also a few sidewalk tables."
Baguette & Chocolat,Cafes,"36 Côte de la Fabrique Quebec City, QC G1R 3V3 Canada",QC,46.8144716,-71.2078184,5,"While we were in Quebec on vacation, we tried Baguette & Chocolat our first morning there. After that, this place was our first stop every single day.

The gentleman at the register (who I believe was the owner) met us every morning with a smile, a friendly demeanor, and was helpful in assisting us to decide what we wanted. The rest of the staff were friendly as well.

The crepes were fantastic and were very large portions. Honestly, my wife and I could have probably split every crepe we ate and been full, but we always wanted to try as many different things as we could. The ""Western"" crepe was one of my favorites. All of the coffee variations that we tried were bold, flavorful, and affordable.

If you're looking for a daily stop to get great coffee, fresh and tasty crepes, baked goods, and a nice atmosphere in downtown Quebec, put Baguette & Chocolat on your list."
Baguette & Chocolat,Cafes,"36 Côte de la Fabrique Quebec City, QC G1R 3V3 Canada",QC,46.8144716,-71.2078184,5,Had savory breakfast crepes here. Excellent breakfast choice. I will return if I am around the town next time.
La Grolla,Fondue,"815 Côte d'Abraham Quebec City, QC G1R 1A4 Canada",QC,46.8126006,-71.2176124,4,"Food was very good and tasty.
I had the Chinese fondue with beef and cheese cubes. Overall no complaints. The service was good and attentive. Prices were reasonable. Its a little out of the way and not near the main vibe so it's pretty quiet and not exactly a hip or happening place but like I said the food was good."
La Grolla,Fondue,"815 Côte d'Abraham Quebec City, QC G1R 1A4 Canada",QC,46.8126006,-71.2176124,5,"Delightful experience on a very cold day in Quebec! We all got the trio and I had the seafood, hubs got the beef- excellent and fresh! The dessert was a but disappointing. I don't think it's pictured. We chose maple instead of chocolate. It was a plate of fruits and marshmallows- with a ramekin of maple dipping stuff- so not a heated fondue experience- plus the presentation lacked, left something to be desired. Our waitress was funny, kind and helpful. Overall a fun experience and dinner. Btw- they did not instruct how to do anything- so cooking times were determined on your own at your own discretion."
La Grolla,Fondue,"815 Côte d'Abraham Quebec City, QC G1R 1A4 Canada",QC,46.8126006,-71.2176124,5,"We all had the trio fondue plate, and oh my delicious from the first bite to the last. There was plenty of food. Excellent service, with a sense of humor. We highly recommend ordering these delicious dishes. We started with an awesome cheese fondue, followed by the traditional Chinese fondue and ended with a yummy chocolate fondue, with the perfect amount of sweet. 😋 Don't hesitate 😉 this restaurant is definitely worth trying. With a charming atmosphere, reasonable prices, and fantastic food."
La Grolla,Fondue,"815 Côte d'Abraham Quebec City, QC G1R 1A4 Canada",QC,46.8126006,-71.2176124,5,"Cozy atmosphere and decor. We got the triple fondue set (cheese & baguette, broth & beef, chocolate & fruit), and it was filling and delicious."
La Grolla,Fondue,"815 Côte d'Abraham Quebec City, QC G1R 1A4 Canada",QC,46.8126006,-71.2176124,3,"During our visit to Old Quebec, we visited La Grolla for their fondue. While the Chinese fondue had a great savoury flavour, the quality of the meat was not very high. In addition, the portions for both the Chinese fondue and cheese fondue are quite small. Definitely pricey and not very filling."
La Piazzetta,Pizza,"1191 Avenue Cartier Quebec City, QC G1R 2S9 Canada",QC,46.8028996,-71.2242526,5,Our first meal in Quebec and it didn’t disappoint. Pizzas have excellent flavors without getting too heavy. Lobster pasta is also very tasty.
La Piazzetta,Pizza,"1191 Avenue Cartier Quebec City, QC G1R 2S9 Canada",QC,46.8028996,-71.2242526,5,"I came here on a date while travelling. I don't speak French at even a conversational level, but the waiter and waitress were extremely friendly, welcoming, and accommodating in English.

The restaurant was quiet and warm, the music was ambient and unobtrusive. In terms of atmosphere and decor, it felt like a very fancy, high-end restaurant, but the prices were moderate and affordable.

For an appetizer, we had the Snails and Camembert Gratin. The snails were delicious and tender, the camembert was gooey and cheesy, and the gratin had a nice basil flavour. It came with some crunchy, toasted bread which was delicious on its own. I almost wish there was a bit more bread to soak up the leftover sauce because it was so tasty.

My partner had the Mushroom and Black Garlic Cream Pasta. It came with some more of the crunchy toast. The noodles were soft and thick, it had a creamy sauce and a very generous helping of large, meaty mushrooms.

I had the Pizza Burger, which was not like I was expecting, but way better than I could have imagined. It had a toasted, cheesy outside and a creamy inside with delicious spinach and thick meaty burger. Piping hot and juicy.

Overall, an amazing restaurant and highly recommend. All of the ingredients are locally sourced, too, so it felt like a perfect capstone for our trip to Quebec."
La Piazzetta,Pizza,"1191 Avenue Cartier Quebec City, QC G1R 2S9 Canada",QC,46.8028996,-71.2242526,4,"The service is friendly, the pizza is tasty and the dessert are so good. All is met to enjoy a great diner. Try it you will like it!"

It was fun that the restaurant highlighted menu items as ""incontournable"" or ""must try"" items. The lounge style music was great and the atmosphere was very good. The servers were very friendly. We found the service slightly on the slower side. They did not pick up on cues that our kids were getting a little restless and we were itching to pay and leave at the end of our meal either, but they responded well when we asked to wrap up."

Ordered the seafood pizza and the procuto pizza. Both were bad. We bought we would give it another try and try another one the pulled pork hawaian. It was bad too. No flavour no taste.

I am English speaking but was able to get an English menu and communicate with the server in English.

I had the best. Flambe cheese. Filet mignon was served on a hot rock and cooked in front of me along with the shrimps and scallop.

Food presentation was amazing and the price was very fair for the quality of food, presentation and a bottle of wine.

They had a live band and the singer was great. I highly recommend a stop at this restaurant."

La Pizz,Italian,"3A Place Royale Quebec City, QC G1K 4G3 Canada",QC,46.8131058,-71.202752,1,"I have nothing good to say about this restaurant, if I could rate it zero I would. Our waitress “Anne Laure” was rude and unfriendly. Everything was charged extra… to share (3$), remove toppings (4$) and the bread too. Our drinks were 4.50 for a can with a straw in. The pizza was very thin and all toppings were placed to one side as well as they wouldn’t cut the pizza because of equality. Excuse me??The base was uncooked as well…

Reply to owner…
The prices wouldn’t have been an issue if it wasn’t for the terrible service and uncooked food that was average at best.
If you can’t take the criticism you shouldn’t be in the business industry.
Why should I be sympathetic? I payed good money for a professional chef to serve me raw dough. You tell me to go have a picnic as if I could have known there would be such bad service and food."

The fried chicken was not bad. It came close to KFC  (PFK in Quebec), but they only use 9 herbs and spices as compared to 11 for PFK. The chicken was much smaller and genetically modified as it is in the U.S.
Unfortunately the pizza did not hold up to my standards. They’re website did not allow you to remove olives and the pizza tasted bad because of the olives on the pizza."

Placed in a non typical foody neighbourhood, thus restaurants is located in a nice intersection with a lot of trees and beautiful sights. It's stand in a class of their own.
Decor inside is modern, clean and classy with similar colors and beautiful paints on the walls. Second floor has a balcony and a nice terrasse all around de lower level give it a romantic atmosphere in summer time.
Service was awesome, a lot of people around you being sure you are ok at all times.
Food was very good with a good variety and the portions are generous. Also, you can find the right wine to match your food.
Only thing was though, in the second floor the A/C system was not so performant and it get quite hot.
Parking on site but can be full easily, but near city streets offers more than enough space to."

The food is OK, but I expected it at a higher level."
Paris Grill,French,"2820 Boulevard Laurier Quebec City, QC G1V 0C1 Canada",QC,46.7676491,-71.2884749,5,"Some of our group members travelled here for our restaurant of the month club to try it out.  We arrived and found parking was in an underground parking lot. You can take the elevator right to the restaurant, so no need to go outside. Great for winter! Unfortunately our evening did not get off to a good start as we had to wait, despite having a reservation. The hostess was actively looking for a table to finish and as soon as someone left the staff rushed to prepare it for us. Both the hostess and the manager were apologetic and we ended up having a nice conversation with Nadia, the manager, while waiting. When we were finally seated, we were served by Demi who was friendly and engaging. The food was delicious, though some of my group members were disappointed that they had run out of their appetizer selection on the table d’hote. We enjoyed soup, calarmari and cheese fondue with blueberry compote as appetizers and filet mignon and duck as our main courses. Dessert was profiteroles, cheese cake, creme brulee. The food was delicious, cooked perfectly and well presented. We enjoyed some drinks including the spritz zeste, paris politan and lemonade with rose water with a shot of vodka and wine and sparkling wine, all of which were enjoyable. The sparkling wine was provided complimentarily to apologize for our wait and a free piece of chocolate mousse birthday cake was provided to one of us celebrating a birthday. The ambiance was nice, not too loud even though it was a large space, the service impeccable and Nadia and Demi and the hostess whose name I unfortunately do not recall went out of their way to ensure we had an enjoyable experience! I recommend that they set limits like many restaurants do, whereby people are given blocks of time for their reservations that they must respect and that after 15 minutes of lateness for a reservation that it is lost, this would prevent others with reservations from having to wait almost 45 minutes for a table."
Paris Grill,French,"2820 Boulevard Laurier Quebec City, QC G1V 0C1 Canada",QC,46.7676491,-71.2884749,4,"Very good restaurant, good food and services normally.

Be aware that they won’t do any breakfast pass 11h. Even at 11h05. Even if the waitress took a while to greet you. I always go there for breakfast but I was suprised that its kind of a hard rule. I do understand that they have the lunch to work on so most of the breakfast menu not available. But for 2 eggs and bacon and regular customer? Seen better personalized services for the price."

The Classique pizza was done perfectly, the cheese, oh the cheese was the highlight. Other items tried were the carbonara and creme brulee, both of which were excellent as well. Finish the evening off with a nice cup of house coffee and the entire experience was not only enjoyable but also very reasonably priced. Recommend that you make a reservation via Google, takes all of 30 seconds."

Chez Ashton,Burgers,"54 Côte du Palais Quebec City, QC G1R 4H8 Canada",QC,46.8143208,-71.2104411,5,"With a diner feeling to it, Chez Ashton does not disappoint with their Poutine. There are different size portions and the large one is either for someone who is really hungry or to share with someone else. The gravy tastes smooth and authentic and the cheese curds are squeaky and delicious. Don’t expect fine dining, but an authentic Quebec poutine experience."

It was soo good, at the first glance the fries looked over cooked and soggy but it was the opposite, the fries were crispy and the gravy not too salty and the cheese , the cheese was sqeeky and gooey at the same time and soo delicious!! Will definitely go back when in Quebec again!!"
Chez Ashton,Burgers,"54 Côte du Palais Quebec City, QC G1R 4H8 Canada",QC,46.8143208,-71.2104411,5,"It's a fast food joint, so not a place you go for atmosphere. Their Poutine is very good though, curds so fresh they speak just by looking at them. A good amount of them, too.

Glad I came here before ending my trip to Quebec."

Rascal,Barbeque,"5050 Boulevard Wilfrid-Hamel Quebec City, QC G2E 5X5 Canada",QC,46.8041288,-71.3305926,2,"Sadly we had a very bad experience on our first visit to the place. I felt like I was on a fast-food restaurant for the waitress was always in a hurry. She wrote my order wrong, never wanted to admit it, made me pay extra fees for what I didn't order and when I complained she did ZERO efforts to fix it. Instead, she offered me the additional side (the one I originally ordered) for an extra dollar. I thought it was a joke, but she was serious about it.

The tablecloth was dirt. It was not worth it mentioning because when I noticed we were already so disappointed by the service that we just rolled eyes.

I think the administration of the restaurant should consider hiring extra servers, for the lady who was serving us had at least 40 clients to take care of, when the recommended limit is 20. It just took her too long to come see us, to refill water, to just pay attention to our table.

Yes the food was great, but since my partner is a chef, we really don't feel like going out just to grab good food. We expect a good service and overall experience. So probably never going back to this place."
Rascal,Barbeque,"5050 Boulevard Wilfrid-Hamel Quebec City, QC G2E 5X5 Canada",QC,46.8041288,-71.3305926,3,"Service was ok and fast (please note restaurant wasn't full, busy days might be different). Menu was dirty and worn. Good food (we had the 9oz filet mignon). Price on the high side (or very high if options added), not sure you get what you pay for... There are many other options out there with a better price/food/presentation balance.  Restaurant atmosphere feels old, furniture looks used but othwerwise confortable."
Rascal,Barbeque,"5050 Boulevard Wilfrid-Hamel Quebec City, QC G2E 5X5 Canada",QC,46.8041288,-71.3305926,5,"Great experience! Service was good, the waitress was very nice and quick. Placed our order and bread was brought to the table right away. The food was very good! It was nicely accompanied by either potatoes or rice, or veggies or coleslaw. Portions were reasonable for the price and left feeling full and happy to return again if in the area!"

Went there for brunch on a Saturday morning. There were plenty of places to sit. The food was great and cheap (40ish for 3 plates (tapas sizes) and 2 awesome coffees). We took the avocado bene, the veggies (oh my lord trust me on this one juste take it) and the hummus toast #miammmm

Definitely would recommend."

There is a Vietnamese, Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Thailand's and so on.... But the menu only on French ! Too sad, you need to ask a staff about it.
In total..yes...try it.

P/s;
For travelers with kids, you can order a small white cooked rice or Vietnamese noodle soup."
Soupe et Cie,Soup,"522 3e Avenue Quebec City, QC G1L 2W3 Canada",QC,46.8235178,-71.2268764,5,"Delicious food, very filling Peruvian soup, good guacamole, good service, great staff, interesting decor and comfy benches/couches/pillows, cool Terasse with surprising roof.

I loved my experience there.

Cool facts:
Terrace with a roof made of bras.
Why are there bras hanging over my head? Last year, one of the employees raised money for breast cancer. They were selling bras and at some point, decided to create a roof with rows of bras. It creates a nice atmosphere and soft shadows.

One of the owner's brother is a woodworker and made a good bunch of decor and tables around.

This place has been serving delicious food for 10 years. Every dish brings you to a different country. Some soups are Asian inspired, others Peruvian, etc."

The food is pretty good too and they got a decent sized menu with lots of options. Definitely one of the best local cafes to come visit
Café Français,Bakeries,"1-425 Victoria Avenue E Regina, SK S4N 0N8 Canada",SK,50.4468662,-104.5781887,3,"We left feeling like they could not decide whether it was a boutique breakfast place or cafe as there were a mixture of both characteristics.  Good food, but overpriced.  We spent $40 to share a single breakfast (avocado/ eggs benedict on waffle) and two (non refillable) mugs of coffee.  The presentation was excellent, like a boutique style restaurant, service was more of a coffee shop feel.  The tables arent set, we had to collect utensils at the front counter (which is more of a coffee shop feel). We also had go to the counter to pay."

Cactus Club Cafe,Canadian (New),"140 Idylwild Drive S Saskatoon, SK S7L 0Y7 Canada",SK,52.1276685,-106.6698035,5,"I recently dined at the Cactus Club Cafe and it exceeded my expectations. The food, including the Grilled Dijon Salmon and Steak, was cooked to perfection. It's a popular place, so make sure to reserve in advance. The flavors in the salmon were amazing, with a tangy Dijon mustard complementing the moist and flaky fish. The steak was cooked just right, tender on the inside and perfectly seared on the outside. For dessert, the Cheesecake was heavenly, creamy and rich. The staff provided friendly and efficient service despite the busy atmosphere. Overall, The Cactus Club is a must-visit for delicious food and a great dining experience."

We shared the Cajun Chicken Sandwich with the kale salad as a side and the Butternut Squash Ravioli with Prawns since it was listed often in reviews. Both were good. I make a very tasty butternut squash ravioli dish at home so I’m biased and probably wouldn’t order that again but I look forward to returning and trying other dishes. Great atmosphere and good service. Everything was quick, too."
Cactus Club Cafe,Canadian (New),"140 Idylwild Drive S Saskatoon, SK S7L 0Y7 Canada",SK,52.1276685,-106.6698035,5,"the food here is phenomenal. we sat in the outside patio which is fully enclosed. i always recommend sitting out there cause it is so much more vibrant and lively than the dining room and lounge. every single time i come here (and that’s on a regular basis) i always get the blackened creole chicken. it is definitely spicy but it’s oh so good. i’ve been here over 5 times and never once had a bad experience with the food, staff, etc. i bring everyone here. i love this place, and i will recommend it to everyone and anyone i can. parking is always a hit or miss. either you get lucky with their free parking or you have to go find a spot at the ymca or midtown and pay per hour. definitely something that could be improved on. menu is also always offering new featured items which is good."

It was prawn ravioli trio, it was very delicious. My millionaire cut steak was average. The key lime pie was very good. The peanut butter crunch doesn't have the peanut butter taste that I was expecting slightly burnt taste to it . I gave 4 stars is becos' there is room for improvement. First is the service, knowing that we are sharing the appetizer , we were not given small plates for our convenience to share the dish. I had to catch the attention of a passing waiter to give us some utensils for our waitress is nowhere to be found. The rest already mention is the food itself. I  have tasted steak that melts into your mouth, it was soooooo good."

We are so thankful we did. Everything was amazing. From the food, to the service, to the atmosphere. I personally tried the brisket breakfast poutine( not sure of the correct name) it was great, perfectly cooked brisket with awesome flavour. Our server Katherine was such a lovely person. Her positive personality really helped set the tone for our brunch. She was extremely helpful and very bubbly, when we come back we hope we are lucky enough to get Katherine again.   All in all this restaurant is a must stop if you are in the area!"

The potatoes and proteins are tasteless apart from really salty. Coffee is as good as Timmy's or any instant coffee you can find in the supermarket. The two thin slices of smoked salmon on my Benny just look so sad.. The waiting staffs are not rude but also not warm nor welcoming.
There is nothing terribly wrong about this place but there is also no wow moment throughout the entire meal. Definitely the most overhyped restaurant in Saskatoon."

Little Grouse On The Prairie,Italian,"167 3rd Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7K Canada",SK,52.1273299,-106.6629136,4,"Overall great meal, It was $94 for these three dishes and I would say it’s pretty worth it. I had the tortellini and ravioli. The tortellini had a very strong wine flavour and the paste being very infused with all the flavours the sauce had. The ravioli was creamy with a hint of sweetness from the hazelnut.

The reason why I gave a 4 was that the bread from the meatballs tasted too much like burnt metal, It altered the taste too much and it wasn’t a super pleasant flavour.

Again, I recommend this place 100% great atmosphere and nice servers."

Thanks."
Scarlet,Canadian (New),"612 Spadina Crescent E Saskatoon, SK S7K 3H1 Canada",SK,52.1269789,-106.6592668,2,"We went to Scarlet last night for my birthday dinner.  We had the house salad, the roasted beet salad and the Caesar salad.  Most everything else on the menu had items my companions didn't care for in them so we thought we would go for the salad options.  The Caesar salad my daughter ordered was a little pile of lettuce and kale with a few croutons and parmesan flakes with pretty much no dressing.  I really wish we would of taken pictures but sadly we didn't.  I can say next time we would take photos but there won't be a next time.  $75 for 3 salads and all we drank was water.  We planned to order drinks later with the meal but when we saw the meals we decided not to.  The server was nice though.  That's the positive part of our experience."

Great food and great service. Yesterday, not so much.  Food orders came out wrong…twice.  Had to ask for our toast…..eggs were ice cold.  They charged us for food we didn’t get.  And, he brought us our bill while we were eating, which I thought was a bit weird….  Maybe I was just too annoyed at the time.  And to top it off, we addressed our poor experience to the waiter and supervisor and you could obviously tell they didn’t care. So, we won’t be going back."

Stopped in here for a late lunch as it is part of the Sheraton Cavalier hotel which is convenient if staying at the hotel.  Had the steak sandwich on sourdough bread with the signature salad; both dishes were tasty and filling."

The waitress was so friendly and nice. The environment was pretty pleasant.
Interestingly, when then realized that it’s his birthday, they offered him a free dessert with a candle on it. I appreciate their attitude.
They acted so warm in this cold winter.
The prices were normal and the quality of the food was great to us."

Rook & Raven delivered - many  options for a vegetarian. I got a soft pretzel, the Brussel sprouts and a massive salad. The salad in particular was amazing - many flavours and textures. Knocking off a star as they forgot to add the veggie burger as a protein to the salad, the dipping sauces for the Brussel sprouts and pretzels were the same sauce and quite bland, and because of the price - total for the meal was $60+, which is quite pricey, even adjusting for supply chain issues compared to similar restaurants. But the food was excellent and I would definitely go back!"

They have amazing selection of alcohol and limited but amazing food menu. We ordered so many things and they were all amazing. The service was really good and Victoria was really nice.

I had an amazing experience overall. Worth trying !!

One thing - Chicken wings could be better. They were too small in size could have better pieces of chicken in it.

Mushroom Bruschetta, Chicken Supreme, Fish & Chips and Smoked Wings is what we ordered with house lager .."

The staff were great, super friendly, efficient and the meals arrived promptly with a smile. The place was clean and well lit. Quiet when we arrived but slowly filled up with people dining and a few at the bar.
Highly recommend the cauliflower fritters.. they are good! There is a patio with tables outside for dining which seems popular but it is nice and cool inside so a better bet on a hot day like today. Music 🎵 is background levels and pleasant enough to talk but not interfere with the conversation. Ploughmans lunch is enough to share with three people... mmmhmmm"
Odd Couple,Asian Fusion,"228 20th Street W Saskatoon, SK S7M 0W9 Canada",SK,52.1262498,-106.6727761,5,"Wow! Saskatoon brings Asian fusion to life at Odd Couple. I had read reviews in a few top 100 lists in Canada and this humble restaurant did not disappoint. I don't often say this....but this may be the best Asian fusion restaurant I've ever been too including many of the top dining establishments in Vancouver.

The food is fresh and the flavors are genuinely Asian but subtle. The cooking allows the natural flavors of the actual food to come through. The variety of dishes was wonderful. And the presentation was beautifully clean.

The service was super friendly from all of the staff. They had time to converse and provide incredible recommendations.

The space has a super charged vibe. A tiny cozy space but they make good use of their area.

All around five stars. I was super impressed!

The food, including the Grilled Dijon Salmon and Steak, was cooked to perfection. It's a popular place, so make sure to reserve in advance. The flavors in the salmon were amazing, with a tangy Dijon mustard complementing the moist and flaky fish. The steak was cooked just right, tender on the inside and perfectly seared on the outside. For dessert, the Cheesecake was heavenly, creamy and rich. The staff provided friendly and efficient service despite the busy atmosphere. Overall, The Cactus Club is a must-visit for delicious food and a great dining experience."

We shared the Cajun Chicken Sandwich with the kale salad as a side and the Butternut Squash Ravioli with Prawns since it was listed often in reviews. Both were good. I make a very tasty butternut squash ravioli dish at home so I’m biased and probably wouldn’t order that again but I look forward to returning and trying other dishes.

It was prawn ravioli trio, it was very delicious. My millionaire cut steak was average. The key lime pie was very good. The peanut butter crunch doesn't have the peanut butter taste that I was expecting slightly burnt taste to it . I gave 4 stars is becos' there is room for improvement. First is the service, knowing that we are sharing the appetizer , we were not given small plates for our convenience to share the dish. I had to catch the attention of a passing waiter to give us some utensils for our waitress is nowhere to be found. The rest already mention is the food itself. I  have tasted steak that melts into your mouth, it was soooooo good."

The beef is one of the best dish I had here.The veggies are not recommended as I found some metal strings inside, probably from the cleaning supply, which is a bit disgusting.
I would say this restaurant is probably one of the best Chinese restaurants in Saskatoon. But the service and dishes are hit and miss."

Place: 4/5 unique place. It is generally clean, not sparkling clean, but clean. The decoration is very detailed, tries to look like a 60s diner.
Food: 4/5 We had a Pink Caddy Burger and a Caddy Burger, spinach soup, poutine and a strawberry malt. The burgers were ok, nothing out of this world. The poutine was ok too, the gravy was not hot enough, so it did not melt the cheese curds. The soup was again, just ok. I would give this place a 3/5 in food, however, THE MALT WAS DELICIOUS!"

Also our waiter was the perfect amount of attentiveness. Not constantly at your table, and still within eyesight if needed. He was also knowledgeable of the area and was pleasant to chat with. Kudos from the Winnipegers. Thanks for a great meal!"

This Cafe has a vibe like none other. From the moment we walked in (8:15pm) there is such a wow factor from the layout, the lighting, the VIBE. We got sat near the front door which most people would say no to buy we noticed that they had opening garage doors. We asked them to open it as it was a BEAUTIFUL evening and of course they jumped up and opened it for us. The fresh air, our waitress Shauna (coolest human alive), the random little convos with people walking by, THE FOOD...omg the food. Everything was so good. The drinks are made with love and every sip is an experience 😍
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

We had ordered the Peacemaker Po Boy and my goodness the gravy dip was so packed with flavour - despite the messy meeting I personally really enjoyed it with the Cajun fries! We also ordered the Blackened chicken, colonel bobs buttermilk chicken & the Fire Bird which were filled with raving reviews from my colleagues. Although For the drinks we had the chaser and the Espresso Martini and we felt it was a bit watered down that we couldn’t enjoy it. All in All we were much satisfied with the food and even the budget spent here."

We had the cup of gumbo, zombie fingers, shrimp brushetta, hush puppies with honey, pile o'bones, crab cakes, mussels and bang bang shrimp. Our favourites were the crab cakes and shrimp brushetta but everything was delicious. We finished off with the dessert special; peanut butter pie.

Free milk! (At least for us that can't handle the spicy power)
The fried chicken was Supa crispy wasn't quite to my liking but it did say it was crispy. The black berry's (garnish) for the blackberry lemonade was not good, drink itself amazing."

The atmosphere, food, drinks, and service were amazing. It is on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for.

We went as a large group, 14 of us, and ordered some bottles of wine for the table which came quickly and tasted great. Then, we ordered some appetizers: the bruschetta, calamari, and salumi. The bruschetta was phenomenal as the mozzarella was very fresh and soft, the calamari was decent, and the salumi was as expected for meats and cheeses.

For the main course, I ordered the bay scallops which came with the house pasta on the side and a caesar salad to start. The caesar salad was awesome as it was more of a vinaigrette than a heavy cream which I love. The scallops were slightly overcooked and covered in buttery breadcrumbs, but after pushing the breadcrumbs off the taste was great. The side pasta was simple, but tasty and had a little heat!

For dessert, we had the pannacotta and tiramisu. The pannacotta was all right, but the tiramisu was excellent!

We will definitely return!"

The pasta was on the thicker side, don’t get me wrong better that than mushy thin over cooked pasta but 1-2 more rolls would’ve been perfect. The margarita pizza was also tasty with fresh basil but it could’ve used more cooking in the middle. I was expecting at least half the slice to hold with wood fire pizzas like this but the slice barely held up on its own past the crust portion which made it more of a knife and fork eating situation."

It’s spacious and we had a nice booth. Our server was super friendly and conversational. I wish that I remembered her name. She’s a brunette in her 20s (who had recently travelled to Mexico and we talked about that) and made our experience even better. We ordered the Chipotle Calamari for a starter and it was tasty. A little too breaded for my taste but overall good. For my main, I ordered the Chicken, Brie & Fig Sandwich. The combo was sweet and savory. It reminded me of Turkey and Cranberry sandwiches. I had the yam fries as as a side. They were delicious. The chipotle aioli sauce that comes with the fries is amazing! It has the perfect amount of spice. My bf ordered the Cajun Chicken Sandwich. He said that he orders it often and it’s his favorite. And I asked about the staircase in the middle of the restaurant that leads upstairs. It’s a secret room that can be rented for $100 and sits up to six people. I definitely look forward to coming back and reserving it!"

I had two pieces of cajun blackened chicken, which were tender and covered in a thick layer of an incredible mix of spices. They rested on a bed of creamy coleslaw and warm potato salad.

I was recommended a beer from the Saskatoon Brewery from the server which paired perfectly and finished the night with a pretty good New York cheesecake.

Since that night, we searched for the recipe for the potato salad and found that Earls has a cookbook to make the meals at home!

All in all, it was a fantastic experience and I am excited to return as soon as I can!"

The food is great with very large servings and the service is friendly and quick. My daughter has celiacs and there is a good selection of gluten-free dishes which is a huge bonus! I highly recommend the spring rolls for an appetizer. The chicken and shrimp pad Thai is delicious as well as gluten-free free. Give this place a try...you won't be disappointed!

Challenges you may found is waiting to get into and car parking.

Highly recommend."

They serve mexican beer and cocktails. Their Margherita was The best in town. The location is also good. The only reason I deducted a star is because it's only open 6 days a week but for oy 4 hours- 4 to 8 pm. I get that it's a family business, but it's too short of time to stay open. Some people start dinner at 8! I wish they were open for longer"

Showed up without reservations and we were accommodated. Our waitress was the perfect mix of attentive and giving us space. The meal was a 10/10. We both had prime rib, medium rare and it was the best we’ve ever had. Absolutely delicious! We ordered with the asparagus/hollandaise/crab on top and highly recommended. The seasonal veggies were delicious and cooked to perfection. We had escargot stuffed mushrooms and they were a great start to the meal in addition to the yummy complimentary warm buns brought to us. We ate our meal in the lounge and the atmosphere was relaxing, our drinks were replenished and we had a wonderful evening. Can’t wait to go back next time we are in town."

Either our server had too many tables to serve, or was just not that efficient. We had to keep looking for them, plus had to ask for the standard bread that is served to every table before the meal. So,,, the bread,, not a fresh baked mini loaf anymore, it was chunks of thick , almost focaccia like bread, which was no where near as good as the mini loaves they used to serve. Our appetizers were very good. I had chicken, had trouble cutting though it, another person had a steak, was tough. Our server was very pleasant, just not around much.
Will probably not go back. When you spend over $200 for three meals, you don’t expect tough meat."

Also, the bathrooms are very clean! (Bathrooms are gender neutral, I don’t really care about that, but I guess it’s there for people who need it). It is strange that they do not have Men’s Bathroom. They do have the 2 ply toilet paper in the table and the flush is double mechanism. Excellent!👌👌 Unfortunately, there is no more Harry Potter audiobook playing.

We will be back here with more friends and families."
UNA Pizza + Wine,Pizza,"707 Broadway Avenue Saskatoon, SK S7N 1B3 Canada",SK,52.118571,-106.656222,3,I love Una pizza. It is always a treat to go to. Lots of memories and always great food. Supporting local is always a good feeling. Today I decided to order takeout as I was passing through Saskatoon. I ordered a Tiki and Sweet & Spicy arugula pizza. But it seems like we are missing a topping that is in the name of the pizza. Then to top it off the box is covered in honey. This is definitely not ideal to put into a car. Have to say I’m a little disappointed in the food as when you pay $26+ for a pizza. Not ideal to do take out.
UNA Pizza + Wine,Pizza,"707 Broadway Avenue Saskatoon, SK S7N 1B3 Canada",SK,52.118571,-106.656222,4,"I've been a regular customer of Una for some time now, and it's one of my favorite pizza places in town. The restaurant has always maintained a high level of quality, which is why I was excited to visit again last night. I got lucky and was able to get a seat quickly, and the service was as great as usual. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the quality of my pizzas. The toppings were sparse and did not cover most of the crust, which was a letdown for a $26 pizza. Overall, while I was satisfied with the service, the poor value for money of the pizza left me feeling disappointed. I hope that Una can improve the consistency of their pizzas in the future, as I love the restaurant and would hate to see its quality slip"
Congress Beer House,Gastropubs,"215 2 Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7K 1K8 Canada",SK,52.126944,-106.665556,1,"Service was too casual and seems like servers were more interested to keep their hair tidy than punching an order on time. Waited 30 min for a fish and fries. Food quality was bad, fries not properly salted and fish looked dark. At last I can only say they need professional staff on duty."

The person taking the order was friendly but other than that nothing was good about this place. The fish pakoras were not fresh at all! The vegetable pakoras tasted old and as if they were reheated from being in a warmer. The saffron rice was spoiled and looked like they just used food colouring in it. The lamb biryani was not biryani and tasted like an awful masala. The bhindi (okra) was way too oily, not tasty and had an awful after taste. We ended up throwing out lots of the food and guests were not impressed either. We definitely don’t recommend this place and found it was not worth the money we paid."
Spicy Bite,Indian,"113 3rd Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7K 1L6 Canada",SK,52.1279365,-106.6626829,2,"Foods are not tasty. The lamb biryani is below average, the chicken malai Kabab is salty and has the smell of raw spices, the butter nan is average which served after 10 minutes of the Kabab. I will not recommend others to go if you want to taste real Asian cuisine. In terms of price, the foods were not value for money"

I got the tandoori platter which was mediocre and the buttterchicken was one of the worst butterchickens I’ve had. Tasted so sweet and like ketchup. The naan seemed like it was pre-made from Walmart. And the lassi was not sweet at all. And when I requested to make it sweeter the waiter diluted it in water and handed it back. I paid 50 dollars for a meal that was worth maybe 5. DONT go to this restaurant"

The breakfast counter had a variety of options from strudels, cinnamon rolls to cereals and freshly cut fruits and parfaits. They also had fresh apple and orange juice along with a coffee station. Waffles were self serve with batter readily available. Eggs were at your service customisable to your liking. Sausage, bacon and hash browns were warmly served. Proof of vaccine before entry was required. The host/server/cook who was a superwoman was amazing. She was very welcoming and friendly. Fresh coffee with fresh cream for those morning coffee lovers.

You can sit at the bar and watch them being made. Flexible and accommodating on food preferences. We loved our evening here."
Picaro Cocktails & Tacos,Latin American,"101 20th Street W Saskatoon, SK S7M 0W7 Canada",SK,52.12582,-106.67062,3,"Did the Wednesday Date Night Dinner and our server was the sweetest!  She is very friendly, genuine and answered all of our questions.

All of our drinks were beautifully made and well balanced.

We were a party of four and did (1) Date Night Dinner which included: salsa trio and chips, green papaya salad, and we chose (2) orders of the Rogue tacos (chef rotating creation) and an order of churros.  We also ordered (2) orders of chicken skin chicarrones, (3) fish tacos, (3) pork tacos and (3) shrimp.

So the pico de gallo was delicious, but the other two salsas was not our favourite.  The Roasted Shishito salsa was really bitter.  And the Spicy Peanut one was a nice slow heat, but nothing memorable.  The chips were hit and miss with the salt level.  And the green papaya salad was…. bland.  Of course everyone has their own taste, but when I see a “green papaya salad” on the menu I think of the Thai style, full of chili, salt, sugar and funky fish sauce.

The star of the show and what I completely recommend is the chicken skin chicarrones.  It came with a honey and Aleppo dip ( I wish that was the dressing on the papaya salad) and were so crispy.  We ended up dipping those into the salsa trio too.

Churros were hot and fresh and one order comes with (4) churros.  The dulce de leche sauce was served warm.

I would go to Picaro for the great service, chicharrones and the drinks.  Don’t know if I would go back for the tacos or anything else…. Unless they revamp the menu."

Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the tacos. Make a reservation, as it's a small dining room.  Also the hot sauce for the tacos is wicked good and 🔥🔥. If they bottle that sh*t, I'm stocking up. I Highly recommend the creamsicle drink, but the hot batagna not so much. But definitely finish off with the churros because omg."

I opted for the chips & salsa trio to start and the chorizo and octopus as well as a couple of the cocktails like the Betty White and El Diablo and I must say it’s one of the good ones!

The service was standard, so no complaints there. In terms of food I got a spicy tuna bowl which was not bad but also nothing impressive. My partner's sirloin steak was delicious but she did get a rare steak when she asked medium rare, so make sure to take that into account. I think this place has a cool design and seems like the right place to go to enjoy a beer while watching some sports. Especially because they have happy hour every day after 9 pm"

They made sure we had everything we needed and didn't rush us out when we stopped in for food and drinks after an event. One of the best most friendly experiences yet. Food is amazing, I love doing dealers choice and the food and beverages served were top notch!"
State & Main Kitchen & Bar,Bars,"475 2nd Avenue S Suite 100 Saskatoon, SK S7K 1P4 Canada",SK,52.1236355,-106.6666821,2,"We used to visit this location quite often but haven't had a chance to stop by for quite some time.  Came in on a Wednesday evening for dinner and were seated right away.  I love the look of the bar as it is beautiful.  The restaurant had a faint sewage type of smell we noticed almost immediately.

Server was friendly and got our orders through.  Asked for a recommendation and the Royal Bangkok Bowl is what I settled with.  My wife had the Chicken Enchiladas.

We started with the lettuce wraps which were okay.  It only came with 3 pieces of lettuce so that was a bit of a disappointment as we had to ask for more.  As compared to other places like the Cactus Club, I would give them a 6/10.

My wife really enjoyed her Enchiladas.  I did get to try a bite and it was good!

However, I did not enjoy my Royal Bangkok Bowl.  I don't mind spicy but this dish was a bit too much for me.  It was a bit bland tasting.  After a few bites, I mentioned it to the server.  Her solution was to bring me more water but that doesn't resolve overly spicy food.  In all honesty, I would have preferred if they were willing to accept an alternative.  I am assuming most restaurants would be willing to send it back to the kitchen and provide a different meal.  I would have been more than happy to pay for it.

I don't usually like to complain but I did mention it to our server.  She didn't really think anything of it and kind of brushed it off.  I can appreciate that there isn't a whole lot they can do but I really felt that it wasn't a big deal to the staff.

I ALWAYS finish my meal or get it packed up.  I left more than half the meal untouched as I just couldn't eat it.  I tried but literally left the restaurant hungry.

Just a bit disappointed as I come from an industry that customer service is vital for our success, and I felt like I was being brushed off.  I could understand if the restaurant was extremely busy and they were just unable to accommodate for my situation.  However, the restaurant was a bit slower (Wednesday evening) which would have given them ample time to find a resolution.

My advice, listen to your customer and at least attempt to provide a viable solution.  I never would expect anything for free and would have been willing to pay for an alternative meal.

Thank you."

It’s more than just an Asian buffet, it’s more of a fusion buffet. I start my dining with the soups and salads and sushi. Then it’s on to a blend of foods ranging from pizza to perogies to pepper shrimp and orange chicken. An array of noodles and other Chinese dishes to finish off my main meal. For dessert I got jello, cheese cake, tiramisu and to top it all off, my final bite comes from the soft ice cream machine with toppings. The atmosphere is excellent, very clean, very attentive and very relaxed. Give this place a try, you won’t be disappointed. The price is right and the food is delicious."

They politely asked each guest to sanitize their hands each time they go up to the buffet which is great for keeping the communal utensils more sterile than other buffets I've experienced.

I've read other reviews on this restaurant having bland food although during our visit today that was not totally the case. There was an ok stocked buffet, but not as much to chose from as others I've been to. My partner in meal eating tried the spring rolls and she gave a 5/10, I thought the Greek ribs were tasty although maybe a bit more greek spice could be used 7/10. The rice, chicken chow mean were ok, but the items that really spiked our interest were the desserts, delicious! Some were sweeter than others which is why its great that they cut them into small portions. Overall the experience was nice, service was pleasant with many drink refills. Adult buffet is $22.95 each. Regular Iced tea $2.50 with unlimited refills."

Looks like angry attitude Even We just said thank you when she gave us a menu.
I have never been treated like this in this restaurant before."
Restaurant 224,Chinese,"224 3 Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7K 1L9 Canada",SK,52.1262547,-106.6628915,5,"coming from a foodie city like vancouver, this place is legit! very tasty pho, good soup and good quality beef as well. would definitely eat here again.  would've been better if the portions were slightly bigger and if they had basil for the pho."
Restaurant 224,Chinese,"224 3 Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7K 1L9 Canada",SK,52.1262547,-106.6628915,5,"Went in here for my first meal in Saskatoon. After a long day of flying and being awake for over 15 hours at that time, the restaurant was my first stop before exploring the city.
Thr atmosphere inside is quite nice, a lot more spacious than it appears form the outside looking in.
The gentleman who sat me down was very helpful and had great attitude, recommending dishes whilst chatting a bit too. He was very much on top of his duty and checked in with all the tables consistently to provide water and services.
The food was quite nice, nothing over the top but very delicious, and the selection combining Vietnamese with other East Asian dishes meant you have lots of options to select from.
I'd definetly recommend visiting this place as the service, speed of food, and taste all but makes for a nice experience.
Also, the prices are pretty cheap compared to Toronto, so even though there may be less Asian culture in Saskatoon, the food was also a lot cheaper than the hundreds if not thousands of restaurants in Toronto lol."
Restaurant 224,Chinese,"224 3 Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7K 1L9 Canada",SK,52.1262547,-106.6628915,5,Came into Saskatoon and ordered online from their website.  Ordering online you earn points.  Order was fast and fresh.  This is best place I've tried in Saskatoon so far.

Super Donair,Mediterranean,"110 33rd Street W Saskatoon, SK S7L 0T8 Canada",SK,52.1437032,-106.6715265,4,The donairs  are best I've had in the city. The taste and generous portions are worth the drive. I've been driving across the city for their yummy donairs  since 2017.  The owners offer friendly and attentive service.  The location is the reason for the low atmosphere rating. I normally plan to take my food out rather than dine-in. (Stay alert to your surroundings and visit during daylight.)
Super Donair,Mediterranean,"110 33rd Street W Saskatoon, SK S7L 0T8 Canada",SK,52.1437032,-106.6715265,5,We both got lamb donairs with slightly different toppings. They were both great tasting. The quantity of meat and toppings was good. Workers were very friendly. Other regular customers were also friendly. It was a great experience.

Cozy and welcoming vibes, wonderful friendly server, tasty food. Key lime pie is quite sweet- perfect for us sweet tooth’s! Only wish service could be faster as we had to wait a while for our bill- there’s only one server on a Friday evening. Still 5 star worthy and will def come back again!"

Konga Cafe,Caribbean,"204 Ave H N Saskatoon, SK S7L 2B7 Canada",SK,52.1311092,-106.680931,5,"This is some of the best food I have ever had. For dining in, the staff is quite friendly and helpful. It's a small, lively place that feels like a big family dinner. It's worth a trip across the city for a delicious meal."
Konga Cafe,Caribbean,"204 Ave H N Saskatoon, SK S7L 2B7 Canada",SK,52.1311092,-106.680931,4,"This place has friendly service and a chill, cozy vibe. The food can be hit and miss, but perhaps I just haven’t eaten there enough to find my go-to dishes yet. On our most recent visit I had the jerk mahi mahi, which was great. It had a really nice smoky flavour to it."
Calories Restaurant,French,"721 Broadway Avenue Saskatoon, SK S7N 1B3 Canada",SK,52.1183115,-106.6564411,4,"Very cute restaurant.  When we got there it wasn’t overly busy.  We were able to quickly order our drinks, but it took awhile to actually be able to order our food.  The server did apologize for the delay.

Oh my gosh.  The food though.  I wasn’t sure I was a fan of hollandaise sauce, but apparently I love it!  And their hot sauce was also very good 👀"
Calories Restaurant,French,"721 Broadway Avenue Saskatoon, SK S7N 1B3 Canada",SK,52.1183115,-106.6564411,4,"Dress nice and bring a date. Both of which I didn't do... Nonetheless, Calories is indiscriminate and all inclusive of all patrons despise state of dress or whatever accessories they bring. Good dinner, better lattes, best deserts. Come one, come all, and pack in the extra ""Calories"""
Calories Restaurant,French,"721 Broadway Avenue Saskatoon, SK S7N 1B3 Canada",SK,52.1183115,-106.6564411,5,"It was a slower part of the day, which may have helped. My server was a wonderful gentleman who was excited to show me what he reccomended on the menu. He even brought over extra napkins and a sharper knife without my asking as he knew it would be messy.

I felt checked in on the perfect amount. Just when I thought I may need something, someone was there to check on me.

Everything was prepared well and tasted amazing. My singular complaint is that the macaron fillings were either too sweet or too overpowering for the amount of work that went into the flavouring of the shell. It was a wonderful experience and I'd love to come visit again."
Calories Restaurant,French,"721 Broadway Avenue Saskatoon, SK S7N 1B3 Canada",SK,52.1183115,-106.6564411,4,It was very kind and the food was delicious. The portion seems small and the dessert cake was not as delicious as I thought. I guess I was looking forward to it too much.
Calories Restaurant,French,"721 Broadway Avenue Saskatoon, SK S7N 1B3 Canada",SK,52.1183115,-106.6564411,5,"Every plate was perfectly savoury. Especially, desserts were the best in the SK.
Every staff was gentle, nice and friendly."
Poached Breakfast Bistro,Breakfast & Brunch,"259 2 Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7K 1K8 Canada",SK,52.1262203,-106.6653183,3,"Overall good, but with some flaws. First, I ordered ""The Stacker"", and by its name and description, I expected something more substantial than what I received. The ""stack"" was more like a small mound, and there wasn't much food. It also came with 4 slices of bread which I felt was unnecessary, and simply a way to fill you up without giving you much substance. The food itself tasted pretty good, but nothing particularly interesting.

Secondly, we had a relatively large group which they were nice enough to accommodate. However, since many of us ordered the same thing, the waitress was very rude when I tried to verify with her if she was giving me my order (I asked for an extra runny yoke on my poached egg, but other people ordered theirs medium). She insisted the one she brought out was mine, but lo and behold, I cut into the poached egg and the yolk is cooked all the way through. I don't know why she was being so unnecessarily stubborn.

Credit where credit is due, the interior design is excellent."
Poached Breakfast Bistro,Breakfast & Brunch,"259 2 Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7K 1K8 Canada",SK,52.1262203,-106.6653183,5,"We dined here on a Saturday at 11a and were pleasantly surprised that there was availability. I had an oat milk latte and the garlic and sherry mushroom sauté with Brie omelette. My latte was creamy and without sweetness the way I like it and the omelette had more egg white and less strong Brie aroma which I prefer, too. The staff was friendly and the service was quick. I’ll definitely be back."
Poached Breakfast Bistro,Breakfast & Brunch,"259 2 Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7K 1K8 Canada",SK,52.1262203,-106.6653183,5,I haven’t been to Poached in too long. I returned to my old go-to: fresh-squeezed orange juice and the poached eggs over shrimp and crab cakes. So good! And the interior is so cool.
Poached Breakfast Bistro,Breakfast & Brunch,"259 2 Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7K 1K8 Canada",SK,52.1262203,-106.6653183,5,"My family and I had breakfast here last Sunday; the atmosphere and food made our day start off just perfect. The food was made perfectly and was the right amount to leave satisfied. The meal was fresh, healthy and well plated. My son loved the croquettes 🥰."
Poached Breakfast Bistro,Breakfast & Brunch,"259 2 Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7K 1K8 Canada",SK,52.1262203,-106.6653183,5,We enjoyed Poached so much that we had breakfast there twice during our 5 day visit to Saskatoon. It's a quaint little bistro with delicious food and terrific staff. We were amazed how friendly and efficient all the staff were even though it seems they never stop running.
Thien Vietnam,Vietnamese,"123 3rd Avenue N Saskatoon, SK S7K 2H4 Canada",SK,52.1291584,-106.6623598,1,"If I could give no stars, I would.

My partner and I ordered from here today for lunch. Unfortunately, it was not as good as I remember Thiens being about 2-3 years ago. Their business was booming during that time.

When our food arrived, it smelled weird. We both ordered noodle bowls, I had a BBQ chicken, and my partner had the pork.

First few bites were alright until we dug deeper in our bowls and saw that the greens were completely old and wilted. This is disgusting. I'm not sure how this happens, or how they could allow such poor quality food to leave the kitchen. You can clearly see that the greens are old through the transparent container. This is crazy to me.

I will no longer be ordering from Thiens, what a waste of money."
Thien Vietnam,Vietnamese,"123 3rd Avenue N Saskatoon, SK S7K 2H4 Canada",SK,52.1291584,-106.6623598,1,"I ordered a 91 chicken, this time they served with less race as always, looks like is half of it"
Thien Vietnam,Vietnamese,"123 3rd Avenue N Saskatoon, SK S7K 2H4 Canada",SK,52.1291584,-106.6623598,5,food is always good and its a good amount for cheap
Thien Vietnam,Vietnamese,"123 3rd Avenue N Saskatoon, SK S7K 2H4 Canada",SK,52.1291584,-106.6623598,3,I was there to meet a friend. There were not much people but still we were waiting for a long time to be seated! Order number 69 and the food was fine but again had to wait for a long time! The price was reasonable but waiting time was too much! I had to renew my parking twice!!
Thien Vietnam,Vietnamese,"123 3rd Avenue N Saskatoon, SK S7K 2H4 Canada",SK,52.1291584,-106.6623598,5,This place is so good not a complaint yet. I love the wonton soup special deluxe. And the noodle bowls r amazing as well. Staff is pretty. Good as well. go back for sure
Delight+ Chinese,Chinese,"3126 Clarence Avenue Suite 122 Saskatoon, SK S7T 0C9 Canada",SK,52.0847958,-106.6480527,5,The other half and I wanted to try this restaurant cause we have never been here. The other half ordered lemon chicken and rice. I ordered the 8 king special wonton. I was tempted to try their hot soups. Not today I told myself. Our server was friendly and hospitable. People started to fill up the tables so it shows the food was Delicious...
Delight+ Chinese,Chinese,"3126 Clarence Avenue Suite 122 Saskatoon, SK S7T 0C9 Canada",SK,52.0847958,-106.6480527,5,"Best Chinese food I've had in Saskatoon. Ordered on skip for mothers day. Every dish we ordered was delicious. So hard to pick a favorite but the fried noodles, fried rice and ginger beef are up there. Can't wait to order again and try a few new dishes. This is by far my new go to takeout spot!"

No doubt the best Chinese cuisine in Saskatoon. Highest quality of food and customer service. Have varieties of food in menu and buffet. Quantity is a lot. Price is reasonable for the quantity and quality. All the staff members are very friendly and nice.

The Chopped Leaf,Salad,"1844 McOrmond Dr Saskatoon, SK S7S 0A5 Canada",SK,52.1489605,-106.5691447,4,Was a nice option for lunch. I would also feel very comfortable recommending this place to my vegan friends. Decent prices.

I’m from Toronto, and was so excited to try this after getting amazing feedbacks. I loved it’s food, and ambience. Host Ginni Malik herself took care of me. I was so impressed, despite it was such busy time. Quesadilla  was so yummmm. You should guys open one in Toronto. I will miss this food there."
The Chopped Leaf,Salad,"1844 McOrmond Dr Saskatoon, SK S7S 0A5 Canada",SK,52.1489605,-106.5691447,4,"Nice clean place. Great location. The Sikh guy working here was great, and knew his job.
There's was this girl, forgot to provide bag to carry my orders out, didn't provide any napkins inside!
Food is good, seems healthy too! I enjoyed it personally"
The Chopped Leaf,Salad,"1844 McOrmond Dr Saskatoon, SK S7S 0A5 Canada",SK,52.1489605,-106.5691447,3,Just went in there and clearly ordered and paid for bowls and got home to discover they gave us salads as there was no rice to be seen in either container. we were looking forward to the rice as it’s the most filling part of the bowl. Very disappointed.
The Chopped Leaf,Salad,"1844 McOrmond Dr Saskatoon, SK S7S 0A5 Canada",SK,52.1489605,-106.5691447,1,This used to be my go to location but after my last two experiences I won’t be ordering again. I reached out to Skip regarding this issue and they refunded me $10 out of the $30 that I paid for my bowl I couldn’t even eat. Literally almost threw up when I had opened it up. Not sure how they can even package food that is of this quality. Awful. 🤢
Mi Hong,Vietnamese,"811 51st St E Ste 5 Saskatoon, SK S7K 0X7 Canada",SK,52.172606,-106.652663,5,"The biggest kept secret in the city. My GF introduced them to me when we started dating, and I have been hooked ever since. The consistency in not only the food but also the service is top notch. I have yet to come across a crispy roll in this city that can compare to theirs. If you haven't tried them yet, I highly highly  recommend that you do, I promise that your meal will be incredible and the service will have this place become a regular for when you need to eat out. Finally, the price for the food keeps you within your budget and lord knows we need that now then ever. Thank you Mi Hongs for providing incredible food and service at a great price!"
Mi Hong,Vietnamese,"811 51st St E Ste 5 Saskatoon, SK S7K 0X7 Canada",SK,52.172606,-106.652663,3,"Great noodle bowl and spring rolls. The Pho has barely any broth to even consider it soup. When I mentioned this to the server, they advised that they can give me more broth for 3 more dollars."
Mi Hong,Vietnamese,"811 51st St E Ste 5 Saskatoon, SK S7K 0X7 Canada",SK,52.172606,-106.652663,5,"One of my Saskatoon go-to Vietnamese restaurants! Food flavour and quantity are great, the staff is friendly and efficient, and the price is very reasonable. The interior is exactly what you should expect from an Asian comfort food Restaurant. For reference, I have eaten in many Vietnamese restaurants in many countries, including Vietnam 😊😊"
Mi Hong,Vietnamese,"811 51st St E Ste 5 Saskatoon, SK S7K 0X7 Canada",SK,52.172606,-106.652663,5,Their special noodle bowl is amazing. All the meat is good and perfectly seasoned. The chicken in their noodle bowl is breast meat. Their spring rolls are amazing! Need to try more off the menu but this noodle bowl is too good.
Mi Hong,Vietnamese,"811 51st St E Ste 5 Saskatoon, SK S7K 0X7 Canada",SK,52.172606,-106.652663,4,"This is second time ordered food from here and they forgot to include one noodle bowl. One time I can understand but twice in a row and I was picking up said 20 minutes for pickup was here 20 minutes till had to wait another 20 minutes for food and it wasn’t even busy in the restaurant.
She did charge for 1 noodle bowl but very poor services and very disappointed cause we liked their food not again anytime soon

Well we decided to try here again and the service and food was really great and hot.  The only issue we had was the salad rolls seemed to be done differently but still good
And they got our order correct so that was a bonus so glad cause we will be going back again now"
White Lotus,Vietnamese,"4-15 Worobetz Place Saskatoon, SK S7L 6R4 Canada",SK,52.1306064,-106.7259446,5,"Tasty & lots of food. Had th #45 noodle bowl. Spring rolls were slightly overdone, however, still 5 stars. Definitely will be back. The ice coffee was delicious."

I quickly pick the right choice, and they served me quick and polite.
I have got the Deluxe Pho which includes raw beef, beef tripes, beef balls and beef tenders. This is the XL size as the photo shown, which is the one you should try in a Pho restaurant.
Sprouts and lime serve on side for the Pho (rice noodle soup), very Vietnam style.
The soup tastes good, onions bring out sweetness, and sprouts improve texture. No much MSG to dry your mouth up.
I put here into my top visit list."
White Lotus,Vietnamese,"4-15 Worobetz Place Saskatoon, SK S7L 6R4 Canada",SK,52.1306064,-106.7259446,5,"White Lotus is hands down, one of my personal favorite restaurants in Saskatoon.

We both ordered medium for steak. One came out under cook, more liked rare. The other one was over cooked, hard, burned on the surface. Honestly I was disappointed since I went there for a special day. It was my first time going there. I gave three stars because the staff was so nice and friendly and the bacon wrapped jalapeno was so good!"

It’s spacious, they had a prize giveaway during the game and special on beer, alcohol and food. We ordered the nachos and Wagyu Beef Gyoza. The gyoza were super tasty and the sauce was so delicious.

The Canadian Brewhouse,Canadian (New),"3150 Preston Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7T 0V1 Canada",SK,52.0858852,-106.6258687,3,"Service was pretty good overall and definitely the best part of the experience.

Food was pretty bland. The oddly shaped and small bowls were really awkward to eat out of. Would've preferred just normal cutlery too. A little steeply priced for what food I got as well.

We ate on the patio and things looked fine, but the music is too loud making it hard to have a conversation, and in my opinion was not cohesive with the rest of the setting."
The Canadian Brewhouse,Canadian (New),"3150 Preston Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7T 0V1 Canada",SK,52.0858852,-106.6258687,4,I'm not normally a fan of the Canadian Brewhouse but this location was pretty good. It had a prime rib special which was decently priced and tasted pretty good. The service was good except for my prime rib came 10 minutes after another at our table. Would go back to this location.
The Canadian Brewhouse,Canadian (New),"3150 Preston Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7T 0V1 Canada",SK,52.0858852,-106.6258687,4,"Going to the brewhouse is always a mixed bag. The food is good, the beer cold, but service iffy.
We went on a Tuesday for tacos, which were excellent. But had definitely been sitting waiting for a while. Initial service was also slow - waited about 5min to get sat (by a server). Waited about 10min total to be asked for a drink, and then to get a drink. We were almost totally done our tankards (which we were overcharged for) before they even took our food order. And then cold (see previous comment).
I estimated about 60 patrons for 3 servers. Which would probably be fine, but they were also doing host duties and  making their own drinks. Though there was a bartender."
The Canadian Brewhouse,Canadian (New),"3150 Preston Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7T 0V1 Canada",SK,52.0858852,-106.6258687,1,"This used to be a really great restaurant to go and eat at at any time of day but unfortunately their standards seem to have plummeted. First the was no host to seat us so we had to wait for a few minutes to get a table even though they we not busy, bit whatever if that was the only problem we had id be fine but there is more. Then it took almost 10 min for the waitress to even introduce herself and take our drinks, came back with them quick enough bit didn't ask if we were ready to order or nothing and did not come back. After 20 mins we got up and left. Absolutely unacceptable."
The Canadian Brewhouse,Canadian (New),"3150 Preston Avenue S Saskatoon, SK S7T 0V1 Canada",SK,52.0858852,-106.6258687,5,This place is amazing.  I had previously ordered here through skip and got my food  cold.  I wrote a review from a previous account and the manager invited me back.  I went with my bridesmaid day before my wedding before I went to look for a dress because the designer ruined mine and sent it late.   Manager made my day by fixing my skip order.  Despite my bad day of knowing I would have no dress the atmosphere and service of management and staff was amazing.  I will definitely be back.

Met family here for an evening meal on the patio- it's pet friendly, so everybody could join. We were the only ones out there amazingly enough, and it was airy, bright, and lots of greenery.
Our waitress was wonderful- she knew her menu inside out, provided amazing service, super friendly, and brought treats out for the pups.
We all enjoyed our food, better than run of the mill pub grub, booze wasn't anything to write home about, but wasn't expecting it to. Overall definately recommend,  and will definitely return"

Absolutely amazing...think flavor of ""Old school KFC"" on Lemon pepper ribs!! Honey Garlic, is crisp on the outside with a bold Honey garlic juicy flavor. Creamy Greek is basically Greek ribs.

Our  server was friendly and recommended the lunch special for the day, a Caesar burger.  It was so delicious!  Tasted like the salad but in burger form.  Love that everything is homemade including dips, burger patties and even the spice mixture for their Caesar drink!  Highly recommend this cozy little pub!"

They've completely renovated the place and done a fantastic job. The menu has a wide selection of dishes. I went for the burger and it was done perfectly with really tasty fries.

The patio is a nice addition to the place and I love the decor. I would definitely recommend visiting."

The food arrived promptly and was prepared exactly as requested—medium spicy. The flavors were excellent, and the overall quality was impressive. It's great to find a place that can deliver such delicious food. Highly recommended for a satisfying dining experience."

They served starters (Salad, Chana chat, Samosa) and mains (butter chicken, chicken karahi, beef karahi, Aalo Ghobi, Choly, shahi dal) and dessert (Kheer). Most othe items tasted good and staff was friendly too."

I always get the personalized touch from their service at their homely environment. They always maintain food taste, and i could never say NO to any one of their food items of the buffet, which I found freshly made always. The range of food selections for the buffet menu is simply great. I can ask them if I have any concern any time without hesitation and they are always accomodative. I admire their staff who are always serving us with a big smile despite any weather conditions of Saskatoon!!! Anyone must try out their PAYESH/KHEER... ❤️"

The flavors were incredible and the spices were perfectly balanced. The menu had a great variety of options and everything we tried was exceptional.

We had a Modelo and Margareta.   Ordered some chips and Picante Salsa as well as Coconut Shrimp.  Both were up quick and tasted excellent.   For our meal, we took advantage of the Taco Tuesday special and each tried the Pork and Chicken tacos.  Also serve fast and full of flavor.    Honestly, I felt our bill was very modest and for what we had.  I recommend trying this place if you haven't, you'll probably be back again."

It had been a while since my last visit when I took a friend there for lunch this week. Our meals were amazing. As usual! I had the chicken enchiladas with an added side of sweet potato fries.

But I was so sad to see the pozole removed from the menu. Here’s hoping to see it back sometime in the near future!"

I got a chicken and corn burrito, It was good, good size. Friend got the Wednesday special Taco platter, he got 2 fried chicken and 2 fish tacos- chicken ones reminded him of 711 chicken just more spicy but the fish tacos were delicious, I got to try some too and I loved it as well definitely something I recommend! I wouldn’t say it was worth the money honestly but it was ok all came together 115$ got a michelada and peach snap? (Can’t remember) and they were good I couldn’t finish the michelada but I think others might enjoy it"

I spilled my drink and they were nice enough to clean it and not charge extra, I appreciate that. 5 Star Service from the guy with long hair and beard. He was cool! Reminded me of Vikings!

The lamb burger was great!

Will be back."
Yard & Flagon,Pubs,"718 Broadway Avenue Saskatoon, SK S7N 1B4 Canada",SK,52.1182193,-106.6572412,3,"Nice rooftop area for dining on Broadway, so a cool location. Split a fish and chips and chicken wrap with spouse. I don't recommend the fish and chips, the fish was mediocre at best and on the smaller side for a two piece.  Fries were awesome though, tartar sauce just ok. Chicken wrap was decent, comparable to a chicken wrap you'd get anywhere in the city though. Pricing I find a bit on the high side for the food quality, taste and portion sizes. Got a pint of blue moon for $8.95, beer was good. Service and food was a bit on the slow side, waited over 35 minutes for our food and the waitress forgot the gravy we ordered, when the gravy did come I didn't find it to be overly flavorful. Not sure I'll be in a rush to come back with so many good pub options in the city with arguably better food for the same if not cheaper prices."
Yard & Flagon,Pubs,"718 Broadway Avenue Saskatoon, SK S7N 1B4 Canada",SK,52.1182193,-106.6572412,4,"Giving it 4 starts, as the service and the food were  superbe!

Drinks are very overpriced . 14$ for a small margarita is way too much. The drink menu was literally printed on a piece of paper and had no prices displayed."

Aroma,Pizza,"405 20th Street E Saskatoon, SK S7K 6X6 Canada",SK,52.1243944,-106.6615276,3,"Waited a while to be seater either the server or hostess kept looking at us and then going back to what they were doing. Then someone came over seated us. Took our drink order, coffee, water. Then someone else came over to take our food order. She was trying her best, she confirmed our order and then said, ""Oh, I can't read my own writing. Thanfully, she confirmed our order. Then another person came over and asked if we needed anything, and we asked for more water. Our meal came, (still no waters) we finished and then the water came. It seemed very disoriented with who ur server was, and there were two of them at one point. Also, I watched one of the serves take a glass of water to two different tables and then ended up putting it on an empty table. The server who took our order asked about how the bill would be split. We indicated it would be separate. Then, the other server came and gave us the bill all together. Again the staff stepping on each other toes. So we get the bills and then no one around to pay. I had to ask the manager after about 15 mins. How to pay the bill as no one was around. Overall, I wouldn't say it was good. And the service needs to be improved upon."
Aroma,Pizza,"405 20th Street E Saskatoon, SK S7K 6X6 Canada",SK,52.1243944,-106.6615276,3,"First off, if you're looking for a qood quality meal with great selection of different dishes, this is a great place to eat. My wife and I ordered a steak and fried and I ordered the Montreal smoked meat sandwich with fries. Both dishes cooked well but the steak was on the overcooked side. Good helping of food to leave you feeling satisfied.

Now the reason for 3 stars. The waitress attending our table was extremely slow. We were there for a mother's day celebration with 8 people on the Saturday but there was nearly NO ONE in the restaurant. Maybe 2 other tables aside from ours. There was 4 drinks that were ordered and it took 45 mins for the drink to finally come out. By this time, she hasn't even taken our order. We tried to stay as patient as possible but once we notice an hour has gone by without any food coming out, we notice another table that came after us already ordered and had there food before us. They were another table of 5 and came approx 15-20 mins AFTER we arrived.

Once the food finally came out, our mothers order was still wrong and we politely  requested to unfortunately send it back and have the correct dish made. The waitress then made a comment saying ""I'm pretty sure you said *this dish*, but I'll get it changed anyways..."" in a bit of a irritable kind of way.

We are open to coming back and trying other dishes but hopefully we can get a different server for are pleasant experience. Will update if we head back to Aroma again."
Aroma,Pizza,"405 20th Street E Saskatoon, SK S7K 6X6 Canada",SK,52.1243944,-106.6615276,4,"Food needed just a little more salt...a bit spices and flavor complexity wouldn't hurt either. What can you expect from Saskatoon I suppose.

Would recommend the mushroom and tofu risotto and apple galette!"

First , I went there to grab 2pizza and their steak with fries for pick up, was really disappointed that the chef stuffed the steak, mashed potatoes and vegetables in the same box.... so I decided to call back and the lady at the bar did something veryyyyyy out of ordinary. She said on phone ""I'm so sorry for everything and after my shift ,I will personally come drop you off your full plate in different boxes at your house"" . I was kind of hoping it wasn't just talking.  Around 10:30pm she actually came to my door with everything way more organized than I ever wanted. She is the best 👌 👍 overall,  I think food is 80% of satisfaction but 20% the service and she did gived me more than her 100%. I really appreciate that also pizza was to die for 😍

I don't know sushi very well so it was difficult to pick but the flavors were very good. There is noodle, rice and protein dishes as well as all the sushi. It would have been nice to have better images on the menu for some of the items but because you pick the items it's great for sampling different things."

It's totally worth the money. Creamy cheese on the top makes it even more delicious. Would love to try dine-in the next time to enjoy the hot pizza freshly made.

I asked for no bacon on my Cesar salad which came out with loads of bacon. I ordered a chicken Greek pita. Chicken was stone cold so I asked about it and server said that’s how it is. So I tried it and it was so atrocious the sauce was super garlicky. Server asked if I wanted anything else which I kindly declined and she asked if I wanted it taken off the bill since I didn’t eat it. She brings the bill with my pita still on there. Why ask if I wanted it off? Then gentleman at front asked how everything was when we paid the bill. I say “not good” he says “ah.” “Bundle up out there it’s cold!.”       If I could give it a 0 star I would but the server was very nice."

Granada House Family Restaurant,Pizza,"904 22nd Street W Saskatoon, SK S7M 0S1 Canada",SK,52.1295074,-106.683552,2,"We just had a meal at Granada House. The meat was piping hot and the veggies and rice (both on the side) were cold. Appears the cook plated half the food when the order went in, then the other half when the meat was ready. We shared the concern with our waitress, who noted she picked up the food quickly.  Pointed out that it was not her issue - rather the cook not plating correctly.  She did not offer to take the cold food away.  When we paid, same thing. We told the gentleman who asked about our meal that half of it was icy cold. He asked if we told the waitress. Yes, yes we did. Again, nothing was done. If you only pay lip service to your customers, why bother at all?  We would rate half the meal as 4 star, the other half as a 1. Average for the meal?2.5"

Charging 25 for a plate is outrageous to start with but the waste fee is unacceptable to charge I will not be returning. I have included a picture of the note on every table in this establishment. They should fix this because not right to charge for waste. FIX IT

They are rude, it was dirty and unorganized. The washroom barely works. Water is not served at tables nor napkins or anything. The prices are also over priced with small portions of food. We ordered inside to dine in. We were waiting , we thought they were making our food already but then they told us to pay first..
They’re not gonna cook it without paying it first.. People here are racist. We were so offended!"

Best Taste Chinese Restaurant,Chinese,"102-216 33rd Street W Saskatoon, SK S7L 0V1 Canada",SK,52.1440669,-106.6728413,1,Last night we ordered 40$ worth of food. We called in the order at 415 pm and asked to have it by 530 the said sure. We ordered 2 noodle bowls and spring rolls. We have ordered from here aprox 30 times in a few years and this is the 3 time having a major issue. This time they showed up 20 minutes late the food was completely cold and they forgot the debit machine and wanted me to etransfer the money to them. They told me someone would show back up with a debit machine. When I called the store to tell them the food was cold and I would like the delivery fee refunded they man yelled at me that they were on their way back to take back my food. I told him we were already heating it up. He hung the phone up on me. After 5 times of calling back to ask when they would be coming back for payment he told me when they had time. I told him I wouldn’t be ordering again as last time they took 50 minutes to find my house and also delivered me cold food. Then I asked for an owner I was told they live in another state. The manager didn’t want to talk to me so they basically just said stop calling and keep the food. Be aware when you order. Also just to note we were very surprised when all the times we have ordered spring rolls and they were deep fried so when we ordered that same thing and they came as baked spring rolls it’s a little sad. Thanks for treating me so rudely I felt others should be aware.

They have a good variety of menu from rice meals, soups, chicken and beef dishes. The staff was very pleasant and attended to us well so I commend them for that. A bit more attention towards the bathroom cleanliness, otherwise it’s fine. The pricing were definitely affordable with almost, if not, everything being under $15 and they’re also open late too!"

It’s spacious and we had a nice booth. Our server was super friendly and conversational. I wish that I remembered her name. She’s a brunette in her 20s (who had recently travelled to Mexico and we talked about that) and made our experience even better. We ordered the Chipotle Calamari for a starter and it was tasty. A little too breaded for my taste but overall good. For my main, I ordered the Chicken, Brie & Fig Sandwich. The combo was sweet and savory. It reminded me of Turkey and Cranberry sandwiches. I had the yam fries as as a side. They were delicious. The chipotle aioli sauce that comes with the fries is amazing! It has the perfect amount of spice. My bf ordered the Cajun Chicken Sandwich. He said that he orders it often and it’s his favorite. And I asked about the staircase in the middle of the restaurant that leads upstairs. It’s a secret room that can be rented for $100 and sits up to six people. I definitely look forward to coming back and reserving it!"

I had two pieces of cajun blackened chicken, which were tender and covered in a thick layer of an incredible mix of spices. They rested on a bed of creamy coleslaw and warm potato salad.

I was recommended a beer from the Saskatoon Brewery from the server which paired perfectly and finished the night with a pretty good New York cheesecake.

Since that night, we searched for the recipe for the potato salad and found that Earls has a cookbook to make the meals at home!

All in all, it was a fantastic experience and I am excited to return as soon as I can!"
The Island Stone Pub,American (Traditional),"62 Broadway Street N Kensington, PE C0B 1M0 Canada",PEI,46.437822,-63.63891,5,"Good food, great beer. Food and drinks were affordable especially for the quality. I had a blue cheese burger that was delicious. Wonderful beer selection on tap which included both house beer and PEI favorites. Some people in my group were vegetarian and others had allergies to soy and gluten, and didn't have a problem with finding something on the menu for them which they enjoyed. Staff were all extremely friendly and accommodating. I highly reccomend this restaurant."

The Island Stone Pub,American (Traditional),"62 Broadway Street N Kensington, PE C0B 1M0 Canada",PEI,46.437822,-63.63891,3,"We LOVED this place so much our first visit we were really excited to return. Unfortunately we were quite disappointed. Atmosphere- fantastic, service pretty great but food was a bummer. My hubby didn’t enjoy his beer but his food was good, our appetizer was awesome but my steak was overcooked and had way too much sauce it took away from what an amazing steak should taste like and when I spend 30$ on my meal I expect excellent cooking."
The Island Stone Pub,American (Traditional),"62 Broadway Street N Kensington, PE C0B 1M0 Canada",PEI,46.437822,-63.63891,5,"We had an amazing Meal here today reserved as table of 4 but added 2 more.  They were very accomodating.  If I could add more stars I would for this review.  Our waitress was hands down the best, I have reviewed many many restaurants since moving here,she was above expectations.  You made our Mother's Day lunch Amazing.  My brother was a suprise from Ontario.
The food today was incredible, most of us started with a bowl of the red pepper soup, Wow,it was amazing, my bro had 2 bowls lol.  Fish Taco, fish, fish and chips and the lobster crab sandwich were above par.  We will definately be back.  This is my New favorite in PEI. If you have not tried this amazing restaurant, please do.  8 star by far.  Besides the food being the best, so are the staff.  Looking forward to our next date.
Mothers Day again.  Food was incredible. Fish and chips and Lobster crab roll, Wow5 🌟"
The Island Stone Pub,American (Traditional),"62 Broadway Street N Kensington, PE C0B 1M0 Canada",PEI,46.437822,-63.63891,5,"I cant stop thinking about the burger or the crab/shrimp chips and dip. First of all the history of this resto was awesome. The old Kensington Train Station, super cool. The decor is awesome. The food was amazing and the service was exceptional. Highly recommend the single burger however i wish i did the double it was so good. I cant wait to go back.

Updating review now that I've visited a second time. The burger was still the best burger I've had. Definitely worth the money! Must stop here! If you're extra hungry then you need the jalapeño popper dip!!!!"
JMK Fish Mart,Seafood,"110 Queens Wharf Summerside, PE C1N 0A6 Canada",PEI,46.3907168,-63.7929755,4,Great outdoor patio with umbrella and nice view of the marina entrance. We had a couple vegetarians who enjoyed the submarines. The fish and chips were good according to the family. I loved the breaded clam and chowder. The chowder is 199% seafood. The only complaint was that the macaroni and potato salad were under cooked but there was a lot of food anyhow.
JMK Fish Mart,Seafood,"110 Queens Wharf Summerside, PE C1N 0A6 Canada",PEI,46.3907168,-63.7929755,5,"Friendly service and delish seafood in a casual atmosphere with 5 or 6 small tables inside.  We wished we had time to come more then once because Jolly Rogers has the best lobster roll on the island (and we went to a lot of places and tried:) It was raining on our last night in PEI so we were in the mood for chowder.  Jolly Rogers seafood fully loaded chowder was the best chowder we had with the right balance of creamy, some potato but lots of big chucks of fish and assorted seafood.  The chicken burger was a hit too as well as the PEI fries.  Thank you for friendly service too that made us feel like regulars.  We highly recommend if you are in Summerside and if not, make a point on going."
JMK Fish Mart,Seafood,"110 Queens Wharf Summerside, PE C1N 0A6 Canada",PEI,46.3907168,-63.7929755,5,"Delicious food, I had the fish sandwich and seafood chowder, my husband had the fish and chips. Tasty, not too greasy, good flavour and big pieces in the chowder. Friendly service and we enjoyed eating out on the deck. Watched an osprey catch his dinner as we ate ours. Planning on bringing my daughter soon as now she wants to try it."
JMK Fish Mart,Seafood,"110 Queens Wharf Summerside, PE C1N 0A6 Canada",PEI,46.3907168,-63.7929755,5,"Wow! Was deciding on a place to eat dinner with my family after a long day of travelling. Picked this place based solely on the reviews… boy were they right. Everything we had was delicious. I got 2 fish tacos with a side of potato salad. It was so big and filling that I could only eat 1 taco! Fish was amazing and so well cooked. My husband had his first ever lobster roll and he said it was Fantastic! He said the fries were homemade and delicious. My son had the 2 piece fish and chips… it was soooooo good. Pieces of fish were so big, and I thought no way he was going to eat it all… but he did.. he said they were too good not to eat! Lol
The staff was so nice, helpful and very welcoming. Came to our table twice to see how we were doing with our food. Please go here, and you will not be disappointed. Promise1
Also sat on the patio at the back. Lovely views too!"
JMK Fish Mart,Seafood,"110 Queens Wharf Summerside, PE C1N 0A6 Canada",PEI,46.3907168,-63.7929755,5,"Every island has a hidden treasure; this is one of those.  This cute little seafood gem is nestled on a small boardwalk in the Summerside Harbour. Jolly hits it right with quality of food, taste, portion and price.  My friend had the fish n chips and I devoured a stuffed lobster roll.  Because our meals were so good, we topped it off with seafood chowder instead of going for dessert. Sorry no food photo. I was busy eating 👅.

And for anyone visiting from New England, there is a little ‘home’ in this fish shack.  Stop by. Say hi. They are some of the nicest people who will do more than just hand you you’re food."

Brothers 2 Restaurant,Canadian (New),"618 Water Street E Summerside, PE C1N 4H7 Canada",PEI,46.3931755,-63.7688332,4,Food was good and there was someone playing live music Friday evening. I will say as constructive criticism that the spinach dip was a little to watery and the 34$ steak meal was very fatty and chewy.
Brothers 2 Restaurant,Canadian (New),"618 Water Street E Summerside, PE C1N 4H7 Canada",PEI,46.3931755,-63.7688332,4,"Stopped in for dinner the first night while staying in Summerside. Seating was quick, staff were wonderful, server was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.

We sat on the pub/bar side. I believe the restaurant side is a bit quieter. Live music started part way, which was a nice surprise.

Food and drinks were good. Large menu. Standard food."

Lovely atmosphere save the 20 something in the next booth pourng her life story out to daddy, not their fault, just a fact. Fish may have been a tad over done but very good.  Wife loved the lobster. We shared the mushroom soup and the salad.  The soup is to die for, you could walk on the mushrooms, great broth.  Salad and dressing, perfect. Maryse was attentive, chatty and a great server.  All in all, glad our B&B was within walking distance."

FiveEleven West,Buffets,"Credit Union Place 511 Notre Dame St Summerside, PE C1N 1T2 Canada",PEI,46.3978332,-63.8003498,3,"Fries and Onion rings were good. Fish was disappointing, oil must have been too cold as the batter was light, but oil logged and the fish itself wasn't super flavourful or flaky. Scallops and chicken fingers were decent, but the table bread was nearly the highlight of the meal. Service was prompt and friendly."
FiveEleven West,Buffets,"Credit Union Place 511 Notre Dame St Summerside, PE C1N 1T2 Canada",PEI,46.3978332,-63.8003498,5,"Such a little gem of a restaurant. Good food ,good staff, nicely decorated and quiet, prices are abit expensive but the portions and quality make it worth the extra couple dollars.The food was served quickly but not suspiciously fast and the waitress went the extra mile to make my daughter a special drink that wasnt on the menu!"
Star Cafe,Cafes,"271 Water Street Summerside, PE C1N 1B5 Canada",PEI,46.3918345,-63.7909953,4,"Great breakfast , very tasty and a big meal . I recommend this place 👌"
Star Cafe,Cafes,"271 Water Street Summerside, PE C1N 1B5 Canada",PEI,46.3918345,-63.7909953,5,"A delightful hole-in-the-wall gem, tucked away in a crusty decrepit mini-mall with locked washrooms.
Properly folded omelettes, which you  rarely see done right in restaurants. Generous portions. Delish overall."
Star Cafe,Cafes,"271 Water Street Summerside, PE C1N 1B5 Canada",PEI,46.3918345,-63.7909953,5,"A simple little cafe on water street in the McNeil's mall across from the laundry mat. Homey atmosphere and amazing service.

3 of us got a meal for 37 bucks with coffee and got it in 10 minutes of ordering.

The food: Only place in Summerside doing poached eggs and they do them well. Home fries can be grilled or deep fried and they don't skimp on the meat considering the price. My omelet was presented rolled around the bacon which made it look as good as it tasted. Portions are perfect, offering a healthy sized portion but nothing overpowering the rest of the dish (no mountain of home fries but just the right amount) And the coffee is the best in town, much better than any of the chains or local shops and they keep it fresh.

Final thoughts: This is the best breakfast nook in Summerside by leaps and bounds. Get in there and try it!"
Star Cafe,Cafes,"271 Water Street Summerside, PE C1N 1B5 Canada",PEI,46.3918345,-63.7909953,1,"Nice place to eat if it's ever open, half the time it's not even open and really not on the weekends....."

China Star Restaurant,Chinese,"265 Water Street Summerside, PE C1N 1B5 Canada",PEI,46.3917039,-63.7907213,5,"Super tasty food. Very great value. Left absolutely stuffed! Best egg rolls I've had in ages. The beef and broccoli was very well cooked and full of flavour. The fried rice was simple yet delicious.

The sweet and sour sauce was classic and worth the try. Chicken balls were stuffed with chicken and not just breading.

Dining room was clean, quiet and had a lovely atmosphere.

The staff are extremely kind and courteous. The food came fast and they were concerned with our stay and ensured the coffee was topped up and food was good to go.

5 star will go back for sure!"
China Star Restaurant,Chinese,"265 Water Street Summerside, PE C1N 1B5 Canada",PEI,46.3917039,-63.7907213,5,Service is quick and polite. The atmosphere is very comfortable and everything I have tried on the menu has been very good.
China Star Restaurant,Chinese,"265 Water Street Summerside, PE C1N 1B5 Canada",PEI,46.3917039,-63.7907213,2,"I’m very surprised that I had to give such a low rating of this establishment, most reviews I had read prior were a 5 or 4.
The server was very friendly and somewhat attentive, which bumped the rating up to 2 or it would have been a 1.
I had a combination plate ( 1 Egg roll, S &S Chicken balls, Chicken  Chow Mein & Chicken fried Rice) The biggest issue with the meal was with the deep fried items, the oil was very old and made the food taste almost rancid. The chicken fried rice lacked flavour and ingredients. The chicken chow mein was the tastiest but it only came with bean sprouts no egg noodles.
I always give a restaurant a 2nd try before never returning so I’ll try them again in the summer when it’s busier."
China Star Restaurant,Chinese,"265 Water Street Summerside, PE C1N 1B5 Canada",PEI,46.3917039,-63.7907213,5,"This is our go to for Chinese food. The people who work there are friendly. We hardly ever eat in, but it's a nice spot, can be a bit loud at times. Prices are really good!"

The Frosty Treat Dairy Bar,Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt,"109 Victoria Street Kensington, PE C0B 1M0 Canada",PEI,46.4342098,-63.6442367,5,We come here every year on vacation for ice cream because  it's the best around. Today everyone got ice cream and I just wasn't feeling like ice cream so I got the seafood chowder.  Truth be told I wasn't expecting much from an ice cream take out shop.  But I was underestimating for sure. Honestly one of if not the best chowder I have had on the island so far and I have tried it in alot of places.  It was really flavorful and full of seafood not just tons of potatoes like alot of places.  I will be making this a new tradition.
The Frosty Treat Dairy Bar,Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt,"109 Victoria Street Kensington, PE C0B 1M0 Canada",PEI,46.4342098,-63.6442367,5,"My wife's cousin who is a local says this is the best Fish and Chips on the Island. I can't disagree and we have tried a lot of places. She got the 2 piece and we saved the second piece and split it for dinner. I had the double barbeque burger and it was too tall to bite. Since my wife had enough ""chips""for both of us I got the onion rings and they did not disappoint."
The Frosty Treat Dairy Bar,Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt,"109 Victoria Street Kensington, PE C0B 1M0 Canada",PEI,46.4342098,-63.6442367,5,Grew up with this place! Lots of good memories! Took my kids and introduced them to the food and ice cream delights of this place! Definitely a place to take the family. Gluten-free options are available.

Pizza Delight,Pizza,"454 Granville Street Summerside, PE C1N 4K7 Canada",PEI,46.4111223,-63.7837715,1,"I'm only giving a one rating because the service was mediocre. The pizza on the other hand was horrible, very skimpy on the ingredients and the steak on the pizza looked and tasted like processed dog food. Worst meal ever! With Pizza in their name you would think they could make a good pizza. We only dined there because my inlaws made the reservations, i was skeptical because it was total junk the last time I ate there and I wasn't wrong."
Pizza Delight,Pizza,"454 Granville Street Summerside, PE C1N 4K7 Canada",PEI,46.4111223,-63.7837715,2,"Ordered 3 Donairs (wrap style)for takeout 2 weeks ago. They came with the salads. When we got Home we opened them up and they were the flat (pizza style ones) we kindly called back and said we got the wrong ones any chance we could come back to switch them out. Lady said sure. When we arrived back at the store we asked if we could purchase one of the pizza style donairs. All was good, when we asked for the salad with it the lady told us no sorry you don’t get a salad. When I said the other 3 came with one she said rudely that this one wouldn’t be coming with it. Even though i paid the price to have the salad with it. Really didn’t want to argue. So we left.
Feel that once we got the wrong food and complained that the service went from being 10/10 to a 1/10.
The donairs we got were tossed together super fast and had a drop of the sauce.
We won’t be back."
Pizza Delight,Pizza,"454 Granville Street Summerside, PE C1N 4K7 Canada",PEI,46.4111223,-63.7837715,4,"Couldn't decide where to eat last night so stopped in here. The server was very friendly and attentive. The two menu thing was a bit confusing - they've recently merged with a ribs place too. Regardless, we both got panzerottis, my husband had a soup and I had a salad as a side. We were both surprised at how small the panzerottis were - but they were baked and delicious! And by the time we were done eating, it really was the perfect amount.

Salad was really fresh and well put together. Not too much dressing. My husband's soup looked great - really full of chicken and long noodles!

Word of advice - for those who don't eat meat, the sauce they serve with the panzerottis is a beef sauce, but that's not really explained anywhere. It didn't bother me, it was just unexpected."

In the beginning, his new dish, eggplant fabulous, and our main dish was pasta and pork. OMG, it was a flavour explosion. I recommend this place in my top 3 in all of Thunder Bay. Also, they have great wines and drinks without alcohol. In conclusion, you have to go there and taste all"
Tomlin,Canadian (New),"202 1/2 Red River Road Thunder Bay, ON P7B 1A5 Canada",ON,48.4349985,-89.2195484,5,"Tomlin Restaurant was phenomenally AMAZING!!! Four of us went for dinner saturday night & were seated promptly and we got the $75 per person for 4-course meal and the food just kept cominggggg! We really underestimated how much food would be served to us. We were so full that we had to take leftovers away. Now to how the food tasted, every single meal was SOOOO VERY DELICIOUS!!! 😍 All the cocktails we had were wonderful! My fave was the Sloe Gin cocktail! Now I understand why their restaurant was packed that night with a queue in front! The service was also so wonderful. The waitress took her time to explain each meal to us as she served it! Glad we were seated on time and could taste all the wonderful food! 😍❤️ We will definitely go back to Tomlin!!"

We had no expectations walking in, we were visiting the area and were just hungry and looking for a bite to eat.

But WOW, we were blown away. The food was absolutely incredible, we savoured every mouthful and wiped our plates clean. The drinks as well! You could tell there was a lot of thought, careful consideration, and passion poured into every bite and sip. We shared the sweet potato fritters, crispy pork belly, and broken lasagna. All were unbelievable.

And to top off the wonderful eating experience, our server was perhaps one of the best people we have ever met. Shoutout to Stacey! She went above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed our meal, and recommended some amazing dishes and drinks. She was just a delight to chat to, thank you Stacey! We both left Tomlin agreeing that it was the best meal and service we have ever had. Seriously. You have to go!"

While the prices are slightly higher than other places, the food and dining experience is well worth it.  Our server was excellent as was the food.

We started with 2 drinks and then split the red wine of the day to have with our meal.

We had the risotto cheese balls for an appetizer and then split the 2 special entrees of the day, the sticky ribs and pork thai salad (forget the exact name) both dishes were sooo delicious.  The ribs just peeled off the bones and melted in our mouths!

Our server knew that we were splitting the main meals and the wine so she brought 2 wine glasses and a small carafe for the wine plus an extra plate for us to use for dividing the meals.  I love these little extra service touches that make the dining experience even better.

Unfortunately, we didn't save room for dessert, next time, and there will be a next time for sure, we'll go lighter on the meals so  that we can try desserts too."

We ordered the pear and fig pizza, lamb and the mafaldine pasta. The pear and fig pizza was delicious - lots of depth to the dish and the sweet and savoury flavours went very well together! Lamb was good - cooked well and we enjoyed the quinoa it was served with. The pasta was a let down - extremely bland and the pasta was not al dente. The service was average. Overall it was a decent experience."

Located in an old house, the dining area has tons of character; it's small though so no large groups. If you are visiting Thunder Bay and you want pizza, you HAVE to come here. Watch their hours - open Wed-Sat only."

Thai Kitchen,Thai,"11 Cumberland Street S Thunder Bay, ON P7B 2T1 Canada",ON,48.434239,-89.2196699,5,"We were driving from Newmarket, ON to Cold Lake, AB and Thunder Bay was our last stop today. After researching restaurants, my husband found Thai Kitchen and the reviews were too good not to try the food.

My favourite dish to order when visiting a Thai restaurant is always Pad Thai. So after looking at the menu we settled on our orders. But before we placed our order we looked at the surrounding tables and it seemed everyone had spring rolls. Do we decided to order two as an appetizer.

We were not disappointed. The spring rolls arrived, large, piping hot and once we took our first bit, exploding with flavour. Super glad we ordered these.

Finally our main dish arrived (my husband got some spicy chicken rice dish) and I quickly dug in to my pad Thai.  WOW. Lots of peanuts, fresh green onions, plenty of chicken, perfectly cooked noodles and the flavour was outstanding. I can say this was my favourite Pad Thai that I have ever eaten.

The service was prompt, courteous and if you ever come to Thunder Bay, you have to eat here."
Thai Kitchen,Thai,"11 Cumberland Street S Thunder Bay, ON P7B 2T1 Canada",ON,48.434239,-89.2196699,5,First time here and from out of town.  Delicious Market Pad Thai with tofu.  Ordered with no egg and came out perfect.  The vegetable spring rolls are huge and possibly the most delectable spring rolls I have ever eaten.  The flavor and seasonings were amazing.  Price point is perfect and portions were great.  I recommend and would return.
Thai Kitchen,Thai,"11 Cumberland Street S Thunder Bay, ON P7B 2T1 Canada",ON,48.434239,-89.2196699,5,"The restaurant had a lively ambiance, with about 3/4 of the tables occupied when we arrived. The vibrant atmosphere created an exciting energy that added to the overall experience.

We were promptly escorted to our table by a friendly and attentive young lady. Throughout our meal, she consistently checked in on us, refilled our water glasses, and came back regularly to see if there was anything else we needed. Her attentiveness greatly enhanced our dining experience.

Now, to the highlight of the evening: the meal itself. I must say, it was truly excellent. The chef's attention to detail was evident in every bite. The flavors were expertly balanced, and each dish showcased the use of fresh and high-quality ingredients. The presentation was well done, further elevating the entire dining experience.

Based on this culinary delight and the exceptional service, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience. I, for one, will undoubtedly return."

Pros
- Good Ambience

Cons

-We Ordered Diavola Pizza and it was slightly burnt. I am not sure if that's how pizzas are made. But yeah! Nice cutlery and nice sitting.
- Pricey for their type of restaurant but i guess they deserve it as its better than other establishments in the area."

The Keg Steakhouse + Bar - Thunder Bay,Steakhouses,"735 Hewitson Street Thunder Bay, ON P7B 6B5 Canada",ON,48.4057094,-89.2573812,5,"We came to celebrate my son’s graduation (HS) and was his birthday.  We love steak, so we’re eager to try this place.
We found it easily with ample parking.  We tend to eat later- 7pm, so not too crowded.  We had a reservation as we were unsure how busy it would be.
We’re seated immediately and provided drinks and placed our appetizer order. The stuffed mushrooms Neptune -didn’t disappoint!
My son for the New York strip medium well.  It’s usually exactly how he likes steak.  However this New York strip is cut in half horizontally.  So it’s very thin, unlike a regular thick piece of New York strip meat.  So cooking it to medium without much pink - it’s like rubber. I can’t recommend this cut.  The photo showed how thin they slice it.  It’s like half the thickness of a regular piece of meat.  My son got the plate and was like……so, “someone took the top layer”.  Very disappointed young man.

My sirloin was medium and a normal 8oz you would expect.  My only complaint was the amount of pepper.  It’s VERY heavy.  I didn’t order the peppercorn steak.  It would have killed me.  I cut the top layer off my steak to be able to eat it.  My side selection was the baked potato, with just butter.  It was as expected, just very small. For the price, I expected better.

We were too full for dessert, so got it to go.  The chocolate cake and Billy Miner pie. Both were taste lasted that evening.  It was hard to select deserts as they were all great choices.

Overall some hits and misses.  Very disappointed in the New York strip.  Maybe the prime rib is a better option to try next time."

Thankfully we got there early and ordered the nachos. It took over 2 hours to get our meals. Not the same as what it used to be at all. I won't be going back."

The Keg is better in my opinion for a similar price and nicer atmosphere.   It was a Saturday evening and we had a reservation but ended up being seated in a very uncomfortable booth beside a large party.  I think sitting on a piece of concrete would have been about as comfortable.   We had rib eye steak which was tender, other member of our group had prime rib.  Service was slow but waitress was friendly and apologetic."

I walked over from my hotel. I ordered a ceaser drink which was meh. Not sure if it's on the menu or not. Didn't really come with any good garnishes. I ordered the mozzarella sticks and didn't care for them at all. The waitress removed them from my bill. They had a bitter, burnt taste and the cheese was hardly melted. For the entree, I ordered the 10 oz ribeye dinner.  It comes with soup, salad, buns and a side. Decided on the beef barley soup and ceaser salad. The side was a loaded baked potato. The salad barely had any dressing on it so it wasn't great and I didn't finish it. The soup was pretty decent. The meat inside which I'm guessing is leftover prime rib was very tender. The buns were the best part, they were fantastic. The potato was small and burnt, way overcooked. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare which was nice. My server who was the bartender was great."

Somewhat messy, especially with all the empty liquor boxes stacked along the way to the men's washroom (like this every time I've been in).

Had salt and pepper wings and the Buffalo chicken dip. The wings barely had a speck of pepper, let alone salt. The wings were small and somewhat overcooked.

The Buffalo chicken dip was very good, but they’re always stingy on the chips.

The service was poor this time. Weren't even asked if we wanted another drink or more food. Dirty dishes weren't removed. We got tired of being ignored and went up to the till to ask for the bill.

Our server happened to be at the till and said she was ""just"" going to come by. She then asked how things were, and I mentioned the wings. Her response, that's too bad and here's your bill.

I don't know why I still left a tip."

Our server was spectacular & was training another server who is going to do great there. They helped me decide which cocktail to get and I ended up loving it - I got the Amethyst Mine & my husband started with a Caesar which was well garnished. We wanted the Ahi Tuna & Cucumber to start but they were unfortunately out of it so we got the Frito Misto instead. It was delicious & I liked how they put the sauce on the bottom of the dish instead of in ramekins - just made the dish more elevated. We needed help with choosing a bottle of wine that would pair nicely with both of our mains & our server suggested the perfect selection! I got the Shrimp Casarecce which was cooked beautifully & very flavourful with a tasteful amount of spice! My husband got the Striploin Steak which he really enjoyed! They cooked it rare for him even though they suggest MR. No room for dessert but was brought over a menu just to look. We’re really happy with our experience & highly recommend.

The location here is amazing. Loved taking a walk around the water front before and after our meal here. Views from the dining room are lovely too! On this Sunday night we made sure to make a reservation ahead of time as they didn’t have many spots or times slots available."
Bight Restaurant & Bar,Bars,"Prince Arthur's Landing, Marina Park 2201 Sleeping Giant Parkway Thunder Bay, ON P7A 0E Canada",ON,48.4313574,-89.219,5,"Wonderful experience based on two visits here. The service was quick and friendly. The spot itself has a wonderful view but more importantly, the food was very good. Highly recommend the burger or fried chicken sandwich. The flavours, juiciness and quality was great. Even the side of salad was good - similar to the kale poppyseed salad packages you find at grocery stores but of course much more fresh. The trout fish and chips here were not too bad but came with a lot of fries and a smaller amount/size of fish. It's definitely it's own spin and not the kind you find on the east coast of batter. Still worth it to try but share between two people."

First of all, the patio was so beautiful. It was my first time there but everyone else had been before. What a hidden gem. It was completely packed so we were happy we got reservations done about a week ago. I didn't take pictures of the patio to respect other people's privacy but it was beautiful. We loved all our delicious and well presented meals. The portions were large and the meals tasted so fresh. Our waitress was absolutely phenomenally amazing! we loved her and her energy! The cocktails were so good as well! ❤️🥂 We have already planned our next trip there! 😊"

I forgot the name, but we got the sliced beef appetizer and it was soooo good!

It was very quiet when we went, so it felt nice that we weren't squeezed in with other people cause the tables seem pretty close with each other. But, it wasn't rlly a concern tbh.

Overall, we had a good lunch!"
Bar Italia Restaurant,Italian,"168 Court Street S Thunder Bay, ON P7B 2X6 Canada",ON,48.4301879,-89.2281346,3,"Ordered dinner for 4 people this eve. Food was decent. Unfortunately we received the wrong salad but not a huge deal. Was quite disappointed with the pasta and meatballs. Sauce was a plain tomato sauce, pretty mediocre. Only two meatballs compared to the large portion of pasta. Was disappointed as two of us were sharing this dish. Meatballs were good otherwise. Panzos were good as well."

Best garden salad I’ve ever had - excellent balsamic dressing. Wings were ok (soggy but it’s takeout so what can you expect), onion rings were very good, steak bites were so yum. My boyfriends super picky and they accommodated all his needs with the buffalo chicken sandwich. 4 stars because of prices seem a little high for what it was."

We had the steak salad and spicy chicken cashew bowl and they were both excellent. Steak was done medium rare perfectly! Dessert was chocolate caramel cheesecake 😋. 🍺 🍷 yummy too. Took a star off as they seemed to want to direct everyone to the restaurant area and not the bar/lounge area.  They said all the table were booked ( 2 were occupied? ) it was about 7 so not sure. We were happy to sit at the bar…we like to watch the sports, but she had to get permission from the bartender??  We sat there and the bartender provides us with excellent service, but I watched as the hostess continued to this as guests came in … even single older travellers who probably preferred to sit at the bar. Didn’t appear to be a staffing issues…there were lots around.  Just a thought to try to accommodate customers sitting preference 🙃"

Beer on tap is decent selection and is cold. However, the steak bites are way off. It would be better to crisp them like burnt ends and not in a saucy soup bowl :( but definitely not a deal breaker for coming here with friendly staff and good ambiance."

You can fill the bowl as much as you can. You can mix different sauces and they have suggestions for how to do this.
As a vegetarian, I chose tofu, edamame and chickpeas for protein but there were several meats as well."
Mongos Grill,Canadian (New),"1075 Memorial Avenue Thunder Bay, ON P7B 4A4 Canada",ON,48.4051592,-89.244704,5,"First of all I have to say I'm surprised at how good this experience was! My friend recommended the restaurant awhile ago and I happened to stop by today.

First thing I noticed is how popular it must've been around the neighborhood. It's only 3 minutes after the opening hours and there's already two tables, after finishing the food after an hour the number went up to 7.

The waitress and the cook are super friendly, and answered all my questions with extreme politeness and a big smile.😄

Food is exceptional too. All ingredients are freshly cooked and prepared right in front of me and they taste delicious. The amount of customizations you can have is a bit overwhelming for me but I liked every bite in the end.🥣

For an Asian international student like me, the food wasn't too spicy. Four spoons of Szechuan sauce, three little spoons of spice and a bit of chilli sauce at the top gave me a spicy level between ""oh I just ate spicy"" and ""I need some water"". So yeah really not that spicy.

In short, 10/10 would come again."

The service was really great and price was reasonable too.

We could choose the ingredients by ourselves and the kid’s price was very reasonable, 7.99 all you can eat. You can choose as many as you want as long as it does not overflow the bowl. It also has all you can eat option. Like this place."

The staff from the door all the way to being served? Unbelievably amazing! I was so glad that lot 66 had loads of free parking spots too. Lot 66 quickly filled up completely on a Wednesday night so I strongly advise that people make reservations like we did.

We each had a 3 course meal but we only remembered to take some pictures because the presentation was so great that we kept forgetting to take pictures and kept digging in to eat. We had 2 different types of salad for our starters then my husband had the duck (medium) with rice and I had a 16 oz rib eye (medium well) with mashed potatoes. I tasted my husband's duck as well. The entrees were just so delicious as well. Just such a moist melt in your mouth meals. We were celebrating my birthday and I ordered the flourless torte with espresso ice cream for dessert and it was just so delicious. I'm so glad we both kept our tummies empty because their meals are very delicious, very filling and the portions are quite large. We will definitely go back there to eat again.

Easily the best restaurant I've been in Thunder Bay and I eat out a lot!"

That’s pretty much a door slammed shut for seniors and people with disabilities who can’t climb stairs.

The restaurant ambiance was great. I had the rack of lamb, pear blue cheese salad, and cheese cake and it was all delicious.

The server was attentive, however she always was interrupting us mid sentence to ask us how we were doing. She even interrupted us to boisterously tell us which knife was for each dish as she placed each of the knives on the table, it was super weird.

Overall this was a great experience with the exception of the lack of barrier free access to enter the restaurant."

It's my new favorite restaurant in Thunder Bay. Restaurant is beautiful and looks like they have a patio in the summer. Everyone was very friendly, inviting, and efficient. Drinks were great and food was spectacular. They serve delicious focaccia with oil and balsamic once you order. We had the escargot and ahi tuna for appetizers and the duck breast and gorgonzola chicken breast for mains. The food was beautiful and made with so much love. I didn't shut up about my chicken all night and the next day. I'm still drooling over it! Can't wait to go back again.

The best part was the service the server who take care of us and the lady who checked on us(I think she is the manager) was so nice.
Checked with us about the inclusion of pork and was so friendly even though the restaurant was really busy.
To be honest, the quantity of the food is really great for such a price. Food didnt take too long and it was delicious too.
I would totally recommend this place."

Mr. Chinese,Chinese,"615 Arthur Street W Thunder Bay, ON P7E 5R6 Canada",ON,48.3813516,-89.2960906,4,"Dad had consomme with fried noodles which he enjoyed.  FYI it comes with all the noodles already added to broth. If you want ""on the side"" ask when ordering. More broth was offered without our asking so that was cool.

I had big bowl of vegetable soup with plenty of big chunks of broccoli. Also ordered fried noodles side. Vegetables were cooked perfectly and dish was filling. I would have liked a more flavourful broth but I could actually taste the vegetables so this may be by design.

Service was great, we were treated very well, received good attention and enjoyed the time.
I would eat here again."

I also ordered the deep fried soft shelled crab because I've never seen that on a menu before.  Unfortunately, it also didn't have much flavour.
Not my favorite sushi place but it wasn't unsatisfying enough to stop me from finishing it. Staff was friendly."

For a bit of a downer... I said I'd pay to get extra wasabi, soy and ginger for our sushi but was told not to worry and they would make sure I had plenty. I got three Ketchup sized packets of each for an order for 6 people... They did tell me not to pay for extra though so..."
Wasabi Japanese Restaurant,Sushi Bars,"538 Arthur Street W Thunder Bay, ON P7E 5R7 Canada",ON,48.3805372,-89.2915554,2,"We’re consistent costumers of Wasabi and have been for years. This review is in hopes that they get their act together. I don’t know if it’s because they prioritize take out, or because of their lack of staff (was personally told by a worker the owner runs a skeleton crew to save money) but the service and turn around time for water, food and overall time spent in the restaurant is nothing short of deplorable. And it’s not an isolated experience, it’s every single time we visit, which is often.  An hour and 45 minutes to be exact last visit for 3 rolls and an app.  We will be finding a new spot if this doesn’t change for the better soon. The food is always good enough to keep us coming back, the service and pace will be the reason they lose as customers permanently.

Get it together"

It was so hot that the rolls looked like they were melting and tasted so bad the rice was mushy. The pad Thai tasted like plastic we ended up throwing out 60$ of food and the other 60 didn’t show up I’ll never order again!

The combo was good, and the fish was nice. I like that the crab in the Cali rolls weren't imitation crab sticks, it seemed to be crab meat.

Worse still, as I sat at my table for a full 1/2 hour after a family with young children had left, I had to look at uneaten food lying on the floor under their table before it was finally swept up. The kitchen floor was very dirty with cast-aside food lying on it.

Everything was good except the Spring Rolls. They were so soggy and saturated with oil that we couldn't eat them. It really was like chewing leather when I was trying to bite into the end of one. Chicken fried rice was very dry, but I was impressed with the amount of actual chicken in it. Wonton soup, s&s chicken balls, bon bon ribs, vegetables chow mein Shanghai noodles, deep fried wontons, mushroom egg foo young - I think that was about it...

The restaurant itself was not that busy, they have signs up stating they’re only allowed to have five tables at a time due to their shortage of staff.

This made the experience for all so relaxed.
Highly recommend eating at Sushi Station.

Everything was so delicious! The burrito was packed full of flavour, it came with a sauce on the side but honestly I didn't even use it because it was so flavourful. The owner said the London fog would be the best of our lives and it really was! The latte was really smooth and the perfect balance between the coffee and the hazelnut flavour I requested.
Unique deco and super friendly staff, definitely recommended and we'll certainly come back when we're in town."

I would recommend that people that aren't good at matching flavours get the recommended salads or ask for advice but, everything is exceptionally fresh and the dressings are delicious.

Salad ingredients are fresh and delicious every time.   I'll overlook the whole chopsticks for take-out due to everything else about this place being fantastic.
I think that remark I made about the chopsticks earlier, is mainly due to my own chopstick insecurities.  So yeah, that's probably more of a me issue I suppose.
You can place an order for pick up online.  Or place an order when you get there and not have to wait very long for them to throw it all together.
This establishment is going to be around for a long time.  Just from my perspective as a repeat customer,  whenever I am in Rebel Salad, they are constantly preparing online and in person orders.
Walk on in. Construct your masterpiece salad on the paper provided, then pass it to the pro.  A few minutes later, they toss you back your Salad."

I get that mistakes happen but our rice and beef greens were burnt! So I had called and left a message and did not get a call back. So today when I called again, she asked why I didn't bring it back?! 😐 I told her because you were closed and then did not reopen until today! She was yelling at me saying I should have got a taxi and brought it back to prove I am not making it up. I still have it in the fridge to do exactly that but then she proceeded to yell that it wasn't burnt and she remembered my order and I am lying. I am so livid at the way she spoke to me that I want to throw the burnt food at her..needless to say I will not even bother going across town to possibly endure more of this disrespect!"

Mandarin Chinese Restaurant,Caterers,"125 Brodie Street S Thunder Bay, ON P7E 1B8 Canada",ON,48.383111,-89.2468584,1,"Only giving one star because I can't give 0. I'm a PSW in a long term care home and tried to place an order on behalf of a resident. We called when they opened and while I was coordinating with the resident to figure out the order the lady said she needed to put us on hold and placed the phone on the counter. We waited about 10 minutes and then the call dropped. We tried calling back a few more times but the line was busy (assuming phone was still on the counter). We decided to give up and order from Golden Wok instead. After we placed the order, the lady from Mandarin called back to try and finish the order. I apologized and told her we ended up going with another restaurant. She tried calling back a second time but I didn't respond because I had other residents to care for. The lady had my name and the care home address from when we were trying to figure out cost and she decided to call the other restaurant pretending to be me, was rude to the Golden Wok staff member who answered the phone, and cancelled my residents order. I found out when I called Golden Wok back an hour and a half later inquiring about the delivery. The lady from Mandarin also knew I was placing an order to a care home. So she not only cancelled a care home residents order but decided to interfere with another business because she lost a sale. Completely unacceptable and unprofessional behaviour. That lady should be deeply ashamed of her actions."

My family and I do go when we visit relatives in Thunder Bay. When we come back to Alberta we bring back 3 dozen burgers and 36 Persians always and if relatives do go for a visit they bring us back home the same. We will never forget about our favorite food places. We also liked Mama alfas for the extra large pizzas which in Alberta is unheard of. Their extra large is a joke.

Beef dishes were watery and tasteless. Rice was soggy. Vegetable dishes were bland. Chicken balls were hard and tough meat. The service was pleasant. The atmosphere is homey. 3 out of 5 is generous.

Sorry I tried to like it, but worst chinese food and most expensive I have ordered.
Temperature was good and the service was fast as I was told it was busy.  The egg rolls and chicken balls were ok but the garlic ribs were tiny bits with a lot of hard pieces. Chicken fried rice tasteless.  Wonton soup had it's own taste, not the regular taste of a wonton soup.  Ate the stock of the soup but threw the rest in the garbage including the ribs, and rest of rice.  TOO BAD to throw it out since the trio plate at 17.95$, 2 egg rolls (7$), and a soup (7.75$), added up to 45,80$.  Hard to understand the bill but had like 10$+ of extra fees.  With the tip it added up to 53.80$ for a plate, soup and 2 egg rolls.  I understand that taste can be subjective, but all the added fees should have been told and explained to the customer."

The patrons were friendly and respectful. At first I found the service staff a bit intimidating but as the night went on they were fantastic. Little Jordan was an absolute doll and was very personable. The chicken wings were so damn good as well. Keep up the good work!

There are some games like foosball, pool and pins.
May be because it was  a lot of people felt like i was melting with the heat inside the bar.
There will a big line up at the counter to buy drinks.So it will be good to buy as many as u can at frst run.
Even though i heard some bad stories abt the bar, i had no bad experince..

I understand being closed for Thanksgiving day, but why the whole weekend? Also if your going to do that then atleast update your hours on google, so people like me do not drive into town to get everyone on our jobsite Taco Time when it is closed.  Luckily I tried that new BarBurrito across the street and ended up paying far less money for what turned out to actually be better food. I even went back the next day to get more. Needless to say between this and the past screw ups I won't be back. Closing for that weekend was the bitter sweet, as I used to go to TacoTime once or Twice a week and crave it, but now I found something much better tasting and much healthier for less money."

Today, had it on Arthur street before my flight.
2 soft beef tacos and a large mexifry.

Was...not... pleased.

They microwaved my tacos..which were still cold. Barely anything inside them for ""meat"" or any filling ( lettuce,cheese,tomato)
They were horrible.
My fries were soft ( no crunch)
Cold, and very gross.

I might.. order Taco Time next time, but not from here.

There were not a lot of menu options available to get at this time, and we were limited to ordering the Pastor Taco & I think the Chicken Taco. Both orders were good and looked good. The tacos came with 2 sauces.

Probably, the only minor thing I can comment on that did not go right was that the lady did not include any napkins/tissues in the take out bag. We would have appreciated having some included for our takeout because we had the tacos to go and ate it at a park somewhere else.

I will surely try to experience dining in some time in the future. The interiors were themed right, and the place was very homey. I also can only expect some good and personable service received from the restaurant."

We’ve tried the pastor, chorizo, carnitas, and carne ranchera. They used to give lime with the order but now you have to buy it. We also tried the birria soup it was $2 for a mini portion of it but my sister think it’s delicious. I remember they used to have delicious desserts too but they didn’t have anything last time we came to visit. I used to get the hot salsa too and it used to burn my mouth but I guess they watered it down now. Overall, it is $1 taco every Tuesday & Wednesday so what else can you ask for. 👍🏼"

Love the yuzu cocktails and unique take on dishes./ Absolutely love the salmon roll with asparagus and apple. Such an interesting flavour pairing and it was so filling!

Definitely love bringing folks here for the vibe and it’s so conveniently located right off Yonge and Sheppard, near the highway and transit. Parking is tricky if it’s full but other than that it’s a great location.

Make sure to try it out at least once and head over Tuesday and Wednesday for specials."

They have $1 per oyster, which is good for what we came.  We ordered 5 dozen with other food.  Food is acceptional good. Service is fast for the 1st round.  Abit slow for next round as the restaurant got busy at late night.  It is a good place for some drinkz Nd food. Chill and relax.  Highly recommeded."

We had the Seared Salmon roll, Cali Donburi, East and West Coast Oysters, Crispy Pork Belly, and their specialty sakes. Food took a bit to arrive but it was absolutely worth the wait.

Servers were also very friendly. Sometimes took a little to get their attention as it was busy  but generally very attentive.

Consider coming with a group of friends as they have many shareable options.

Overall a great experience, will be coming again in the future."
