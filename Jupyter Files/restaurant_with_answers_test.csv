The Flying Pig,Canadian (New),"1168 Hamilton Street Unit 104 Vancouver, BC V6B 2S2 Canada",BC,49.275039,-123.1220383,5,"I really enjoyed my lunch at this cozy little place in beautiful Yaletown, Vancouver today!
They have a great selection on their menu and their lunch prices are reasonable. What really stood out for me was their warm, attentive and professional service. From the beginning to the end. The host made us feel very welcome and our server took very good care of us the whole time. Due to the winter wonderland feel and all the snow I felt I need to start things off with a nice cup of coffee. I loved the coffee. It was JJ Bean and piping hot and served in a sparkling cup.....exactly the way I like it.

We had the Pulled Pork Sandwich and the Chicken cutlets.
I loved the pulled pork, juicy and well seasoned with a nice crisp fresh ceasar salad and a slice of gherkin with the meal which was a nice touch. I love gherkins!

I also tried the Chicken cutlet which was beautifully cooked. Tender with the batter seasoned just on point and the mash was a perfect pairing.

The Flying Pig,Canadian (New),"1168 Hamilton Street Unit 104 Vancouver, BC V6B 2S2 Canada",BC,49.275039,-123.1220383,5,"Ambiance is great with a great mixture of wood and metal, light and dark, hard and soft. To drink I had their homemade ginger beer which was tangy and a hint sweet. For dinner, I ordered the short rib with a side of the corn. Both were outstanding! The short rib was served with the bone marrow which was an interesting touch. I didn't care for the marrow alone, but when I added a little piece to the meat, it was a brilliant combination! The corn was superb too .... sweet, but spicy due to the jalapeños. Definitely fresh corn too because I had to pull a string from my teeth :-)  Would definitely recommend this place!

Check it out, Vancouver!",Ambiance is great with a great mixture of wood and metal,0.067338273

Whilst travelling through Canada for the past weeks this was most definitely the BEST meals we have had! The menu is outstanding and so is the quality of the food and drinks. Bailey was our server both nights and is an absolute delight. She was warm and genuine and has an excellent knowledge of the menu.

Kingyo,Japanese,"871 Denman Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2L9 Canada",BC,49.2906122,-123.1370947,5,"During my 5-day stay in Vancouver, I couldn't resist visiting the lovely Japanese restaurant not once, but twice. Its authentic flavors, serene ambiance, and impeccable service left an indelible mark.

Kingyo,Japanese,"871 Denman Street Vancouver, BC V6G 2L9 Canada",BC,49.2906122,-123.1370947,5,"The restaurant caught our attention when we walked by the restaurant around 11:50am - people were lining up for the restaurant to open at noon. We were lucky to get the bar seating. It’s not a huge restaurant and some tables were reserved for customers who made advanced reservations. We ordered hot green tea, Stone-Grilled Beef Tongue, Beef Tenderloin Steak Bowl, Sizzling Stone Pork Kakuni Bowl, and all of them were delicious! Great meat quality and well prepared dishes. It’s a restaurant running by Japanese with great foods and services. I highly recommend this place with advanced reservation.",Great meat quality,0.397712886

The ramen was not bad. Just that the beef was a bit chewy. The pressed salmon sushi wasn’t very good. Too much rice and the rice was not fresh. The place was packed.

Miku,Japanese,"200 Granville Street Suite 70 Vancouver, BC V6C 1S4 Canada",BC,49.2868259,-123.112583,5,"Wow... Wow... Wow... bite after bite was a sublime experience in what Japanese fine dining can be.  Miku is a five star experience that deserves your visit.

The modern restaurant is beautiful, clean, and perfectly maintained.  We recommend sitting on the patio where you can either people watch or gaze over the harbour.  Inside tables offer window views or a view of the open kitchen.  It's all beautiful and adds to the experience.

Service is professional, friendly, and gracious.  We followed our server's recommendations and that was the right choice.  A team of people keeps the meal moving along and provides explanations of what you are eating.

However, the food is the star here and that is how it should be.  The flavors are carefully paired here and you will want to give those flavors a chance to delight your palette.  This is NOT sushi to be dunked in soya sauce.  I think you will also be delighted by how their cocktails complement the food choices.

Put Miku on your ""special meal out"" list and make an evening of it.  This is one of Vancouver's dining gems and certainly the best Japanese cuisine I have eaten.  I think you will agree.","The modern restaurant is beautiful, clean, and perfectly maintained",0.240943998

We ordered the tasting menu and it was amazing, but maybe one course too long. It was a lot of very delicious food but after the 4th course it just became a lot, and we didn’t end up eating some of the dishes because we were so full.

Miku,Japanese,"200 Granville Street Suite 70 Vancouver, BC V6C 1S4 Canada",BC,49.2868259,-123.112583,3,"Upon entering the restaurant for a evening dinner date, it was quite spacious and I saw a sign that the restaurant was one of the nominees for a Michelin star. The lighting in the room isn't very flattering if you take pictures of your group but at least the food had decent lighting. The server we had was friendly and knowledgeable about recommendations. We ended up getting the platter, sashimi, salad, and brussel sprout appetizer to share between 2 people. When the food arrived, the portion size was really small but it was to be expected of a upscale restaurant.  The taste was fresh but I felt like other Japanese restaurants I've tried were above in quality and taste so it was really nothing special that jumped out at me. Perhaps only the sashimi presentation was unique with the cool ice mist. I guess I should've ordered more because I was left feeling hungry still but my date had a budget and I didn't want to scare him away with my huge appetite. Next time I'd like to try the lunch menu instead.",one of the nominees for a Michelin star,0.024015646
